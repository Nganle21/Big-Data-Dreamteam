

wake up, get paid
'nother dollar, 'nother day
go and throw it all away
on cartier
creme de la creme
put my faith in the fun
it's a ritual i live
tonic and gin

i've been seeing saints holding hands
and my god is trans
and everyone feels alive
and i like to do what's in vogue
not what i've been told
cross my heart and hope to die

maybe i overcompensate
call it my naïvet 
but i don't wanna go through the motions
maybe i put it on display
say some things i shouldn't say
'cause i don't wanna go through the motions
i don't wanna go through the motions

and i'm not sure
of anything but couture
and you can say "c'est la amour"
what i live for
it's all first class
when i'm burning through the cash
when the jet starts to crash
beautiful trash

i've been seeing saints holding hands
and my god is trans
and everyone feels alive
and i like to do what's in vogue
not what i've been told

but i don't wanna go through the motions
maybe i put it on display
say some things i shouldn't say
'cause i don't wanna go through the motions
i don't wanna go through the motions
i don't wanna go through the motions

it's all chanel, go straight to hell
i wish you well, i kiss and tell
my soul to sell 'cause i don't wanna go through the motions
yves saint laurent, do what you want
light cigarettes and restaurants
i preach it wrong
'cause i don't wanna go through the motions

maybe i overcompensate
call it my naïvet 
but i don't wanna go through the motions
maybe i put it on display
say some things i shouldn't say
'cause i don't wanna go through the motions
i don't wanna go through the motions
i don't wanna go through the motions

i think i'm in love

okay, this verse is about my best friend, bad as she can be
the only one that's on her level happens to be me
she'll give you a sprinkle, to them flounders bottom feeding
but ween 'em, as quick as she get that peen
and ditch like a queen can
, after dinner i like that dessert
but he thirsty like he in the desert

cut, print, this scene is done
nice to know, you all so nice to know

oh my god
bionik, bionik
iconic, iconic


la carolin' with carolyn
caroline but i had to make it rhyme, i'm
addicted to that weather like heroin
that is why i cannot give it any time, just say no 
it's too good to me, you are too good to me
o.d. on compliments, i need some oxygen
so i dip to the pnw, some of ya don't need where that is   good 
need a little solitude with my crew
'membering what's real is what makes you you, oh 
it's too good to me, know it's no good for me
i can't be out here homie, what it used to be
sitting in bed like "man ", wishing
itching for days with no end
sound checks, checks in, audiences rapping
getting full of that adrenaline, eat it up like satan
you can't have it? take it, you can't man up? k then
breaking up my cadence, got that willpower like jaden, blaow 

and we keep it going up
make it go around, around, again
and we keep it going up
going up
and we keep it going up
make it go around, around, again
and we keep it going up
going up

flying into paris with sophia eris
had a heart to heart over fresh croissant
wondering why these dudes be tripping
she like "girl i'm past giving a damn "
yolo, guess that's why he want a photo
dressed in polo, arm around me after the show
but never there when i need hoes
open mind but my heart closed, ah 
where ya been? back again, young man?
i remember you from way way when
you never gave it or reciprocated
but when i bounced for my sake, you peeped your mistake
"she left me" is always the excuse
i swear there should be support groups for men without lizzo
meet once a week and deal with y'all issues
google me and jack off in a tissue

yeah  you know what though?
we keep it going up
make it go around, around, again
and we keep it going up
going up
and we keep it going up
make it go around, around, again
and we keep it going up
going up

i will never be the person that you want me to
feeling like i can't amount in what i'm 'sposed to do
but i'm here now, like how this happen?
head in the pillows, i'm crunching on cap'n
i'm chilling, i swear i been chilling
taking a break, feeling hella breakable
i was taught that life has no regrets and no mistakes, no no
bet i made some, granted
but my heart cold bruh, definitely definitely granite
wrote this song halfway to chicago
wondering if i should call you
what, to make you feel special?
would it give me reasons to forget you?
 hey, you reached lizzo. leave me a message.. 
i'm out of state, out of time
you more like out of sight, out of mind

yeah  you know what though?
we keep it going up
make it go around, around, again
and we keep it going up
going up
and we keep it going up
make it go around, around, again
and we keep it going up
going up

so sweet, so beautiful
everyday like a queen on her throne
don't nobody knows how she feels
aicha, lady one day it will be real
she moves, she moves like a breeze
i swear i can't get her out of my dreams
to have her shining right here by my side
i'd sacrifice all them tears in my eyes
aicha aicha   smile for me now
aicha aicha   my my my
aicha aicha   passing me by
aicha aicha   in my life
she holds her child to her heart
makes her feel like she is blessed from above
falls asleep underneath her sweet tears
her lullaby fades away with his fears
aicha aicha   smile for me now
aicha aicha   my my my
lord knows the way she feels
everyday in his name she begins
to have her shining right right here by my side
i'd sacrifice all them tears in my eyes
aicha aicha   smile for me now
aicha aicha   ecoute moi
aicha aicha   passing me by
aicha aicha   my my my
aicha aicha   smile for me now
aicha aicha   in my life

say you wanna get involved
maybe you should tell your face
'cause i don't wanna take the fall
every time you go insane
i can't understand you when you talk like that
waiting on something that's never coming back
looking for proof, but the proof's that drug
you can never get enough of

ohh 
why you wanna play me like a chump?
won't you go and play with someone else
why you wanna do me like that, do me like that?
oww 
why don't you just tell me what you want?
you don't have to play me like a chump
why you wanna do me like that, do me like that?
why you wanna do me like that?
why you wanna do me like that, do me like that?

the photographs on your wall
make you feel like you're getting older
but freedom is not a loner
i'd even sing it to you when i'm sober
how close can you get to the edge?
that's the real measure of success
you like playing russian roulette
with five and a half bullets

ohh 
why you wanna play me like a chump?
won't you go and play with someone else
why you wanna do me like that, do me like that?
oww

pumping our hearts in time

coal and flame
melting those ice hands
an air of mixed feelings
beneath fallen ceilings
seal the gates
before what's out is in
or offer a treaty
a chance for reprieve
just let these tunnels cave
just let this fire fade
maybe the sky'll break
we're just a lie away
from proving to ourselves we're not afraid
and now
these silver screens, these scripted dreams
and now
we're suddenly
fates latest casualties
fates latest casualties
fates latest casualties
fates latest casualties


try not to think about it, but you remind
that we are heading in the wrong direction
you make me sick and tired, no, never learn
you put yourself on top and that just makes me
slip and slide and see my color fade
come a time when i can put no more in
i try to do right until my heart breaks
in need of repair, it won't be you i'm calling

try take me down, i'll be right up
'cause you aim too low and i've had enough

always been top rated
you think you can change it?
think that you can change it?
top, top, top, top rated

now there's no walking round it, your attitude
keep barking at the top but i'm an underdog
i'm quitting sick and tired, no crown in your empire
diy pedestals are just what makes me
slip and slide and see my color fade
come a time when i can put no more in
i try to do right until my heart breaks
in need of repair, it won't be you i'm calling

you say you're happier with him now

our love's for real
how'd it take a long, long time
to let us feel?
try to relate in my state
and the aura around me says
my love is for real

touching your face
how'd it take a long, long time
to be here?
turning the wheel on my street
my heart still skips a beat
it's echoing, echoing, echoing, echoing, echoing, echoing

baby, baby, baby
i've been searching for you
i want to be in love
baby, baby, baby
i've been waiting, waiting, waiting my whole life
for someone like you

a love so real

 verse 1 
spend a little too much time together
forgotten how to be all by ourselves
could be worse, yeah it could be better
stay inside beyond all others
help won t get me out of bed
stop the voices in my head
waste away with you instead alone, alone
the great inside and fortitude
safely home alone with you
wasting time but what a view you are
 pre chorus 
nobody told me when you love someone for real
that your mind s on hold and your heart s behind the wheel
 chorus 
i'm so caught up with you
slow love in solitude
don't eat and we drink too much
four walls and that one room love
we ll drift away again
you give me something to numb the pain
we don't talk and we keep the door shut
we re together just a little too much
 bridge 
i'll lay awake in the middle of the night thinking about home
feel so alone though i'm with you
not the same as i used to be
my friends all lost touch with me
and there's nobody to blame but myself

from a black widow's reckoning
your fortuitous spine
opened up like a marionette
danced a whimsical pride
lend a hand to the silver blade
stir your gut 'til it pours
fill our cups with profanity
'til the earth is stained orange

how my tongue dried into the dust
how my skin willed a lie
drill a hole in the field
just the size of my thighs

feel as lonely as i do
feel as lonely as i do
feel as lonely as i do, as i do
feel as lonely as i do, i do

dried up seeds neath our parting seas
floating pears on the tide
slow motion to drown me
roaming streams from our eyes

how my tongue dried into the dust
how my skin willed a lie
drill a hole in the field
just the size of my thighs

feel as lonely as i do
feel as lonely as i do
feel as lonely as i do, as i do
feel as lonely as i do, i do

hold the pain in a soft crux
with our palms facing up
push it thoroughly through and through
this is ours to drink up
oh, the madness in weakness
doubled o'er on the plate
fill an ocean with weaponry
hurricanes of our grace

feel as lonely as i do, as i do
feel as lonely as i do, i do
feel as lonely as i do


all of my mouth was kissing him
now, into the air, i am missing him
is this excess texting a blessing?
two music nerds obsessing

he reminds me of the love in me
i'm celebrating on a vibrancy
sending each other mp3s
falling in love to a song

this handsomest of wickermen
he asked if i could wait for him
now, how many lightyears this interim
while i fall in love with his songs?

his hands are good in protecting me
touching and caressing me
but would it be trespassing
wanting him to be blissing me
robbing him of his youth?

cliffhanger like suspension
my longing has formed its own skeleton
bridging the gap between singletons
sending each others these songs

the interior of these melodies
is perhaps where we are meant to be
our physical union a fantasy
i just fell in love with a song

so, i reserve my own intimacies
i bundle them up in packages
my rawward longing far too visceral
did i just fall in love with love?

we know where all the red ferns grow
two feet against me, but beyond my reach
six keys, one whole heart for each, one whole wave for me
grass stains cut my bloody knees, it s goodpain it means i can t be phased
that little death inside my sides won t make it right
he wins every time i find myself inside, alone all night
i ll be howling keeping you between my eyes, there i ll be alright
i ll be howling keeping you between my eyes, there i ll be alright
rorschach the pieces that i lack
i felt stained, cold beneath the waves, behind my suchered face
cursed down, throw my certain doubt, let me let you down
that little death inside my sides won t make it right
he wins every time i find myself inside, alone all night
i ll be howling keeping you between my eyes, there i ll be alright
i ll be howling keeping you between my eyes, there i ll be alright


just a little bit tired of you
just a little bit lonely for you
just a little bit high, get out of my mind
'cause i can't stop thinking of you
feel a little bit sorry, but i wanna get on it with you
i don't wanna waste time
i don't wanna say bye, no

i feel it in my head, feel it in my heart, feel it in my body
but i can't say no
no, i can't say no
you're playin' with my head
playin' with my heart
playin' with my body
but i can't let go
no, i can't let go

i fuckin' hate you
but i love you just the same
you tear my heart out
in just the perfect way
so fuckin' twisted, the way i play your game
but i can't help it
i love you just the same

i love you just the same
 i love you just the  

i'm a little bit crazy for you
just sitting here waiting for you
i'm a little bit down
i'm just gonna go out
i don't wanna be home without you
feel way too sorry
but i'm gonna get on it with you
it's the middle of the night
and i'm not saying bye, no

i feel it in my head, feel it in my heart, feel it in my body
but i can't say no
no, i can't say no
you're playin' with my head
playin' with my heart
playin' with my body

 i love you just the same 

i fuckin' hate you
but i love you just the same
you tear my heart out
in just the perfect way
so fuckin' twisted, the way i play your game

she's a psycho from a midwest suburb
no straightjacket could hold her
wild eyes, they would lure me in her trap
i go mad just to hold her

until i noticed that something was strange
out of my range, there was no way back
something went off in my brain
she was insane, here she goes again
a psycho from a midwest suburb
i woke up and i told her

you won't know me when the feeling's all gone
and i tell everyone
and the look on your face will slowly come undone
'cause it was all a front
and quietly, i say it to your face
that you will need to find another place to stay
and no you won't know me when the feeling's all gone
and i tell everyone, ay

she's a loose cannon with a temper, so absurd
hiding from the police, yeah
took pills with the name i'd never heard
but they were for sleep, she fooled me

that's when i noticed that something was strange
out of my range, there was no way back
something went off in my brain
she was insane, here she goes again
a psycho from a midwest suburb

bound into a stasis
looking for a way out
i can see through your eyes
cities' walls, fears i'll ever know

but to you, it's not enough
but to you, it's not enough
but to you, it's not enough
but to you, it's not enough

want to live and wanna die
rest of us are wasting time
caught in the middle of our fate

i walked across an empty land
i knew the pathway like the back of my hand
i felt the earth beneath my feet
sat by the river and it made me complete

oh simple thing, where have you gone?
i'm getting tired and i need someone to rely on

i came across a fallen tree
i felt the branches of it looking at me
is this the place we used to love?
is this the place that i've been dreaming of?

oh simple thing, where have you gone?
i'm getting old and i need something to rely on

and if you have a minute why don't we go
talk about it somewhere only we know?
this could be the end of everything
so why don't we go
somewhere only we know
somewhere only we know

oh simple thing, where have you gone?
i'm getting old and i need someone to rely on
so tell me when you're gonna let me in
i'm getting tired and i need somewhere to begin

so if you have a minute why don't we go
talk about it somewhere only we know?
this could be the end of everything
so why don't we go
somewhere only we know
somewhere only we know

it's hard to hear
you're in and out
i can tell you're running
oh, it never ends
better off or better out?
body lover or wrecker?
there's a lot still to live for
there's a lot going on, let it out
find a light in a cold color
finding me, finding a bed of roses
i think i know me now
i think i know
i think i, i think i know
i think i, i think i know


you call me to tell me what's up with you
huh?
we're living on top of the world it seems
way up here in a higher place
what's our time?
are you coming over?

thinking i can hold onto, oh
clouds that i keep falling through

just wanna get to know ya
just wanna get to know ya
'cause you don't even know me  just want to... 
just wanna get to know ya  just want to... 

like a fire, you're burning me up
oh
take cover
'cause we're gonna float up to this feeling of a higher place
it's our world
it's our world

and maybe we can hold onto, oh
these clouds that i keep falling through

just wanna get to know ya
just wanna get to know ya
'cause you don't even know me  just want to... 
just wanna get to know ya  just want to...

me
you don't know
me

missing you felt like pulling teeth
i taste the metal when you're next to me
it's so cold and sweet
it makes me wanna take it back
to the night when your car died
kissing in the rain on a summer night
it was warm and sweet
it makes me wanna take it back
kissing you felt like a lack of strength
the touch of your lips made my legs go weak
it was warm and sweet
it made me wanna take it back
to the night when it all began
i thought that fun was what i wanted then
something cold but sweet
i wish that i could get that back
wish that i could feel like that
wish that i could get it
but remember what it felt like
when you told me it was the last time

i'm singing at a funeral tomorrow
for a kid a year older than me
and i've been talking to his dad; it makes me so sad
when i think too much about it i can't breathe

and i have this dream where i'm screaming underwater
while my friends are all waving from the shore
and i don't need you to tell me what that means
i don't believe in that stuff anymore

jesus christ, i'm so blue all the time
and that's just how i feel
always have and i always will
i always have and always will

i have a friend i call
when i've bored myself to tears
and we talk until we think we might just kill ourselves
but then we laugh until it disappears

and last night i blacked out in my car
and i woke up in my childhood bed
wishing i was someone else, feeling sorry for myself
when i remembered someone's kid is dead

jesus christ, i'm so blue all the time
and that's just how i feel
always have and i always will
i always have and always will

and it's 4am, again
and i'm doing nothing
again


i know i'm a mess, i didn't choose it  i didn't choose it 
i know you're scared i'm gonna lose it  i'm gonna lose it 
and now i'm just waiting for someone to take me
and tell me that i'm doing fine
'cause you won't fuck off of my mind
 'cause you won't fuck off of my mind 

i'm sorry and i hate the old me
i don't know how not to be lonely
i didn't believe that
loving was easy
i'm sorry for all of my phases
but you're giving me all your patience
and i'm never leaving
and you are the reason
you are the reason
you are the reason

i know i'm lost, i couldn't fake it  i couldn't fake it 
it's all too much for you to take, yeah  for you to take, yeah 
and now i'm just waiting for someone to take me
and tell me that we'll be alright
'cause you won't fuck off of my mind

i'm sorry and i hate the old me
i don't know how not to be lonely
i didn't believe that
loving was easy
i'm sorry for all of my phases
but you're giving me all your patience
and i'm never leaving
and you are the reason

and now i'm just waiting for someone to take me
and tell me that i'm doing fine

"hey, you're the comeback kid"

i couldn't speak so i slurred while i looked for a word
but you left just before i could find it
i sat by myself and i stared at the pictures of you on the wall

i kissed the floor, curled up in a ball
there's nothing coming out of my mouth so i said nothing at all

babe, you've got a face like thunder
always trying to get out with another
just stay still 'til i say it's over
babe, you've got a face like thunder

and you question your lover, did she really believe
that this new taste of love is obsolete?  
it just couldn't compete and so you ll keep dragging your body through life by the hair so you can say that you've been somewhere and you don't care of your receipt
you're sentenced to death and you can't be reprieved

babe, you've got a face like thunder
always trying to get out with another
just stay still 'til i say it's over
babe, you've got a face like thunder

say sorry for a while, for a while, for a while
you know i didn't mean it
i said something terrible and i tried to redeem it
i can be so cruel although i don't seem it

babe, you've got a face like thunder
always trying to get out with another
just stay still 'til i say it's over
babe, you've got a face like thunder


veux tu venir avec moi
on s'en va où tu veux
mais laisse moi t'arracher de ceux
qui s'inventent des dieux

l'endroit où t'es le mieux

tu changes et je m'ennuie
de mon meilleur ami

moi, je fais quoi, je fais quoi?
j'attends de devenir folle pour voir ce que tu vois
toi, qu'est ce tu fous, qu'est ce tu fous?
on dirait qu'tu d colles et que tu deviens fou
fou, fou

je d couvre la face cach e de ton visage
comme les traits effac s sous une belle image
je lis dans tes yeux comme dans un livre ouvert
et m me si tu le refermes, je peux lire au travers

et l , j'le vois, tu t'enfonces
  chercher des r ponses
tu fabules, tu d lires
plus rien ne te fait rire
tu mens, tu oublis
t'en dors plus la nuit
tu bois et quoi encore
en autant que tu perdes le nord

moi, je fais quoi, je fais quoi?
j'attends de devenir folle pour voir ce que tu vois
toi, qu'est ce tu fous, qu'est ce tu fous?
on dirait qu'tu d colles et que tu deviens fou
fou, fou

used to be vulnerable
used to be dumb
i used to give it all, mmm
hot like a firestone
100 degrees
oh but now i'm so cold when they kiss me, they touch me, they freeze
they say

why'd you never trust?
why'd you never love?
why'd you never let 'em in?
why'd you wake up with somebody in your bed again?
and say you love them till you leave
why you out so late
dancing with your fake friends
getting in a state?
when the good guys come why'd you run away?
why'd you hurt them?
well i'll tell you

when you're young and you get your heart  broken
and he leaves, leaves the scars open
when you can't believe it's over
that's when you get a little colder
yeah, when your heart's broken
and he leaves, leaves the scars open
drunk cry crying on his shoulder
that's when you get a little colder

they'd have to break me down
show me real love
oh, but lately these boys, all they do is they fuck my head up
they say

why'd you never trust?
why'd you never love?
why'd you never let  em in?
why'd you wake up with somebody in your bed again?
and say you love them till you leave
don't you wanna stay?
don't you wanna try?
putting up a fight
deep down you know
you know you could make it right
don't just give in
oh no

when you're young and you get your heart  broken
and he leaves, leaves the scars open
when you can't believe it's over
that's when you get a little colder
yeah, when your heart's broken
and he leaves, leaves the scars open
drunk cry crying on his shoulder
that's when you get a little colder

oh na na, oh na na, oh na na
that's when you get a little colder  oh na na 
when you let your guard go  oh na na 
when you let your heart fall  oh na na 
when it starts to hurt oh

when you're young and you get your heart broken
and he leaves, leaves the scars open
when you can't believe it's over
that's when you get a little colder  that's when you get 

when you're young and you get your heart broken
and he leaves, leaves the scars open

half a mind to leave the ground
our days like silk, all spun around
you kept me close, one inch off the cosmos
where you're never alone

blue wings to lift me up
 heartbeat stops, you lift me up 
under the wire comes my love
 heartbeat stops, you lift me up 
blue wings to lift me up
 heartbeat stops, you lift me up 
under the wire comes my love
 heartbeat stops, you lift me up 

all my fears in a steam room stall
i sweat and sweat 'til i've had enough
'til i'm in first place
'til our horse comes out ahead
and my chest is full

blue wings to lift me up
 heartbeat stops, you lift me up 
under the wire comes my love
 heartbeat stops, you lift me up 
blue wings to lift me up
 heartbeat stops, you lift me up 
under the wire comes my love
 heartbeat stops, you lift me up 

there goes my life
there goes


you wake up late, you feel your heart begin to work
and now you're all dressed up of course
and hailing cabs out of your door
on 14th street i feel my head between my knees
and orange swimming through the trees
and orange swimming through the trees
where could i go? what could i do?
put in the state, my lips and eyes give me away
and now there s nothing, i can say no
i'm pulled away, i see another of myself
who's found true love and happiness
to sit and smoke there on the chair for

two boys, one to kiss your neck
and one to bring you breakfast
get you out of bed when
you're sore from the night before
from knocking on my door
your head against the floor boards
two boys, one to love you sweetly
one does so discreetly
never will he meet me
but i'm sure that you'll catch your breath
you'll sleep into the day
to wake up with sunlight across your room

before i leave i want to try to go back in time
to just that moment in my life where i should have spoke up but i lied
as i sat there with my jaw open and i smiled
he pulled his sweater off and tried to explain he'd all but given up on love
i'm pulled away, i see another of myself who's found true love and happiness
to sit and smoke there on the chair
beside the bed i read this past week's new yorker
and i watch him paint antarctica, and watch him paint antarctica

two boys, one to kiss your neck
and one to bring you breakfast
get you out of bed when
you're sore from the night before
from knocking at my door
your head against the floor boards
two boys, one to love you sweetly
one does so discreetly
never will he meet me
but i'm sure that you'll catch your breath
you'll sleep into the day
to wake up with sunlight across your room

telling me something or nothing
never the one thing i wanna hear
telling me something or nothing
never the one thing i wanna hear
telling me something or nothing
never the one thing i wanna hear


oh take it slow 'cause i m a lover not a fighter babe

and all of the signs point away but i stay

in the champagne drought i lost my mind
so i started smoking cigarettes with boxed wine
when i made a sound, my neighbors cried
said all my songs sound just like drunken lullabies
said i couldn't change, so i broke the mold
and i put my dreams in bottles knowing they would float
to a better place where i could be myself
don't wanna be another blonde doll on the shelf

every day all day
every day all day
ah a, ah a ah a
i hear choirs in my head
they won't stop until i'm dead
ah a, every day all day
ah a ah a, every day all day
i hear choirs in my head, in my head

and i like to think they're all my friends
when i fall apart they put me back together again
it's like they see and understand
every day, all day, every day when
people show their teeth, don't bite your tongue
baby, you're a diamond shining with no lights on
if it gives you peace, keep raising hell

every day all day

long time
eighteen years i've spent
waiting for this
now my mother's home
my sister sleeps
and i'm awake
making my bed
and our hearts break
'cause i got lost
i'm awake
making my bed

push me aside when the day ends and my light is gone
put me aside for a lifetime, put my lifeline so you feel you've won
i know i may look opaque
i may look like i've made way too many mistakes

i know the fire has burnt out
know i gotta leave now
if a love was easy  hold on to life 
if there was an endless sanity that i could hold on to
 hold on to life 
when i touch you
 hold on to life 
hold on to

love is blind when the lights go out
can't see the shadows flowing
can't see the curtains closing and i'm telling you
love is blind when the lights go out
in a shattered sky we're one star down

pull me close in the sunset when the light is turned on
pull me aside, am i ready yet, for the heaviness
it's getting darker now
i know i may look a little dazed
burn on the edge, acting like it phases me

i know the fire has burnt out
now i gotta leave now
if a love was easy  hold on to life 
if the walls an endless entity that i could hold on to
 hold on to life 
when i touch you
 hold on to life 
hold on to

love is blind when the lights go out
can't see the shadows flowing
can't see the curtains closing and i'm telling you
love is blind when the lights go out
in a shattered sky we're one star down

taking the air from the room
strumming on words that you don't say
gone is the person you knew
you never loved me anyway

love is blind when the lights go out
can't see the shadows flowing
can't see the curtains closing and i'm telling you
love is blind when the lights go out
love is blind when the lights go out
 when i'm losing you 
can't see the shadows flowing
can't see the curtains closing and i'm telling you
love is blind when the lights go out
 losing you 
in a shattered sky we're one star down
 burning up 
when i'm losing you


sometimes i think i'm a killer
scared you in your house
even scared myself by talking
about dahmer on your couch

but i can't sleep next to a body
even harmless in death
plus i'm pretty sure i'd miss you
faking sleep to count your breath

can the killer in me
tame the fire in you?
is there nothing left to do for us?
i am sick of the chase
but i'm hungry for blood
and there's nothing i can do

but when i'm sick and tired
when my mind is barely there
when a machine keeps me alive
and i'm losing all my hair

i hope you kiss my rotten head
and pull the plug
know that i've burned every playlist
and given all my love

can the killer in me
tame the fire in you?
i know there's something waiting for us
i am sick of the chase
but i'm stupid in love
and there's nothing i can do
and there's nothing i can do


i come home in the morning light
my mother says, "when you gonna live your life right?"
oh mama dear, we're not the fortunate ones
and girls   they wanna have fun
oh, girls just wanna have fun
the phone rings in the middle of the night
my father yells, "what you gonna do with your life?"
oh daddy dear, you know you're still number one
but girls   they wanna have fun
oh, girls just wanna have fun

that's all they really want

you said you loved me like an animal
stayed beside me
just enough to keep your belly full
then you took me down to the water got your mouth all clean
left me drowning once you picked me out your bloody teeth

spent the autumn
in the forest hunting for a wolf
tried to find you
stopped my searching when the nights grew cold
dreamt i saw you down by the water with your mouth still clean
you were searching   i came to you and you said to me
that i'm not  

only what you wanted for a little while
only what you wanted for a little while
only what you wanted for a little while
only what you wanted for a little while

through the winter
i was shuttered in between my sheets
checked the window
just to see if you d come back to me
the spring was coming, i saw you running down to the creek
a ring finger fell to the water from your bloody teeth
i guess i'm  

only what you wanted for a little while
only what you wanted for a little while
only what you wanted for a little while
only what you wanted for a little while

remember those summer nights
we were hanging out you and i
sippin' gin till the morning light
those were the days
young and out of control
it's a bomb waiting to explode
yeah, we knew how to steal the show
those were the days

we were smoking weed and drinking hard
dancing on tables in the bar
then we hit the road in your daddy's car
he didn't know

singing ey oh, we are the wild ones
living life 'cause you're only a child once
nothing's gonna come between us
nothing's gonna come between us
ey oh, we are the wild ones
bring it on, gotta try everything once
nothing's gonna come between us
yeah, we are, we are the wild ones
we are, we are the wild ones
yeah, we are, we are the wild ones

we kept skipping school
to go swimming in the neighbour's pool
yeah, we did what we wanted to
those were the days

we were smoking weed and drinking hard
dancing on tables in the bar
then we hit the road in your daddy's car
he didn't know
we would start a fight and run away
the only rules were the ones we made
so reckless and not thinking straight
but we didn't care

singing ey oh, we are the wild ones
living life 'cause you're only a child once
nothing's gonna come between us
nothing's gonna come between us
ey oh, we are the wild ones
bring it on, gotta try everything once
nothing's gonna come between us
yeah, we are, we are the wild ones
we are, we are the wild ones
yeah, we are, we are the wild ones

oh, what i wouldn't give
to go back to those days again
yeah, we had the world to ourselves

we were smoking weed and drinking hard
dancing on tables in the bar
then we hit the road in your daddy's car
he didn't know

singing ey oh, we are the wild ones
living life 'cause you're only a child once
nothing's gonna come between us
nothing's gonna come between us

whatever happened to predictability?
the milkman, the paperboy, the evening tv?
how did i get delivered here? somebody tell me please
cause this old world is just really confusing me

clouds as mean as you've ever seen
ain't a bird that knows your tune
then a little voice inside of you whispers
"kid, don't sell your dreams so soon "

everywhere you look, everywhere you go
there's a heart  there's a heart , a hand to hold onto
everywhere you look, everywhere you go
there's a face  there's a face  of somebody who needs you

whatever happened to the good old days?
talking to friends for hours, swore it'd never go away
now i'm feeling a little crazy, trying to fit in with a scene
cause how do you know where you're going, if you really don't know who you've been?

everybody eventually
says that they're as lost as you
so everybody shout it together
"hey, don't sell your dreams so soon "

everywhere you look, everywhere you go
there's a heart  there's a heart , a hand to hold onto
everywhere you look, everywhere you go
there's a face  there's a face  of somebody who needs you
everywhere you look, everywhere you go
there's a heart  there's a heart , a hand to hold onto
everywhere you look

when you're lost out there and you're all alone
a light is waiting to carry you home
everywhere you look


everywhere you look, everywhere you go
there's a heart  there's a heart , a hand to hold onto
everywhere you look, everywhere you go
there's a face  there's a face  of somebody who needs you
everywhere you look, yeah

when you're lost out there and you're all alone
a light is waiting to carry you home
everywhere you look
la la la la la la la
la la la la la la


when dreams grew black
i didn't want to see the light
crossed through hell in snow
dreams were gone and then yourself
taught me to know what it's like

don't shout it, stay
i don't want to let you down
plead your cause
i don't want to let you down
i don't want to let you down
i don't want to let you down

decompress
calm your head
teach you not to rush
turn my mouth to see your words
trust me, stay and stay

overboard
i don't want to let you down
overboard
i don't want to let you down
crazy hell
i don't want to let you down
i don't want to let you down
i don't want to let you down
i don't want to let you down
i don't want to let you down

missing you felt like pulling teeth
i taste the metal when you're next to me
it's so cold and sweet
it makes me wanna take it back
to the night when your car died
kissing in the rain on a summer night
it was warm and sweet
it makes me wanna take it back
kissing you felt like a lack of strength
the touch of your lips made my legs go weak
it was warm and sweet
it made me wanna take it back
to the night when it all began
i thought that fun was what i wanted then
something cold but sweet
i wish that i could get that back
wish that i could feel like that
wish that i could get it
but remember what it felt like
when you told me it was the last time
i'd be seeing you
missing you felt like i lack of rain
but i could be drowning if you'd say my name
it be warm and sweet
it'd make me wanna take it back
to the night when we last hung out
i knew that love was what i wanted now
but i got cold feet
i wish that i could take that back
wish that i could take you back
wish that i could take it
to the night where i first met you
i remember just how i left you
with i'd be seeing you
but remember what it felt like
when you told me it was the last time
i'd be seeing you


tar on the road held the heat of the day
craving the danger as on it we lay
clothes like cling fim on your back
caught in the swelter like it's a trap
dizzier then we're spiraling down
our time is all spent cause i'm spending it now
tar on the road held the heat of day
you're holding it in you say you're okay

and i believe you
cause nothing else could get much better
i believe you
feeling like we're at the equator
i see you
keeping to yourself

stepping right in to find out we were blind
our vision was drowned by a burning sky
caught in the daze you wore so well
the hotter it got the less that i felt
treading the line of the land in the sea
shivering as we got up to our knees
it's colder than we thought it'd be
further south than we'd ever been

but i need you
it's hard to make you not forget
that we need you
after all this time i'm starting to see you
convince me that you're fine

i can see your collarbones and baby i'm scared
never thought i'd be so unprepared


i live my day as if it was the last
live my day as if there was no past
doin' it all night, all summer
doin' it the way i wanna
yeah, i'ma dance my heart out 'til the dawn
but i won't be done when mornin' comes
doin' it all night, all summer
gonna spend it like no other

it was a crush
but i couldn't, couldn't get enough
it was a rush
but i gave it up
it was a crush
now, i might've went and said too much
but, that's all it was
so, i gave it up

i live my day as if it was the last

yeah, the sun won't set on us
ooh ooh ooh ooh, yeah, yeah

went low, went high
still waters run dry

i ain't ever worried
went low, went high, what matters is now
gettin' right back in the mood

i live my day as if it was the last
live my day as if there was no past
doin' it all night, all summer
doin' it the way i wanna
yeah, i'ma dance my heart out 'til the dawn
but i won't be done when mornin' comes

hold your horses
hold, hold the border
don't come closer
don't, don't let go of me
i'm like porcelain
when you're with me
all, all i know is

just about a million ways to harm you
all the things i shouldn't say
are the things that when i want to make you happy
only comes out of me

what if i dropped, dropped the steering wheel
closed my eyes
drove, drove faster
i'm like porcelain
when i love you
i, i know it's

just about a million ways to harm you
all the things i shouldn't say
are the things that when i want to make you happy
only comes out of me
we have got the power of destruction
you can always let it fall
but when we try to work on something solid
it is too goddamn hard

give it a thought, it takes a lot
to trust that someone else will catch my fall  i'm like porcelain 
it takes a lifetime, breaking goes fast
when everything that matters made of glass

just about a million ways to harm you
all the things i shouldn't say
are the things that when i want to make you happy
only comes out of me

two step in the cut
spotlights in the cut
chances are you never saw
what made you who you are
so take a bow cause it's done
your awful dreams are gone
and scars remain of running away
and hiding 'fore they come

see you want a place that's still
place to cure your ills
a place to save your face
and keep you calm when you're uphill
you'll never be the best
she'll never turn you on
and scars remain from running away
and hiding where you're from

don't lose my name
it makes me wonder
will i ever be enough?
don't call again
i couldn't answer
my deviation sets it off

choosing what you live for
it's never what you make your life
how could you know
if you're squandering your passion for another?
do you ever think, boy?
or does it just feel better alone?
feeling the comfort of sadness in a new set of surroundings

lose my name
call again

choosing what you live for
it's never what you make your life
how could you know

'cause i don't wanna keep it on the low, low, low, low, low, low
on the low
no, i don't wanna keep it on the low, low, low, low, low, low


through unrest and stillness
wasn't i your witness?
now there's a difference
a distance between us

i call your name
but you can't hear me
now something's changed
your back is to me
up against the wall
how did i fall so hard again?

like a wall falls in the night
but the rhythm's just out of time
there's a reason you're by my side again

it's nobody's business
who cares if anyone listens?
now there's a madness to this
and it's getting to us

i call your name
but you can't hear me
now something's changed
your back is to me
up against the wall
how did i fall so hard again?

and the wall falls in the night
but the answer's just out of sight
there's a reason you're holding me tight again

and i'll wait for the rest of our lives
with the answer just out of sight
there's a reason you're by my side
yeah, oh yeah

like a wall falls in the night
but the rhythm's just out of time
there's a reason you're by my side again
and the wall falls in the night
but the answer's just out sight
there's a reason you're holding me tight again


should we dissolve this?
it's not doing any favours

been my desire, my pleasure, my pain
never could see this coming
called it forever, we're caught in the game
or maybe we're both to blame
putting this under pressure

you wanna ride but keep on rocking the boat
soon it will tip us over
and there won t be another

there you go, there you go
you're saying all the things you want
now i know i can take it
now i see we are breaking down
don't say it to me
there i go, there i go
i'm doing all the things you want
now i don't think we'll make it
now we are close to dead and gone
i know now

just when i thought it had fallen to place
hit me with the destruction
fight it with fire, don't throw it away
you push me again and again and again
there's no surprises

i'll never forget that day
dark in your eyes, couldn't make what you're saying
you were caught on your mouth, that we're dissipating
easy come, heating up, temptation

there you go, there you go
you're saying all the things you want
now i know i can take it
now i see we are breaking down
don't say it to me
there i go, there i go
i'm doing all the things you want
now i don't think we'll make it
now we are close to dead and gone
i know now

should we dissolve this?
it's not doing any favours
don't let it get between us anymore


so i never really knew you
god i really tried to
blindsided, addicted
thought we could really do this
but really i was foolish
hindsight it's obvious

talking with my lawyer
she said where d you find this guy
i said young people fall in love
with the wrong people sometimes

some mistakes get made
that's alright, that's okay
you can think that you re in love
when you're really just in pain
some mistakes get made
that's alright, that's okay
in the end it's better for me
that's the moral of the story babe

it's funny how a memory
turns into a bad dream
when running wild turns volatile
remember how we painted our house
just like my grandparents did
so romantic but we fought the whole time
should've seen the signs yeah

talking with my mother
she said where d you find this guy
said some people fall in love
with the wrong people sometimes

some mistakes get made
that s alright, that's okay
you can think that you re in love
when you're really just in pain
some mistakes get made
that's alright, that's okay
in the end it s better for me
that's the moral of the story babe

they say it's better to have loved and lost
than never to have loved at all
that could be a load of shit
but i just need to tell you all

some mistakes get made
that's alright, that's okay
you can think that you're in love
when you're really just engaged
some mistakes get made
that's alright, that's okay
in the end it's better for me
that's the moral of the story
some mistakes get made
that's alright, that's okay
you can think that you're in love
when you're really just in pain
some mistakes get made
that's alright, that's okay
in the end it's better for me
that's the moral of the story babe
 that's the moral of the story 
 that's the moral of it 

she said "how did we get ourselves so lost?"
and i said "i don't know, but we will not be leaving tonight, tonight
when you hold me i, i feel better"
i only want one night, together in our arms
this is the longest night, we're meeting arms to arms

nothing is wasted and life is worth living
heaven is nowhere, just look to the stars
there is a day that is yours for embracing
everything's nothing, and nothing is ours
nothing is wasted and life is worth living
heaven is nowhere, just look to the stars
there is a day that is yours for embracing
everything's nothing, and nothing is ours
'and maybe if we'd never come this way
then we would live and prosper
but i doubt it
we are a violent race
and we deserve what we get
when you hold me, when you hold me
i feel better, i feel better'
i only want one night, together in our arms  i feel better 
this is the longest night, we're meeting arms to arms  i feel better 
i only want one night, together in our arms  i feel better 
this is the longest night, we're meeting arms to arms

nothing is wasted, a life is worth living

the tables, the pink bow
who they think they know
but i keep it a secret
even you don't think it shows

but i hope you notice
the way i lose my focus in your eyes
boy, i hope you notice
the darkness when i'm gone it won't subside

but it feel like...you want it bad
but you only want it sometime
how it feel like...you want it bad
but you only want it sometime
some fake like...

the long night, we talk out
until the sun is born
a fake like, i don't mind
when the other girl's around

but i hope you've noticed
the way i lose my focus in your eyes
boy, i hope you'll notice
the darkness when i'm gone it won't subside

but it feel like...you want it bad
but you only want it sometime
now i feel like...you want it bad
but you only want it sometime
oh, i feel like...
well, i feel like...
so, i think like...


it's been 7 hours and 15 days
since you took your love away
i go out every night and i sleep all day
since you took your love away
since you've been gone, i can do whatever i want
i can see whoever i choose
i can eat my dinner in a fancy restaurant
but nothing, i said nothing can take away these blues
'cause nothing compares, nothing compares to you

it's been so lonely without you here
like a bird without a song, ahh
nothing can stop these tears from falling down
tell me, baby, where did i go wrong?
i could put my arms around every boy i see
they only remind me of you
i went to the doctor, and guess what he told me
guess what he told me
he said, "girl, you better try to have some fun
no matter what you do," but he's a fool
'cause nothing compares, nothing compares to you
nothing compares, nothing compares to you
nothing compares, nothing compares to you

oh, oh, my love, my darling
i've hungered for your touch
a long, lonely time
and time goes by so slowly
and time can do so much
are you still mine?
i need your love, i need your love
godspeed your love to me
lonely rivers flow, rivers flow, rivers flow
to the sea, to the sea, to the sea, to the sea
to the open arms
of the sea, the sea, the sea, the sea
lonely rivers sigh, rivers sigh, rivers sigh
wait for me, wait for me, wait for me, wait for me
i'll be coming home, wait for me, my love

i've seen it all, i have seen the trees
i've seen the willow leaves dancing in the breeze
i've seen a man killed by his best friend
and lives that were over before they were spent
i've seen what i was   i know what i'll be
i've seen it all   there is no more to see 

you haven't seen elephants, kings or peru 
i'm happy to say i had better to do
what about china? have you seen the great wall?
all walls are great, if the roof doesn't fall 

and the man you will marry?
the home you will share?
to be honest, i really don't care...

you've never been to niagara falls?
i have seen water, it's water, that's all...
the eiffel tower, the empire state?
my pulse was as high on my very first date 
your grandson's hand as he plays with your hair?
to be honest, i really don't care...

i've seen it all, i've seen the dark
i've seen the brightness in one little spark
i've seen what i chose and i've seen what i need
and that is enough, to want more would be greed
i've seen what i was and i know what i'll be
i've seen it all   there is no more to see 

you've seen it all and all you have seen
you can always review on your own little screen
the light and the dark, the big and the small
just keep in mind   you need no more at all
you've seen what you were and know what you'll be
you've seen it all   there is no more to see 


and just when we discover that we need each other
here our lives keep pulling us away
now we're both so unstable at the kitchen table
with these peanut bagels in a foreign state

because the point is that i see it's not just me
the point is that you feel my company
i don't wanna say goodbye
guess i'll see you when the screen is vibrating

it's not just me
i know you're feeling the same way
and i can't fail to believe
when you're feeling the same way
it's not just me
i know you're feeling the same way
and i can't fail to believe
when you're feeling the same way
it's not just me

back then, i'd just decided i was so misguided
that you'd all forget about me, in time
bet you remember it was new year's eve
sparklers through palaced streets
we knew though years do change
we'd always feel the same

because the point is that i see it's not just me
the point is that you feel my company
you know i'll never be too far if you're looking for somebody
i'm here

it's not just me
i know you're feeling the same way
and i can't fail to believe
when you're feeling the same way
it's not just me
i know you're feeling the same way
and i can't fail to believe
when you're feeling the same way
it's not just me

it seems so hard you ll start to feel so
good to know sweeping it under the carpet
it seems so hard you'll start to feel so
good to know sweeping it under the carpet
and i know when you know

it's not just me
i know you're feeling the same way
and i can't fail to believe
when you're feeling the same way
it's not just me
i know you're feeling the same way
and i can't fail to believe
when you're feeling the same way
it's not just me


born with a scar far above my head
i count the stars crowding my vision
and i feel nothing instead
i feel nothing instead

soak in decay, spoil into loam
give what i take but it never feels enough
so, i give nothing instead
i give nothing instead

take me to the water
i am not free but i am sorry, i am stone
you should know i would never let you down
you should know i would never let you drown

loan by the skin, a vessel with two hands
touch what i can before i hand it in
so, i touch nothing instead
i touch nothing instead

born into debt, a line of no request
pay what i can but the rest, i have no chance
so, i pay nothing instead
i pay nothing instead

take me to the water
i am not free but i am sorry, i am stone
you should know i would never let you down
you should know i would never let you drown

take me to the water
let me soak in slaughter
i will sink into the bed like a stone
take me to the water
let me soak in slaughter
i will sink into the bed like a stone

take me to the water
i am not free but i am sorry, i am stone
you should know i would never let you down
you should know i would never let you down
you should know i would never let you down
you should know i would never let you drown


like a nail in the wood
build this house from nothing
now i stand where i've stood
welling up with something
i feel great, i feel good
what a long time coming
i forgot that i could
let someone fulfill me

how do you do it?
how do you do it?
how, how do you do it?
how do you do it?
how, how do you do it?
how do you do it?
how, how do you do it?
how do you do it?
how, how

do you do it?
like this? like that?
oh, how, when you do it
when you drive me mad
oh, how do you do it?
like this? like that?
oh, how, when you do it
when you drive me mad
oh, how

all my dreams take on shape
when you whisper my name
when your eyes tell my eyes
you've been wanting the same
to let go of your touch
would be too much for me
let the roots dig in deep
when you hold my body

how do you do it?
how do you do it?
how, how do you do it?
how do you do it?
how, how do you do it?
how do you do it?
how, how do you do it?

 oh, how 


you and i, we were always strong
it was enough to keep me on
believe me
and i woke up with my green eyes blue
and all i think about is you
and your fist

where did your love, where did your love grow cold?
the closer i get, the farther i have to go
to places we don't know
to places we don't know
to places we don't know
to places we don't know

in all this light, all i feel is dark
had the sun without its' warmth
i'm freezing

where did your love, where did your love grow cold?
the closer i get, the farther i have to go
to places we don't know
to places we don't know
to places we don't know
to places we don't know


you come to life
when all the people on the streets start to rise
and the sun, it starts to open up our eyes
we can make this moment stay with us for a while

you can count on it, i'm where you left me
i can count on you to show me the way
we can keep it light, we're going somewhere
i won't try to fight it, don't feel like it

in your skin, in your hair, i'm tangled up
in my head, in my mind, i can't get out
when you twist and you turn, teach me to run
i grab and hold on
i grab and hold on tight

you make it right
every moment that we spend without time
pain is something how we manage on the line
it's on us now to keep our route come hell, high water

you can count on it, i'm where you left me
i can count on you to show me the way
we can keep it light, we're going somewhere
i won't try to fight it, don't feel like it

in your skin, in your hair, i'm tangled up
in my head, in my mind, i can't get out
when you twist and you turn, teach me to run
i grab and hold on
i grab and hold on tight

know that it's you
the reason that i come alive, come alive
it lives in your eyes
you know that it's you
the reason that i come alive, come alive
you know that it's you
the reason that i come alive, come alive
it lives in your eyes
you know that it's you
the reason that i come alive, come alive

in my head, in my mind, i can't get out
when you twist and you turn, teach me to run
i grab and hold on
i grab and hold on tight

purple pavements
crooked fingers knocking on windows without souls
bodies are swinging from rooftops and poles
howling through hollows
restless nights and one night cheap hotels
oh, am i only drifting to always come back?
and i search for something
oh, whatever i don t really care
driving with their lights off they can be anywhere
rolling down their windows
open car with open mouths
golden teeth and golden cards
you cover your eyes
you cover your mouth
you cover your ears
still you follow my trail
i ll do it all, i ll do whatever you say
god has left me anyway
lava laiden pavements
stars with stains and the heaven and afterglow
beneath the ashes are echoes buried alive
they are howling through hollows
once we shared their temple of halls
now our heads are hung up on walls
we are ruins within ruins
on every corner a gladiator is begging for another century
when no one cut your tongue to know nothing and to know it all
to be both the animal and god
you cover your eyes
you cover your mouth
you cover your ears
still you follow our trail
we ll do it all, we ll do whatever you say
god has left us anyway
you cover your eyes
you cover your mouth
you cover your ears
still you follow our trail
we ll do it all, we ll do whatever you say
god has left us anyway
there are echoes in the garden is anybody listening
there are echoes lost in the garden is anybody listening
they whisper:
the ones who are only living are the ones who are only dying


you and i and nobody else
feeling feelings i've never felt
boy, it s the way you got me under your spell
don't you keep it all to yourself

so won't you take it?
i feel like for the first time i am not faking
fingers on my buttons and now you re playing

deep in the play
i see you as you are lookin' over
friends in my way
you never could've been a good lover

watch what you say
could never mean a word and still hurt you
look the other way
just tell me that i'm wrong
so wrong

i never was in love
you know that you were never good enough
fall asleep right next to me

ways and ways

fall asleep right next to me

i never was in love
you know that you were never good enough
fall asleep right next to me
you know that you were never good enough


look inside, look inside your tiny mind
then look a bit harder
'cause we're so uninspired, so sick and tired
of all the hatred you harbour
so you say it's not okay to be gay
well, i think you're just evil
you're just some racist who can't tie my laces
your point of view is medieval

fuck you  fuck you , fuck you very, very much
'cause we hate what you do

talk talk talk talk talk talk talk
that's what everybody and they mama wanna do
whomp whomp whomp
remote please, mute 
you can have your pennies and your two cent 'tude
 oh my god that's so messed up, how dare she say that in a song
anti fem, she's so wrong. i'm gonna post this on my blog 
take a hike  matter'o fact  jog
i've been running what took so long
i've been gunning for the top  boy stop  
i've been reviving this thing, ben taub
if you took it upon yourself to take your self so literal
you're missing on the minerals to liberate your inner liberal
generally i don't give a rat's patootie
but you pursued me
so here's my battle cry against those who slew me, who never knew me
 big girl, small world 

do i need to re remind you that you sipping from the c h a l i c e
and i'm doing all this for the w e?

getting dirt for the turf like a workaholic
but your worth cop a shirt 'cuz you work is na na
niggahs can't pay rent putting hustle in their mou mou
grasp for the raps for the stack when they can. do
slack, and i have to attack and offend you
smashing these tracks...and that's what i'm into

lookin like a girl cause i'm keeping it youthful
such a freakin lady, classy and beautiful
thinking like a man, for those who don't understand
is having two grips to gain the upper hand
if you had the courage to give me reprimand to my face
instead of slight of hand, you da man 
 my employees no i me 



toe to toe, dancing very close
barely breathing, almost comatose
wall to wall, people hypnotised
and they're stepping lightly
hang each night in rapture

back to back, sacroiliac
spineless movements and a wild attack
face to face, sadly solitude
and it's finger pop
it's 24 hour shopping in rapture

fab five freddie told me everybody fly
dj's spinning i said my oh my
flash is fast, flash is cool
francois sais pas, flashe no deux
and you don't stop, sure shot
you go out to the parking lot
and you get in your car and you drive real far
and you drive all night, then you see a light
and it comes right down and lands on the ground
and out comes a man from mars
and you try to run, but he's got a gun
and he shoots you dead and he eats your head
then you're in the man from mars
and you go out at night, eatin' cars
you eat cadillacs, lincolns, too, mercuries and subarus
and you don't stop, you keep on eatin' cars
then, when there's no more cars
you go out at night and you eat up bars
where the people meet face to face, dance cheek to cheek
one to one, man to man, dance toe to toe
don't move too slow, 'cause the man from mars
is through with cars, he's eatin' bars
yeah, wall to wall, door to door
hall to hall, he's gonna eat 'em all
rapture, be pure
take a tour, through the sewer
don't strain your brain, just paint a train
and you'll be singin' in the rain
i said, don't stop, do the punk rock
don't stop, do the punk rock
don't stop, do the punk rock
don't stop, do the punk rock
well now you see what you wanna be
just have your party on tv
'cause the man from mars won't eat up bars
when the, uh, when the tv's on
and now he's gone back up to space
where he won't have a hassle with the human race
and you hip hop, and you don't stop
just blast off, sure shot
'cause the man from mars stopped eatin' cars and eatin' bars
and he only eats guitars, get up
and he only eats guitars, get up
and he only eats guitars, get up

i woke up depressed as fuck
i wanna sit around and tell you how it sucks
how it's hard to walk with spaghetti legs
and a mind that s freaking out about the world we're in
i feel like quicksand, sucking me down to my last limb
i'm at the bottom of the ocean and i can t swim
i'm at the bottom of the ocean and i might just quit

i keep the tv on to drown out the sound
my mind is way too loud
my mind's way too loud
i keep the tv on to drown out the sound
my mind is way too loud
my mind's way too loud  shh 

they don't make 'em like
turn the tv off
but they ours to fight
boys with the, boys with the

went to bed feeling sick again
i try to stop the voices in my head
holding on tight while my room spins
take a deep breath as the fear sets in
i love distractions
taking my mind off of life 'cause
everything thing about it makes me anxious
every single day, i try to cope with it

i keep the tv on to drown out the sound
my mind is way too loud
my mind's way too loud
i keep the tv on to drown out the sound
my mind is way too loud
my mind s way too loud  shh 

they don t make 'em like
turn the tv off
but they ours to fight
boys with the, boys with the

i keep the tv on to drown out the sound
my mind is way too loud
my mind s way too loud
i keep the tv on to drown out the sound
my mind is way too loud
my mind's way too loud  shh 

they don't make 'em like
turn the tv off
but they ours to fight
boys with the, boys with the

i wake up every morning feeling like slapping a nigga
squeeze trigger, stay scheming then i realize i'm still dreaming
oops, psych  believing in believers ability to still scream for a nigga till you get nosebleeds
i be so scuffed up from kicking them rocks
and if you're so tough come run up and get clocked
tick tock tock tock
if you got them slippery socks
yo i'mma give it all that i got
to make a nigga slide in the vault
then bake a nigga dash in some salt
i bring a nigga home and pole vault
then blame a nigga like it's your fault
 you're fault  
i never understood and i will never understand
the tolerance for ho ishness that some of you people have
"me?" you, yeah you
i'm talking to the middle man
like how you're content with giving someone else the upper hand
walking around your cubicle, your tie with your coffee mug
syphoning the hard earned work from the thugs and hustlers, cuz
takin a chill pill before i whip my sword out like uma in kill bill
makin niggas gasp like emmitt till
and i'mma keep on giving you the gospel like god's will, peace  be still

this is god's will peace be still
can i fall in love before the world ends?
can my record get a few major spins? i'm saying
i don't wanna think about tomorrow because i'm still hustling
until then, i guess it's just me, you, theses food stamps and cravings
no raisins in the sun, just funyins and a sunkist, we up in the club making it mist
like a missed alcohol  though i see it every night 
and that tylenol i take everyday period like midil
bye y'all, i'm moving on to other things by y'all
but not quite bilateral, more like three floors up and down the hall
let the bygones be bygones, and try to keep the peace like obama and biden
all my friends are talented, all my friends got mad skills
all my girlfriends wear heels, all my niggas drug deal
we're tight  psych

 bang  
i can hear the shots, when the fireworks soar, and the sounds of the battle
 drop down  
drop down, know i'm on top; when the arrows are drawn, the sergeant's on the saddle
this ain't the type of love that sees a lot of give and take
and i don't know how we push and pull, but i know we'll never break
bang, bang, i can hear the shots
but i like the way you feel in the flames of the candle

too late to leave these walls
this castle's been surrounded
won't stay to watch it fall around us

bring the big guns out, shoot now
i'll make the drums beat harder for you
red on the ground, bleed out
i'll rub the colors on my face to prove
i'll sing it like
whoa oh, oh oh oh oh
watch me put my war paint on, my war paint on
whoa oh, oh oh oh oh
watch me put my war paint on, my war paint on

i move my troops on the map
when your allies and your tribes are telling you to leave me
they won't see my plan of attack
cause this is our fight; love is not the enemy
everything that you do gives me some power, makes me feel alive
so take the gun, i'm your bonnie, you can be my clyde
i know that you feel the same
so paint it on your face and, baby, let the world see

too late to leave these walls
this castle's been surrounded
won't stay to watch it fall around us

bring the big guns out, shoot now
i'll make the drums beat harder for you
red on the ground, bleed out
i'll rub the colors on my face to prove
i'll sing it like
whoa oh, oh oh oh oh
watch me put my war paint on, my war paint on
whoa oh, oh oh oh oh
watch me put my war paint on, my war paint on

it's not easy, but i'll draw my knife for you
it's not easy, but i'll draw my knife for you again

bring the big guns out, shoot now
i'll make the drums beat harder for you
red on the ground, bleed out
i'll rub the colors on my face to prove
i'll sing it like
whoa oh, oh oh oh oh
watch me put my war paint on, my war paint on
whoa oh, oh oh oh oh
watch me put my war paint on, my war paint on
whoa oh, oh oh oh oh
watch me put my war paint on, my war paint on
whoa oh, oh oh oh oh

on for you


our love's for real
how'd it take a long, long time
to let us feel?
try to relate in my state
and the aura around me says
my love is for real

touching your face
how'd it take a long, long time
to be here?
turning the wheel on my street
my heart still skips a beat
it's echoing, echoing, echoing, echoing, echoing, echoing

baby, baby, baby
i've been searching for you
i want to be in love
baby, baby, baby
i've been waiting, waiting, waiting my whole life
for someone like you
it's true that everyone would like to have met
a love so real
a love so real

baby, baby, baby
i've been searching for you
i want to be in love
baby, baby, baby
i've been waiting, waiting, waiting my whole life

it's true that everyone would like to have met
a love so real
a love so real

a love so real


i know it's nothing more than flutes
but something in my heart is loose
there's never been a better day
and if there is nothing more
then nothing more will add, i say
there's never been a better day

i put up on a string today
deciding never taught me a thing
a wooden box breathes the way
never again, never again
never again, never again

all this talk is getting me down
nothing's making sense in my brain
i m moving words across the terrain
trying hard to fix to the page
i m wedded to the thought that we came
only to discover our names
and blow a horn of love in refrain
and watch things drop down
and watch things drop down
and watch things drop down
and watch things drop down

work that inside, outside, work that more

you'll be given love
you'll be taken care of
you'll be given love
you have to trust it

maybe not from the sources
you have poured yours
maybe not from the directions
you are staring at

twist your head around
it's all around you
all is full of love
all around you

all is full of love
you just ain't receiving
all is full of love
your phone is off the hook
all is full of love
your doors are all shut
all is full of love

all is full of love, all is full of love
all is full of love, all is full of love
all is full of love
all is full of love, all is full of love

there's a valley of sorrow in my soul
where every night i hear the thunder roll
like the sound of a distant gun
over all the damage i have done
and the shadows filling up this land
are the ones i built with my own hand
there is no comfort from the cold
of this valley of sorrow in my soul
there's a river of darkness in my blood
and through every vein i feel the flood
i can find no bridge for me to cross
no way to bring back what is lost
into the night it soon will sweep
down where all my grievances i keep
but it won't wash away the years
or one single hard and bitter tear
and the rock of ages i have known
is a weariness down in the bone
i used to ride it like a rolling stone
now i just carry it alone
there's a highway risin' from my dreams
deep in the heart i know it gleams
for i have seen it stretching wide
clear across to the other side
beyond the river and the flood
and the valley where for so long i've stood
with the rock of ages in my bones
someday i know it will lead me home. oh, oh, oh...

different people have their different ways of living
i chose mine and it was unforgiving
someone gave me guidance, there was something in it
i put it into practice and i tried to live it
i'm self dividing and i have no limit
i can't fix it, it's not right
nothing feels good, it's not right

watching my world
make funny faces at its own reflection
 nothing feels good, it's not right 
so i'll follow my girl
'til i find myself a sense of direction
 nothing feels good, it's not right 

i found a subsidence but i overlooked it
someone gave me guidance and for once i took it
i put it in perspective and i see so clearly
i'm part of a collective, oh i nearly reached it
in the distance, caught the light
i can fix it, make it right

i'm singing at a funeral tomorrow
for a kid a year older than me
and i've been talking to his dad; it makes me so sad
when i think too much about it i can't breathe

and i have this dream where i'm screaming underwater
while my friends are all waving from the shore
and i don't need you to tell me what that means
i don't believe in that stuff anymore

jesus christ, i'm so blue all the time
and that's just how i feel
always have and i always will
i always have and always will

i have a friend i call
when i've bored myself to tears
and we talk until we think we might just kill ourselves
but then we laugh until it disappears

and last night i blacked out in my car
and i woke up in my childhood bed
wishing i was someone else, feeling sorry for myself
when i remembered someone's kid is dead

jesus christ, i'm so blue all the time
and that's just how i feel
always have and i always will
i always have and always will

and it's 4am, again
and i'm doing nothing
again


eyes lit
on sharp threats
from dark lips
the lights press
the soft skin
to rough hands


sssh, sssh
it's, oh, so quiet
sssh, sssh
it's oh, so still
sssh, sssh
you're all alone
sssh, sssh
and so peaceful until

you fall in love
zing boom
the sky up above
zing boom
is caving in
wow bam

you've never been so nuts about a guy
you want to laugh, you wanna cry
you cross your heart and hope to die

'til it's over, and then
sssh, sssh
it's nice and quiet
sssh, sssh
but soon again
sssh, sssh
starts another big riot

you blow a fuse
zing boom
the devil cuts loose
zing boom
so what's the use
wow bam
of falling in love?

it's, oh, so quiet
it's oh, so still
you're all alone
and so peaceful until

you ring the bell
bim bam
you shout and you yell
hi ho ho
you broke the spell

gee, this is swell, you almost have a fit
this guy is "gorge" and i got hit
there's no mistake, this is it

'til it's over and then
it's nice and quiet
sssh, sssh
but soon again
sssh, sssh
starts another big riot

you blow a fuse
zing boom
the devil cuts loose
zing boom
so what's the use
wow bam
of falling in love?

the sky caves in
the devil cuts loose
you blow, blow, blow, blow, blow your fuse
when you fall in love
sssh


dance, it's all i wanna do so won't you dance
i'm standing here with you, why won't you move?
i'll get inside your groove 'cos i'm on fire, fire, fire, fire
it hurts
when you get too close but, baby, it hurts
if love is really good, you just want more
even if it throws you to the fire, fire, fire, fire

all the lovers
that have gone before
they don't compare
to you
don't be frightened
just give me a little bit more
they don't compare
all the lovers

feel, can't you see there's so much here to feel?
deep inside your heart you know i'm real
can't you see that this is going higher, higher, higher, higher?

and i'll take you there

heard a shout and someone calling
strained in darkness
vapour, like a veil, hangs over
the city tonight

hanging there behind the trees
a blood red moon is watching
i was waiting for you
dread in my heart

where the wind sings by the river
laughing, broken
hair swept out into the water
ripples of black

run, you better run
you better run for your life

oh, it rips through the sky
oh, a light flickers on
jo, i know you would say
 don t wait for me now 

shiver while you re breathe in
hold on while you breathe loud
i see the dawn
shiver while you breathe in
hold on while i breath loud

filigree of time demeaning
sunset, spoken
where the wind sings by the river
ripples of black

days, you gotta run
you gotta run for your life
run, you better run
you better run for your life

days, you gotta run
you gotta run for your life
run, you better run
you better run for your life

days, you gotta run
you gotta run for your life
run, you better run
you better run for your life

oh, you live 'til you breathe
don t run with me
breathe your life while you wait
don t wait for me now


walking down parsons green, i can feel the cold
the leaves in the park are turning brown, i'm 22 years old
crazy that i was stood right here just five years ago
with the heat on my skin and a lover who's now someone i don't know

you don't see it when it's happening
happens over time
first you're laughing, then you're crying
then you can't decide

my life's uncertain and sometimes it's strange
but one thing i've learned is it won't stay the same
even in the darkness, i'll be okay
the sun will come up, the seasons will change
the sun will come up, the seasons will change
the sun will come up, the seasons will change

winter comes racing 'round, something about the air
the fire is on and the chimney smoke is tangled in my hair
crazy how much my life has changed in just a year
there's people i've met, people i've left
and some that didn't make it here

you don't see it when it's happening
happens over time
first you're laughing, then you're crying
then you can't decide

my life's uncertain and sometimes it's strange
but one thing i've learned is it won't stay the same
even in the darkness, i'll be okay
the sun will come up, the seasons will change
the sun will come up, the seasons will change
the sun will come up, the seasons will change
the sun will come up, the seasons will change
the sun will come up, the seasons will change
the sun will come up, the seasons will change
the sun will come up, the seasons will change

the sun will come up, the seasons will change
the sun will come up, the seasons will change


i'm in shambles since i blew my 16th candle
it's the little things that i can't handle
and we're still in july
call me or reach me 'cause i need samples
a newspapes with no more scandals
some loose change with no more vandals
can i get up out my mind?

and yeah, i know my world's burning down
where to run? who to call?
even though my world's burning down
i know i can get through the fall

'cause life must go on  go, go on 
one blink, then it's all gone
i said life must go on  go, go on 
even when you know it's all wrong
whether you're high, whether you're low
gotta keep on, be a part of the show
i said life must go on  go, go on 
go on, and you know i got you

in my mind, in the chemistry that i combine sits
a melody that's singing, "you're not fine"
but they can't hear me out
so i'm in a rapid conversation
to know if this is any normal sensation
the internet's saying i'm temptatious
and they can't hear me shout

and yeah, i know my world's burning down
where to run? who to call?
even though my world's burning down
i know i can get through the fall

'cause life must go on  go, go on 
one blink, then it's all gone
i said life must go on  go, go on 
even when you know it's all wrong
whether you're high, whether you're low
gotta keep on, be a part of the show
i said life must go on  go, go on 
go on, and you know i got you

everything keeps on changing and i'm caught in the middle
i just keep getting anxious, yeah, i'm caught in the middle
trouble turning these pages, yeah, i'm caught in the middle

'cause life must go on
one blink, then it's all gone
i said life must go on
even when you know it's all wrong
whether you're high, whether you're low
gotta keep on, be a part of the show
i said life must go on  yeah 
go on, and you know i got you
life must go on  life goes on 
one blink, then it's all gone  all gone 
i said life must go on  go on 
even when you know it's all wrong
so whether you're high, whether you're low
gotta keep on, be a part of the show
i said life must go on  life goes on 
go on, and you know i got you

whether you're high, whether you're low
gotta keep on, be a part of the show
i said life must go on
go on, and you know i got you


no, i can't handle
no, i can't handle it, no
no, i can't handle

let out the air and sink to the bottom
where all the weight is forgotten
no one can hear me down here
came down to calm down where i don't fear
somebody seeing my tears
i feel safer down here

but i'm sinking deeper
i'm sinking deeper
i'm sinking deeper
than i ever thought i would go

too many times that i've been
too proud to let it out
 when i feel it's too much to handle 
too many times that i've been
too proud to let it out

and then i start to get nervous
what if i never resurface?
no one can hear me down here
the pressure gets worse the further i fall
the dimmer the light, the lower i go
and i'm getting cold

but i'm sinking deeper
i'm sinking deeper
i'm sinking deeper
than i ever thought i would go

too many times that i've been
too proud to let it out
 when i feel it's too much to handle 
too many times that i've been
too proud to let it out

no, i can't handle
no, i can't handle it, no
no, i can't handle
can you hear me down here?
no, i can't handle
no, i can't handle it, no
i think i'm safer down here

too many times that i've been
too proud to let it out
 when i feel it's too much to handle 
too many times that i've been
too proud to let it out
too many times that i've been
too proud to let it out
 when i feel it's too much to handle 
too many times that i've been
too proud to let it out

how come knots always loosen?
guess i tie myself to the loose ends
but i push, i press
i lost my bets
and who knows if i'll get  em back?
how do kings lose their fortune?
isn't love based on devotion?
but i push, i press
got 25 statues on my chest
and who knows if i'll get  em off?
now all i got left is my pulse
all i got left is my pulse
trying to get it all back
'cause i gave away everything
everything gets lost
all i got left is my pulse
couldn't hear the voice of reason
pressure here, tie the rope, stop the bleeding
but i push, i press
got 25 statues on my chest
and who knows if i'll get 'em off?
now all i got left is my pulse
all i got left is my pulse
trying to get it all back
'cause i gave away everything
everything gets lost
all i got left is my pulse
'cause i gave away everything
everything gets lost
all i got left is my pulse


bodies, can't you see what everybody wants from you?

forgive the kids
for they don't know how to live
run the alleys, casually

cruel, cruel

bodies, can't you see what everybody wants from you?
if you could want that, too

they could take or leave you
so they took you and they left you
how could they be casually

cruel, cruel, oh hoh
cruel, cruel, oh hoh

bodies, can't you see what everybody wants from you?
if you could want that, too, then you'll be happy

you were the one waving flares in the air
so they could see you
and they were the zephyr blowing past you
blowing fastly so they can t see you

it's not bad that you can't fall asleep
it's not bad that you're scared of the dark
it's just something you're born with i guess

it's hurting me, i'm terrified
feel so alone the dark will swallow me ye ye ye ye yeah
as it spreads like a parasite

and as i lay here in my bed at night
the only thing that's truly mine
is my fear of falling asleep
and not waking up

to feel the sunshine on your face
'cause it will come to end
like a river dries without the rain
will you witness me in a pit of fire
a blazing light atop a golden spire
sing ohh
everything comes to an end
but i can live with that
but i can live with that

i bury my head in the sand
and go on acting like it's all gone to plan
and i feel the sweat dripping down my neck
pretend it hasn't happened
and it hasn't happened yet

and as i lay here in my bed at night
the only thing that's truly mine
is my fear of falling asleep
and not waking up

to feel the sunshine on your face
'cause it will come to end
like a river dries without the rain
will you witness me in a pit of fire
a blazing light atop a golden spire

you know that town outside a city
well, it's a town outside that town
it's probably the last place on this earth that you would want to be
but it's the best place to feel aground
fine and dandy, look what i did, don't want you 'round here
fine and dandy, oh, now, all the pearls that i'm wearin' feel so ridiculous
fine and dandy indeed
well, there's a place inside that town
that you've been to many times
and it's brought you in and fixed you up but this time i offer and you're out of luck
and it's the purest i have found
you're not fine and dandy, and look what i did, won't make it disappear
you're not fine and dandy, oh, now all the frills and the fine stuff feel so ridiculous
when you're, you're not fine and dandy

i guess we'll never get started
let's save the silence all night
no need for talking about it
sometimes, the quiet feels so right

high
over the north star
sleepless, so far
together, we are
high
trapped in the holiday affair
a new silence filled the air

i rest my head on your shoulder
there's nowhere else i'd rather be
right there, a little bit slower
feel free to roll another one for me
 roll another one for me 

high
over the north star
sleepless, so far
together, we are
high
trapped in the holiday affair
a new silence filled the air

making way, we sway, we slide, oh
one flight to space, soothing you
it's too good to be true, have more on a rooftop view
making way, we sway, we slide, oh

high
over the north star
sleepless, so far
together, we are
high
trapped in the holiday affair
a new silence filled the air

high

your lips, warm and fuzzy
i want to run my fingers up your pussy


it's getting late, you really hate it
when i go home too soon, so you change my mind

'cause you complicate the mess when you spend the night
i'm not a crush, don't glamourize it
'cause we're getting over our heads, fucking with our minds

underneath these blood and bones

for the last time you will kiss my lips
now shut up and let me go
your jeans were once so clean
i bet you've changed your wardrobe since we met

now oh so easily you're over me
gone is love
it's you that ought to be holding me
i'm not containable
this time love is not sustainable

i ain't freakin', i ain't fakin' this
i ain't freakin', i ain't fakin' this
i ain't freakin', i ain't fakin' this
shut up and let me go
hey 

shut up and let me go
this hurts, what i can't show
for the last time you have me in bits
now shut up and let me go
for fear of living in regret
i've changed since from when we first met

now oh so easily you're over me
gone is love
it's me that ought to be moving on
you're not adorable
i want something un ignorable

i ain't freakin', i ain't fakin' this
i ain't freakin', i ain't fakin' this

for the last time you will kiss my lips
now shut up and let me go
hey 


i went with you up to
the place you grew up in
we spent a week in the cold
just long enough to
"walden" it with you
any longer, it would have got old
singing "ace of spades" when lemmy died
but nothing's changed, l.a.'s all right
sleeping in my bed again, and getting in my head
and then walk around the reservoir

you, you must have been looking for me
sending smoke signals
pelicans circling
burning trash out on the beach

one of your eyes is
always half shut
something happened when you were a kid
i didn't know you then
and i'll never understand
why it feels like i did
"how soon is now" in an '80s sedan
you slept inside of it because your dad
lived in a campground in the back of a van
you said that song will creep you out until you're dead

and you must have been looking for me
sending smoke signals
pelicans circling
burning trash out on the beach

i want to live at
the holiday inn
where somebody else makes the bed
we'll watch tv while
the lights on the street
put all the stars to death
it's been on my mind since bowie died
just checking out to hide from life
and all of our problems, i'm gonna solve 'em
with you riding shot gun, speeding, 'cause fuck the cops

and you, you must have been looking for me
sending smoke signals
pelicans circling
burning trash out on the beach

i buried a hatchet
it's coming up lavender
the future's unwritten
the past is a corridor
i'm at the exit looking back through the hall
you are anonymous
i am a concrete wall


are we to speak, first day of the week
stumbling words at the bar
beauty blue eyes, my order of fries
long island kindness and wine
beloved of john, i get it all wrong
i read you for some kind of poem
covered in lines, the fossils i find
have they no life of their own?

so can we pretend, sweetly
before the mystery ends?
i am a man with a heart that offends
with its lonely and greedy demands
there s only a shadow of me; in a matter of speaking, i'm dead

such a waste, your beautiful face
stumbling carpet arise
go follow your gem, your white feathered friend
icarus, point to the sun
if history speaks of two baby teeth
i m painting the hills blue and red
they said beware, lord, hear my prayer
i ve wasted my throes on your head

so can we be friends, sweetly
before the mystery ends?
i love you more than the world can contain
in its lonely and ramshackle head
there s only a shadow of me; in a matter of speaking, i'm dead

i m holding my breath
my tongue on your chest
what can be said of my heart?
if history speaks, the kiss on my cheek
where there remains but a mark
beloved, my john, so i ll carry on
counting my cards down to one
and when i am dead, come visit my bed
my fossil is bright in the sun

so can we contend, peacefully
before my history ends?
jesus i need you, be near me, come shield me
from fossils that fall on my head
there s only a shadow of me; in a matter of speaking, i'm dead


somehow we've always been together
but never got together
i never felt the pressure 'til now
there's something in the air
i'm here and you're just there
i can't pretend that i don't care

yeah, one day i might get it right
am i ready for tonight?
yeah, caution, caution, amber lights
still can't get you off my mind

don't know how, i don't know where
but we're becoming more than friends
getting closer to the edge
stop me from falling
shoulda seen the warning sign

kinda wanna cross the line
stop me from falling

for you

stop me from falling
for you

one risk from lying on your shoulder
when i was feeling colder
and now i can't get over
one kiss, a dangerous situation
i'm lost in hesitation
my heart's a little shaken

yeah, one day i might get it right
am i ready for tonight?
yeah, caution, caution, amber lights
still can't get you off my mind

i saw you in a dream
you had stayed the same
you were beckoning me
said that i had changed
tried to keep my eyes closed
i want you so bad
then i awoke and it was so sad

haven't talked to you in months
and i thought that i might cry
but i'm not that kind of girl

i saw you in a dream
you came to me
you were the sweetest apparition, such a pretty vision
there was no reason, no explanation
the perfect hallucination

all good things come to an end
but i thought that this might last
but you came and left so fast

and when i'm awake i can't switch off
it isn't the same but it is enough
 it isn't the same but it is enough 

i saw you in a dream
then it came to an end
i wonder if you'll come and visit me again
you're taking your time to reappear
i'm starting to believe that when i call your name

you just don't hear me anymore
and i know that i shouldn't even try
it's a waste of time

and when i'm awake i can't switch off
it isn't the same but it is enough
 it isn't the same but it is enough 
and when i'm awake i can't switch off
it isn't the same but it is enough
it isn't the same but it is enough


the desk where you sit inside of a frame
made of, made of, of wood
i keep those chopsticks you had from when you
taught abroad, taught abroad in japan

i love it all
so much i call
i want you back, back, back
you back

i did not know you
as well as my father, father knew you
every question you took the time to sit and
look it up, look it up in the encyclopedia

i love it all
so much i call
i want you back, back, back
you back
i love it all
so much i call
i want you back, back, back
you back

it sounds like we would have had a great deal
to say, to say to each other
i bet when i leave my body for the sky
the wait, the wait will be worth it

i love it all
so much i call
i want you back, back, back
you back
i love it all
so much i call
i want you back, back, back

how'd it take a long, long time
to let us feel?
try to relate in my state
and the aura around me says
my love is for real

touching your face
how'd it take a long, long time
to be here?
turning the wheel on my street
my heart still skips a beat

i used to shut my door while my mother screamed in the kitchen
i'd turn the music up, get high and try not to listen
to every little fight 'cause neither one was right

i swore i'd never be like them
but i was just a kid back then

the older i get, the more that i see
my parents aren't heroes, they're just like me
and loving is hard, it don't always work
you just try your best not to get hurt
i used to be mad, but now i know
sometimes it's better to let someone go
it just hadn't hit me yet
the older i get

i used to wonder why, why they could never be happy
i used to close my eyes and pray for a whole 'nother family
where everything was fine, one that felt like mine

i swore i'd never be like them
but i was just a kid back then

the older i get, the more that i see
my parents aren't heroes, they're just like me

and i know
times like these, you just take it slow
fall asleep in the pillows
she got my heart in a chokehold
and there she goes
heart that pounds like a stereo
you take me round and round like the merry go
but one more ride, baby, here we go

wake up to the sound of the creaking floors
just as familiar as the cracks in your palm
and i wanna be in this moment with you
but i'm restless here, i got these dreams and i can't seem to shake 'em

is there something more, is there something better?
and will i find it if i leave you behind?
at 20 something, feels like losing forever
and i'm too scared to close my eyes

when we were young, we had nothing to lose
my world was small, you were all i ever knew
but i'm afraid of missing out and blaming it on you
and i'm afraid of what i have to do

is there something more, is there something better?
and will i find it if i leave you behind?
at 20 something, feels like losing forever
and i'm too scared to close my eyes

i spin round and around in my head
between what i got and what i can get
you don't deserve to be here on the line

is there something more, is there something better?
and will i find it if i leave you behind?
at 20 something, feels like losing forever
and i'm too scared to close my eyes


do what you want
do what you wanna
do what you wanna
do what you wanna

when i look at you the drums all start beating
and i just don't know if i'm ready or not to do it all again

see, i got a wild heart and i can't control it
it keeps on letting me down

i know, with you, tonight could be amazing
be amazing
i'm scared to death
still, i'm stood here waiting
here waiting

do what you want
 do what you wanna 
take a hold of me
 do what you wanna 
'cause my heart keeps saying
 do what you wanna 
that you're all i need
 do what you wanna 

with a touch, you bring me back to life
i'm rising
and i don't even know if i'll survive, but i'm all in

see, i got a wild heart and i can't control it
it keeps on letting me down

i know, with you tonight could be amazing, be amazing
i'm scared to death
still, i'm stood here waiting, here waiting

do what you want
 do what you wanna 
take a hold of me
 do what you wanna 
'cause my heart keeps saying
 do what you wanna 
that you're all i need
 do what you wanna 

should be running away tonight
should be finding a place to hide
but i'm starting to feel alive
i know, with you, tonight could be, oh
should be running away tonight
should be finding a place to hide
but i'm starting to feel alive
i know, with you, tonight could be, oh

i know, with you, tonight could be amazing
be amazing
i'm scared to death
still, i'm stood here waiting
here waiting

do what you want
 do what you wanna, oh, my heart keeps telling me 
take a hold of me
 do what you wanna, oh, my heart keeps telling me 
'cause my heart keeps saying
 do what you wanna, oh, my heart keeps telling me 
that you're all i need
 do what you wanna

take a hold of me
 do what you wanna, oh, my heart keeps saying now 
'cause my heart keeps saying
 do what you wanna, oh, my heart keeps saying now 
that you're all i need
 do what you wanna, oh, my heart keeps saying now 


i could live in the world just like a stranger
i could tell you the truth or a lie
i could tell you that people are good in the end
but why, why would i?
angels will cry when it's raining
tears that are no longer clean
what do you mean?
what do you mean, it's all gone?
i've waited here so long

the minds of the people
have withered to nothing
know that you re missing something
you wanna leave the world with me
you wanna leave


i never let
my guard go down
but you messed me up
when you came around
when the high wore off
know you needed space
but i don't wanna wait
i don't wanna mistake

few thousand miles, and an ocean away
but i see the sunrise, just like the other day
picture your eyes as i fall asleep
tell myself it's alright
as the tears roll by

oh, oh, oh
i wish i could feel your face
oh, oh, oh
i'm helpless when i'm oceans away

i never felt
a room so still
see the future coming
hope it isn't real
i learned to fake a smile
as the time runs out
i don't wanna wait
oh, i don't wanna mistake

few thousand miles and an ocean away
but i see the sunrise, just like the other day
picture your eyes as i fall asleep
tell myself it's alright, as the tears roll by

oh, oh, oh
i wish i could feel your face
oh, oh, oh
i'm helpless when i'm oceans away
oh, oh, oh
i wish i could feel your face
oh, oh, oh
i'm helpless when i'm oceans away
helpless when i'm oceans away
i'm helpless when i'm oceans away

oh, oh, oh
i wish i could feel your face
oh, oh, oh
i'm helpless when i'm oceans away

sitting in depression
always calling me irreverent
if i prayed the weight would lessen
but your mouth can do it better
than some god who don't speak
fucking up my language
mixing words but never fading
if you stay you'll say you saved me
you can take it all away
when you leave i'll feel the same, hey

i don't mind you leaving when the damage is done
and i don't mind, i feel the same when you're gone

'cause what you lost, what you lost
i don't wanna be here anymore, anymore
there's no difference here from when you're gone, when you're gone
i'm not crawling on my knees to keep you here
'cause what you lost, what you lost
i don't wanna be here anymore, anymore
there's no difference here from when you're gone, when you're gone
i'm not crawling on my knees to keep you here

baby take me back to new york city
where the stars don't ever see me
i can hide under the scenery of a saturated sky
share some conjugated meaning
watch the light drip down your face
and when you'll leave i'll feel the same, ohh

i don't mind you leaving when the damage is done
and i don't mind, i feel the same when you're gone


'cause what you lost, what you lost
i don't wanna be here anymore, anymore
there's no difference here from when you're gone, when you're gone
i'm not crawling on my knees to keep you here

11 blocks from my door to your doorstep
three years later and it feels too close
i thought i broke the last of that breakdown
the morning i sold your winter coat
it doesn't feel right when i'm grabbing a coffee
the same old spot, but i'm on my own
i feel ok in the day, but at nighttime
you know how i get when i'm alone

cause my mind won't stop; it's just 11 blocks
i know that you're home
cause it's friday night; you're not that type
i know that you're home

14 blocks from your door to this party
i caught myself counting on the way
and right when i stepped in the door to the party
i stepped outside to grab a smoke
you know how i get when i'm alone, no

cause my mind won't stop; it's just 14 blocks
i know that you're home
cause it's friday night; you're not that type
i know that you're home
someone stop me, please, from hurting myself
cause i'm two blocks away and you're hurting my health
and it's friday night; you're not that type
i know that you're home

somebody stop me
i should be going home
somebody stop me
oh, yeah, yeah, yeah

well, i met someone
and i think i'm in love

but my mind won't stop; it's just 11 blocks
i know that you're home
cause it's friday night; you're not that type
i know that you're home
and, i met someone and i swear i'm in love
but i'm two blocks away and you're just like a drug
my mind won't stop; it's just 11 blocks
i know that you're home

i got somebody
waiting for me at home
i got somebody
oh, yeah, yeah, yeah

11 blocks from my door to your doorstep
three years later and it feels too close


you could be here, but you're there
you could be anywhere
and these days i don't even care no more
you only be showing me love whenever you've had too much
whatever's been filling your cup, no more

baby, no more showing up when you're not sober
at my front door just to say you're alone tonight
yeah, tryna fuck me and my mind up
it's a reminder you're a liar, and you know i'm right

you say you can't live without me
so why aren't you dead yet?
why you still breathing?
and you say you can't live without me
then why aren't you dead yet?
why do you say that?

you could be here, but you're not
i give whatever you want, but you just take it and run
you run  oh run, run 
and i give you so many shots, but you just drinking 'em all
you never give it a thought, oh love  yeah

cause i'm not just anybody
my love won't be taken down by a bullet
and i've tried everything
but i'm best at disappearing
and your love
used to bring out the best in me
and now i'd be dying
and now i'm reminded
left to remind me
that you, you're too cool to fall in love
you're too smooth to get caught up
in something you can't walk away from
don't walk away from me
and i know it's safer to believe
that you don't mean a thing to me
but, mmm hmm
i'm a fool i'm a fool and i'm in love
i'm a fool and i'm caught up
and i can't
can't walk away from you
can't walk away from you
so save what you're going to say to me
and i'll remember
and i'll meet you in the low tide, low tide
i'll meet you in the low tide, low tide
and i'll meet you in the low tide, low tide
gonna meet you in the low tide, low tide

you took the yellow diamonds biz and turned it on its head
everybody wants to turn up; give it to them
shock through attention, shock through attention
you put a lasso on the scene
feeds and pages; feeds and pages
look away, take the back door to

the heart of me
because i can't believe
that anything's cool anymore

i want to touch you; i want you to touch me
i can't stop this hurtful shit from happening
you and i, we've been through it
and this is not our way
dip into the lake, the mountains shake
the fear of god into

the heart of me
because i can't believe
that anything's cool anymore

i remember standing in a cathedral
somewhere in northern europe; i think it was paradiso
 i luv u brierley 
the space around my head was ringing
i felt like i finally touched this world
i felt as if i finally understood
that we had to do something of our own now
even if i didn't know it at the time
i couldn't take it anymore

the heart of me
because i can't believe
to the heart of me
because i can't believe
that anything's cool anymore


i think i need attention, i think i need your touch
don't have to say a word 'cause you know what i'm thinking of
fall into these waves, wake up in this haze
know you feel this connection, i taste it on your lips
my body's calling as you chase it with your fingertips
crash until we break, take your breath away

looking at the recess
this pressure, the way you look at
me, me, me, me

they say don t even try to resist
look at what you've been given
be grateful and don t take the piss
when the people on tv
they all look the same

no longer withheld by what you think of me

they say don t even try to resist
look at what you've been given
be grateful and don t take the piss
when the people on tv
they all look the same
i know i can do

oh my god, i'm gonna die
i don't wanna die, wanna stay alive

ain't too fun, this planet
everything that's on it
mass produced, overloaded, nothing interesting about it
see them models looking pretty, oh
the similarity is uncanny, doppelg ngers?
shit is serious like birds of a feather
we should flock together, shoot some hoops and all that
talking 'bout this and that, "are you real?" "are you fake?"
well i don't give a fuck, everybody's serious

why is everything so damn uninteresting?
just a little spice is all i need, baby
guess nobody likes to be too ordinary
extraordinary

same old story, going out of fashion
this is no flavor syndrome, ya

this is an age of information where everyone's cursed
living under a spell

lies all over twitter
self appointed heroes
everybody's mission: "find the villian of the day"
who shall we prey on tonight? your turn
who's the target tomorrow? who is it?
everything is the same, cookie cutter quality  niki, niki 
not for me, not for me  pichi, pichi 
i'ma shine, just for me  kira, kira 

everybody's slowly losing their momentum
afraid of people judging, afraid of being lonely
everyone's the same but everybody's different
guess we're all 'unique' now

i'm so beat, so tired of this obsession
same old story, going out of fashion
this is no flavor syndrome, ya
give me something better, something stronger, hey

wake up the white lights are calling
the weight of the world is pressing down
watch out, the skyline has fallen
transmission is lost into the crowd
for so long i've been hoping
one day we can run away
your wild eyes have got lost forever
but just know i'll find you anyway

i've been waiting so long
i was holding out
up in the dark, up in the echo park
with broken glass in my hand
we've been bleeding out
waiting for the night
waiting  for the night to start

till we are one
so we just stare into the sun
cold like the metal of a gun
never know, never know until we run
till we are one

lost now, i've been searching
washed out along the city lights
each day the signal is stronger
so i know that there's still a fight

i've been waiting so long
i was holding out
up in the dark, up in the echo park
with broken glass in my hand
we've been bleeding out
waiting for the night

till we are one

speak to me now
when i m asleep and there s nobody to depend on me
hold out your hand
'cause i ve been drifting and sometimes i need some sympathy

i tried to be what they want
i lost myself, i lost my feet, i lost my memories
now in silence i wait
i need your touch, i need your face, i need you

'cause i m searching for a night light in the dark
a brighter love, a brighter love
and i m searching for the undiluted heart
a brighter love, a brighter love

so now it s all come to this
what was the purpose?
i assumed that everything would pass
i gave myself to the night
i walked alone, i fell asleep on empty streets

now i see that
all this time my eyes were open
and all this time i didn t close them
and the headlights play upon the ocean
i will stay this way
'cause i see you, i see you now

i m searching for a night light in the dark
a brighter love, a brighter love
i m searching for the undiluted heart
a brighter love, a brighter love
i m hoping that somehow i ll find my way
to a brighter love, a brighter love
keep hoping 'til the night straight falls apart
a brighter love, a brighter love

my baby is a freak like me and she knows just what i like
she carries all the keys to the places that no one dares to find
she won't tell nobody what goes on in these walls
if they talked, they'd probably tell you all about love

my queen got machine gun hips, better duck once they go off
takes aim, no intentions to miss, oh my, so help us all
and it's close to a flight in the midst of neon lights
and my neighbors, they greet me with bags under their eyes
and they know why

my baby is a freak like me and she knows just what i like
she carries all the keys to the places that no one dares to find
she won't tell nobody what goes on in these walls
if they talked, they'd probably tell you all about love

oh, concubine, what are you made of?
no resource on this earth is that soft
i swear by god you are an angel
ironic how you help me raise hell

i let it go, surrender control
as she takes me for a ride
hands in the air, we offer our souls
it's easy when she's on my mind



i was only wanting
hour on the phone like
till your reasons start to shift
really think you could give yourself away
half a moments living in the sunset of our youth
kill the world wasn't enough to turn us loose
you never notice when my breathing gets loud
but give yourself a break

another sunlight in your eyes
and now they remind me of
nothing ever made it right

painting it powder blue
like the reflections in your room
we can just take a day
acting around on top of you

time there was a cracked wrist
honouring intentions
dancing in the pouring rain
you don't deserve to miss every chance you get
i discovered that you wouldn't like to give up
it makes me wonder if you'd ever give me trust
i heard you think i'm not the quickest catch
but you know we've got it made

it's just a lover's bid to lose
one o' clock after noon
to follow all the paths you choose

painting it powder blue
like the reflections in your room
we can just take a day
acting around on top of you
counting the time of dream
love's an illusion hard to keep
spinning the dark
to make it all fall back in peace

you tread them through like it's just another day
 i'll take your word for it 
he'll treat the weeks like they're for free
you soften your voice
i know exactly what i'm supposed to do
to look all the boys, i could say anything i wanted to

it's just a lover's bid to lose
one o' clock after noon
to follow all the paths you choose

painting it powder blue
like the reflections in your room
we can just take a day
acting around on top of you
counting the time of dream
love's an illusion hard to keep
spinning the dark
to make it all fall back in peace


i know i'm a mess, i didn't choose it  i didn't choose it 
i know you're scared i'm gonna lose it  i'm gonna lose it 
and now i'm just waiting for someone to take me
and tell me that i'm doing fine
'cause you won't fuck off of my mind
 'cause you won't fuck off of my mind 

i'm sorry and i hate the old me
i don't know how not to be lonely
i didn't believe that
loving was easy
i'm sorry for all of my phases
but you're giving me all your patience
and i'm never leaving
and you are the reason
you are the reason
you are the reason

i know i'm lost, i couldn't fake it  i couldn't fake it 
it's all too much for you to take, yeah  for you to take, yeah 
and now i'm just waiting for someone to take me
and tell me that we'll be alright
'cause you won't fuck off of my mind

i didn't believe that
loving was easy
i'm sorry for all of my phases
but you're giving me all your patience
and i'm never leaving
and you are the reason


drama in my life on purpose
'cause i don t need to have purpose
throw it all away to make ends
fucking up my night to keep friends
you look hella broke in the comments
so i don't need to have comments on how you feel

i did it all for the no
i did it all for the no good reasons
i said it all for the need
i always knew you would change like seasons

oh, got a canary on the roadside
haters would say that they can't find me
too many people in my rider
i take another pill and i m on a
height as a blimp in the projects
i don't need to be modest in how i feel, oh

i ain't never broke but if i'm broke, don't fix me
'cause i don't need a halfway entry
i'm going solo and i m moving slowly
all i care is how i feel
i can t wait to be honest
in what's real

i did it all for the no
broke it all for the no good reasons
i said it all for the no
did it all for the need
i did it all for the no
said it all for the need, yeah
i broke it all for the no
i did it all for the need, yeah

i did it all for the no
i said it all for the need

call it all for nothing
but i'd rather be nothing to you
than be a part of something
of something that i didn't do

 do you really want to? 
i can't be the only one
 did he even notice? 
who can be the best to you, be the best to you
 do you really want to? 
i can't be the only one
 did he even notice? 
who can be the best to you, be the best to you

part of me is faking
faking it all just for fun
part of me is breaking
breaking apart when you come

 do you really want to? 
i can't be the only one
 did he even notice? 
who can be the best to you, be the best to you
 do you really want to? 
i can't be the only one
 did he even notice? 
who can be the best to you, be the best to you

i feel my bones, i feel my bones, i feel my bones crack in your arms
and i can tell you what you want but i tell you all the things i like
and if i keep myself away, would you chase in the dead of night?
and i can't be the girl you want but i can be the thing you
throw away, throw away, throw away
throw away, throw away, you throw away
throw away, throw away, throw away
throw away, throw away, you throw away

 do you really want to? 
i can be the only one
 did he even notice? 
i can be the best to you, be the best to you
 do you really want to? 
i can be the only one
 did he even notice? 
i can be the best to you, be the best to you


don't cross your arms away from me
i think we should talk, i think you should leave
you've got a face that makes me feel cold
i've got a place where we can lay low

i prefer better though i prefer you
i used to be sweeter but i prefer you
i prefer better though i prefer you
i prefer, i prefer you

you've gotta be meaner if you mean it this time
with a ruthless mouth and a vicious mind
maybe i'm bored or maybe it's you
it might be good if we could be two

i prefer better though i prefer you
i used to be sweeter but i prefer you
i prefer better though i prefer you
i prefer, i prefer you
low, low, low, low
low, low, low, low


i prefer better though i prefer you
i used to be sweeter but i prefer you
i prefer better though i prefer you
i prefer, i prefer you
low, low, low, low
low, low, low, low

gleaming
wrapped in golden leaves

skin sewn on in sheets
casing the barracks
for an ass to break and harness into the fold

no family is safe
when i sashay


i've had good times
with some bad guys
i've told whole lies
with a half smile

pouring my purse in the dirt

but i i i i i don't wanna be your cheerleader no more

get a little closer, let fold
cut open my sternum, and pull
my little ribs around you
the rungs of me be under, under you

i'll cut the soft pockets, let bleed
over the rocky cliffs that you leave
to peer over and not forget what feet are
splitting threads of thunder over me

that i might see with my chest and sink
into the edges round you
into the lakes and quarries that brink
on all the edges round you, round you, round you

get a little closer, let fold
cut open my sternum, and pull
my little ribs around you
the lungs of me be crowns over you
get a little closer, let fold
cut open my sternum, and pull
my little ribs around you
the rungs of me be under, under you

i'll cut the soft pockets, let bleed
over the rocky cliffs that you leave
to peer over and not forget what feet are
splitting threads of thunder over me
listen closely, closely to the floor
emitting all its graces through the pores
you make a fine shrine in me
you build a fine shrine in me

that i might see with my chest and sink
into the edges round you
into the lakes and quarries that brink
on all the edges round you, round you, round you

get a little closer, let fold
cut open my sternum, and pull
my little ribs around you
the lungs of me be crowns over you
get a little closer, let fold
cut open my sternum, and pull
my little ribs around you
the rungs of me be under, under you


i threw a wish in the well
don't ask me, i'll never tell
i looked to you as it fell
and now you're in my way
i trade my soul for a wish
pennies and dimes for a kiss
i wasn't looking for this
but now you're in my way

your stare was holding
ripped jeans, skin was showing
hot night, wind was blowing
where you think you're going, baby?

i took no time with the fall
you gave me nothing at all
but still you're in my way
i beg and borrow and steal
at first sight and it's real
i didn't know i would feel it
but it's in my way

with a secret ingredient
and you are infinitely invited

two of them and four of eyes
and you are infinitely invited

 no one could not agree 
it's unanimously decided
 they've come for you and me 
that we are dangerously surrounded
 their boats are full of flames 
ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
 they paint the grasses green 
ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
 repeating history 
ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
 they don't say what they mean

silver hours, silver hours
becoming a habit?
 chasing the rabbit

 there's a system of symbols that no one will vouch for 
 everyone uses and no one believes 
 there's a dog in the yard with a manner that's rough 
 yet there's something about you that he understands 
 the girl at the window covered in ashes 
 smiles grotesquely in the light of the day 
 singing in german, the cold summer warning 
 but i can't remember what i meant to say 

is it amanaemonesia?
 mistaken for magic

to make somebody listen to you?

i always find the most creative ways to destroy myself
yeah, i can tear me down better than anybody else
i don't need your help, i don't need your help
you've been pouring gasoline in your living room
light a cigarette while you complain about the fumes
who are you to talk?
who are you to talk?
who are you to talk?

you're so shook when i catch on fire
so surprised when i have an answer
guess no one told you, now i told you
we're not living in the forties
ain't it weird when i'm thinking stuff?

oh, come on, just say something
no, go ahead, tell me, what do i need?
i'm not the kind of girl you undo
i'm not the kind of girl you undo
oh, come on, oh, come on
i've been undone long before you

you can't tie your favourite noose around my neck
cut me down when i turn blue and act like i'm the wreck
i don't need your help
i don't need your help
i don't need your help

you're so shook when i look right past you
so surprised you don't get an answer

we're not living in the forties
ain't it weird to feel small 'n stuff?

i should know better by now
but it's twenty to two and you know that i want some
should be drinking 'em down
but he poisoned my mind any time that i'm on one

every tomorrow i wake up and pray it's the day
that i won't miss it or want it or need him to stay
but he's already on his way
you know the worse they are, the better they taste

all my cravings come at night
this ain't love, it's sacrifice
oh my god, i can't behave
the worse they are, the better they taste

i got a big appetite
if i look then i touch then it's already over
i wish i could just take a bite
so i do, i don't think i can sink any lower

every tomorrow, i wake up and pray i won't be
'caught in the sugar, your sour, your salty, your sweet
i'm starving, so give it to me
you know the worse they are, the better they'll be

all my cravings come at night
this ain't love, it's sacrifice
oh my god, i can't behave
the worse they are, the better they taste

one little bite couldn't hurt, right?
i'ma get what i deserve, right?
i'm done with playing it safe
you know the worse they are, the better they taste

all my cravings come at night
this ain't love, it's sacrifice
oh my god, i can't behave
the worse they are the better they taste

one little bite couldn't hurt, right?
i'ma get what i deserve, right?
i'm done with playing it safe

wonder if the ground beneath our bodies is the same we once adored
we're passing on our stories like we're losing all our breath for something more
learn from my mistakes and take your patience with you when you fight the war
'cause maybe we weren't meant to keep ourselves awake until we know what for

leave me in my own skin in which i was, in which i was born
in the wind, predestined, gone before the oceans wash ashore
don't you feel it, darlin', when you sleep?
'cause i'm not stopping 'til we're in the sea

can we call it motion if the only thing that's moving is our line?
drawn across the sand as if we're sifting and adjusting space and time
'cause everything we know is just a story we've been told and keep repeating 'til we're tired
but if we try, if we try

leave me in my own skin in which i was, in which i was born
in the wind, predestined, gone before the oceans wash ashore
don't you feel it, darlin', when you sleep?
'cause i'm not stopping 'til we're in the sea
don't you feel it, darlin', when you sleep?


good love is so hard to find
we got it right for a while
do you get lonely at night?
we don't have to go home
we don't have to go

low lights, cold nights, remember when?
i call you every now and then
so good, that on and off again
and on again

oh, why don't you come over?
baby, be close to me, just like you used to be
oh, one more night to hold ya
we don't have to call it love, we just need a human touch
we don't have to call it love, we just need a human touch

i always loved how you kiss
and i'm overdue for a fix
just with a touch of your lips
i want you to come home
i want you to come home

low lights, cold nights, remember when?
i call you every now and then
so good, that on and off again
and on again

oh, why don't you come over?
baby, be close to me, just like you used to be
oh, one more night to hold ya
we don't have to call it love, we just need a human touch  yeah, yeah, yeah 
we don't have to call it love, we just need a human touch

baby, i love how we love in the in between
baby, i love how it feels when you're holding me
baby, i love how we love in the in between
baby, i love it, i love it
oh, why don't you come over?
baby, be close to me, just like you used to be

oh, why don't you come over?
baby be close to me, just like you used to be
oh, one more night to hold ya
we don't have to call it love, we just need a human touch
we don't have to call it love, we just need a human touch

we don't have to call it love, we just need a human touch


when the sun goes down on my side of town
that lonesome feeling comes to my door
the whole world turns blue
there's a rundown bar 'cross the railroad tracks
i've got a table for two way in the back
where i sit alone and think of you

i spend most every night
beneath the light of a neon moon

if you lose your one and only
there's always room here for the lonely
to watch your broken dreams
dance in and out of the beams of a neon moon

i think of two young lovers running wild and free
i close my eyes, and sometimes see
you in the shadows of this smoke filled room
no telling how many tears i've sat here and cried
or how many lies that i've lied
telling my poor heart you'll come back one day

i spend most every night
beneath the light of a neon moon

if you lose your one and only
there's always room here for the lonely
to watch your broken dreams
dance in and out of the beams of a neon moon

but i'll be alright as long as there's light
from a neon moon
and i'll be alright as long as there's light
from a neon moon

everything is running wild
lions lookin for prey
u can ask me if i'm a child
baby i'll say just for today
this land is ours
lets jump over hills
and lay here on the grass
don't have to pay the bills
when ur livin in natures grasp
oh yea
this land is ours
all i see here  is  green and blue
and ur silhouette
i'm cool if it's just me and you
u are the best
a zeal of zebras roamin through
to the jungles now here we come
sun stuck up  like glue
life in the animal kingdom
this land is ours
do we really need a tent
with a cave we can make do
an apartment for rent
i know it's no fifth avenue but
this land is ours
years have gone by like seconds on a clock
far from civilization
our bond has held strong as a rock
we've started our own nation
all i see here  is  green and blue
and ur silhouette
i'm cool if it's just me and you
u are da best


i've been bending over backwards just to make you feel like you're wanted
oh, i use up all my energy just to make sure that you know you're important
and i know that i'm not helping, i just get so insecure
and you always make me guilty just for wanting something more

but what have you done for me, lately?
oh, what have you done for me, lately?
oh, so what have you done for me, lately?
oh, what have you done for me, lately?
oh

i've been treading oh so lightly just to make sure that you're always on it
oh, i use up all my energy just to make sure that you know you're important
and you never like how my song sounds, but you give nothing of yourself
and you look at me like something's wrong if i ever ask for help

but what have you done for me, lately?
oh, what have you done for me, lately?
oh, so what have you done for me, lately?
oh, what have you done for me, lately?
oh

there's always something wrong, it must be my fault
we always got along, but not on my terms
when they sing along, well that was my song
and i guess no one's ever told you no, what do you even want this for?

so what have you done for me, lately?
oh, what have you done for me, lately?
oh, so what have you done for me, lately?
oh, what have you done for me, lately?
oh

so what have you done for me?
what have you done for me?
what have you done for me, lately?
oh

who can bring me back to life?
i can see the way that this could go
oh, haven't show your face
i heard you're somewhere here with us
i don't know who to believe
but i've been hoping
i can't tell when this will end
which is why the minutes pass so slow
i just listen to the noise
and the silence in your voice
the sound is in all i hear
you take me higher still
i know you always will
you take me higher still
you've been healing my heart
you take me higher still
i know you always will
you take me higher still
you've been healing my heart
music is the answer to your problems
keep on moving then you can solve them

if time is mess for you
will you find your feet return to me?
been spinning ropes out of the single threads
i have to hold me up
now and again i just can feel the pain is lifting
i can't tell when this would end
which is why the days are passing slow
i just listen to the noise
and the silence in your voice
the sound is in all i hear
you take me higher still
i know you always will
you take me higher still
you've been healing my heart
you take me higher still

for, for anybody but yourself

i hate it when you touch me, but i kept it under wraps
get bored during foreplay, and i think we re getting fat
tried to go the distance, but we re only wasting time

a beast to feed
licking my fingers

just one fight and just one anniversary
so i never thought you'd be the one to up and leave
you said our love was written in the stars
but i never paid attention to my charts
but now i see how quick you must want to forget
'cause you left the ring i bought you with your cigarettes
well, i can finish up if you don't want them
and i can take the ring back where i got it from

i can love it or i can leave it
you said, "honey, i best be leaving
'cause you're a novice, and i'm a taurus"
and i'm not gonna say, i'm not gonna do
i can love it or i can leave it
you said, "honey, i best be leaving"
'cause you're a taurus and i'm aquarius
and i'm not gonna say, i'm not gonna do

never thought about it sentimentally
never saw just how much you thought i meant to me
never learned about it at university
never thought about it 'cause you're the first, you see
and i'm aware of the procedure
but normally it's me that leaves her
i guess i'm finished up, it's time to move on
i'm taking the ring back to where i got it from

i can love it or i can leave it
you said, "honey, i best be leaving
'cause you're a novice and i'm a taurus

when you fell
from the sky
we all stopped and stood outside to wash our clothes
baby we got soaked
when you fell
from the sky
i felt that burning in my eyes, drove me insane
i thought that you were holy water but you were just acid rain

there's a drought in california
the weeks turned into months my dear
and i wait up all night for you
the minutes turn into fucking years
and i see you through a skylight from a mile away, a mile away
i replay all the highlights from a different state, a different state

when you fell
from the sky
we all stopped and stood outside to wash our clothes
baby we got soaked
when you fell
from the sky
i felt that burning in my eyes, drove me insane
i thought that you were holy water but you were just acid rain

i fill my cup from the tap
i let my sips overlap
i let the sink overflow
i drink it down 'til i'm bones
and i feel i can't be honest
about anything i wanted
cause you're taunting with memories
without even talking and i pray
for a drought again
yeah i pray for damage undid
oh and i d give anything
to just take back the love i misplaced in you

when you fell
from the sky
we all stopped and stood outside to wash our clothes
baby we got soaked
when you fell
from the sky
i felt that burning in my eyes, drove me insane
i thought that you were holy water but you were just acid rain

i thought that you were holy water but you were just acid rain
i thought that you were holy water but you were just acid rain
i thought that you were holy water but you were just acid rain


thought i saw you
payphone on rucker
michelle, i still want to give in
i'd understand if you did

how long must we live right
before we don't even have to try?

note from your daughter
drawing of three flowers
i still keep it with me
does she still want to sing?

how long must we live right
before we don't even have to try?

i hear the sound of a million drums
with no beat
violins with no melody
i'm sick with it  
quiet

i don't blame you for wanting out
i'm kind of close myself
no love, no amount
never enough to go around


you're a holiday
a glass of ocean slipping down my throat
and landing on my hopes, i'm dreaming
off the maps, no hidden grids, i'm fleeing
i worship you like holy days
lying on my back, seeing clouds and rays
drinking lime and bitter from my lemonade
white horses, maritime won't do

do you remember?
the holiday slipped away
time and place
i definitely remember
lying on my back and seeing clouds and rays
we're dreaming with feelings, whoa
forever we're young
pages unsung, ooh
i feel that you remember
dreaming of a past that couldn't last
but now we're changing
refraining

i'm thinkin it's the, know that it's the
i'm thinkin it's the bad, bad blood
i'm thinkin it's the, know that it's the
i'm thinkin it's the bad, bad blood

do you remember?
the riding, the passion, the falling over
and tripping on ice
sharing advice, taking it twice
but let us not forget the
silent days, stripped away
time and place
oh, you choose not to remember
fly away and counting days
i'm hiding from you, ooh

i'm thinkin it's the, know that it's the
i'm thinkin it's the bad, bad blood
i'm thinkin it's the, know that it's the
i'm thinkin it's the bad, bad blood

i choose
for the rain not to fall
exposing the soil on you
i lose
don't tell me i'm cuckoo, i know
and it's mad, we were close, oh
i choose
my head's now afloat
but my heart's drowning boats of you
i lose
don't tell me i'm coo coo
coo coo coo coo coo coo ooh ooh

i'm thinkin it's the, know that it's the
i'm thinkin it is the bad, bad blood
i'm thinkin it is the, know that it's the
i'm thinkin it is the bad, bad blood
i'm thinkin it's the, know that it's the
i'm thinkin it is the bad, bad blood
i'm thinkin it is the, know that it's the
i'm thinkin it is the bad, bad


take me back to when
i picked a fight with you
right out of the blue
i wish we made amends
i didn't mean to lose
all the good times that i had with you

i'm sorry, i'm sorry
if it doesn't mean too much right now
i know that you've probably forgotten
but these things still weigh me down
take me back to when
i picked a fight with you, ooh

i miss the way my mama knew what to do
she said to do right by your neighbour
and they'll do right by you
when we get older we can forget the truth
that if you do right by your neighbour
then they'll do right by you

we play this like a game
why do we pretend
that we were never friends?
when we both haven't changed
enough to just forget
the windows we broke with another
the secrets we spoke

i'm sorry, i'm sorry
if it doesn't mean too much right now
i know that you've probably forgotten
but these things still weigh me down

i miss the way my mama knew what to do
she said to do right by your neighbour
and they'll do right by you
when we get older we can forget the truth
that if you do right by your neighbour
then they'll do right by you

i'm sorry, i'm sorry
if it doesn't mean too much right now
i know that you've probably forgotten
but these things still weigh me down

i miss the way my mama knew what to do
she said to do right by your neighbour
and they'll do right by you
when we get older we can forget the truth
that if you do right by your neighbour
then they'll do right by you


show me something that i've never seen
cause i'm lost and i need feeding
give me things that i've never had
cause i'm bad at seeing ahead, it's true

i'll never find another like you
similar tone but a different hue
could never love another like you
i've been out living, it's true
but enough's enough

i'll never find another like you
i'll never find another like you
not in this life

carved our circles into broken skin
cause i'm lost and i need bleeding
tear a paper into smithereens
no prose or poem will do you truth

i'll never find another like you
similar tone but a different hue
could never love another like you
i've been out living, it's true
but enough's enough

i'll never find another like you
i'll never find another like you
not in this life

chastise me like i'm seventeen
cause i'm stuck and i've been waiting
frame me in our murder
cause i'm tired of looking for sense, it's true

i'll never find another like you
i'll never find another like you
not in this life

 i guess what i'm trying to say is that there was a point where i knew 
i was blind and i could barely see
 fading away...faded away into sort of a distant memory and 
i was blind and i could barely see
 the reason, uh, the reason... i don't really know 
i was blind and i could barely see
 i don't remember what side, i don't remember where it started, and in the end 
i was blind and i could barely see


i like the sound of your heartbeat
your pulse is pushing against me
i'm good when you are around
you keep me warm in your bloodstream
you keep me calm when you breathe in
now i don't know what i've done

i've been trying but not enough
please do not give up on us

i'm a wolf howling
in the moonlight, calling out
like a fool
howling on your doorstep, calling out

i hate that everything's different
my clothes, my haircut is different
but still i'm feeling the same
what is eternal about love?
if there's a way to turn it off
you know, so show me the way

but if trying could mean enough
you will not give up on us

i'm a wolf howling
in the moonlight, calling out
like a fool
howling on your doorstep, calling out

i'm a wolf howling
on your doorstep, calling out


you came in swinging like apollo
i'll be feelin' it tomorrow
no, i ain't seein' straight, hyperventilate
knees begin to wobble
you cut my brakes and hit the throttle
i couldn't stop it if i wanted
just your silhouette, makes me break a sweat
i'm in trouble

oh, i've been dazed and confused
from the day i met you
yeah, i lost my head
and i'd do it again
either i've seen the light
or i'm losing my mind
there's something 'bout you
that's got me dazed and confused

dazed
dazed and confused
dazed

i bet you know just what you're doing
you're not the type that's used to losing
first, you build me up, then with just a touch
leave me here in ruins
something 'bout your eyes
i can't even walk in a straight line
under the influence

oh, i've been dazed and confused
from the day i met you
yeah, i lost my head
and i'd do it again
either i've seen the light
or i'm losing my mind
there's something 'bout you
that's got me dazed and confused

dazed
dazed and confused
dazed

i don't know if this is real life, real life
what happens if i open my eyes, my eyes?
will i ever get my head right, head right?
i don't know if this is real life, real life

oh, i've been dazed and confused
from the day i met you
yeah, i lost my head
and i'd do it again
either i've seen the light
or i'm losing my mind
there's something 'bout you
that's got me
that's got me dazed and confused
from the day i met you
yeah, i lost my head
and i'd do it again
either i've seen the light
or i'm losing my mind
there's something 'bout you
that's got me dazed and confused


is it really me you're missing?
or am i the only one who'll listen? mmm
all of these high hopes and low blows
i hope you know
just how much it hurts to believe you
i should cut this off, but i need you
i should help myself, but i can't help myself

is it really me you're missing?
or am i the only one who'll listen to you?
and if i pick up the phone tonight
will it be pieces by the morning?
am i the only number that you've tried?
or is it just another lonely night?

everybody tells me what i should've done now
'cause i only ever tell them when you're letting me down
oh, high hopes and low blows
i hope you know
just how much i've wanted to leave you
but there's nobody else that can be you
i should help myself

is it really me you're missing?
or am i the only one who'll listen to you?
and if i pick up the phone tonight
will it be pieces by the morning?
am i the only number that you've tried?
or is it just another lonely night?

is it really me?
and if you turn all the lights off
and put your hands on my body
could i be just anybody?  is it really me? 
and when you get what you wanted
is that the end of the story?
i know you'll never be sorry
until it's really me you're missing

is it really me you're missing?
or am i the only one who'll listen to you?
and if i pick up the phone tonight
will it be pieces by the morning?
am i the only number that you've tried?
or is it just another lonely night?

is it really me you're missing?
is it really me?
is it really me?


look inside, look inside your tiny mind
then look a bit harder
'cause we're so uninspired, so sick and tired
of all the hatred you harbour
so you say it's not okay to be gay
well, i think you're just evil
you're just some racist who can't tie my laces
your point of view is medieval

fuck you  fuck you , fuck you very, very much
'cause we hate what you do
and we hate your whole crew
so please, don't stay in touch
fuck you  fuck you , fuck you very, very much
'cause your words don't translate
and it's getting quite late
so please, don't stay in touch

do you get, do you get a little kick out of being small minded?
you want to be like your father, his approval you're after
well, that's not how you find it
do you, do you really enjoy living a life that's so hateful?
'cause there's a hole where your soul should be
you're losing control of it
and it's really distasteful

fuck you  fuck you , fuck you very, very much
'cause we hate what you do
and we hate your whole crew
so please, don't stay in touch
fuck you  fuck you , fuck you very, very much
'cause your words don't translate
and it's getting quite late
so please, don't stay in touch

fuck you, fuck you, fuck you
fuck you, fuck you, fuck you
fuck you

you say you think we need to go to war
well, you're already in one
'cause it's people like you that need to get slew
no one wants your opinion

fuck you  fuck you , fuck you very, very much
'cause we hate what you do
and we hate your whole crew
so please, don't stay in touch
fuck you  fuck you , fuck you very, very much
'cause your words don't translate
and it's getting quite late
so please, don't stay in touch

fuck you, fuck you, fuck you
fuck you, fuck you, fuck you
fuck you, fuck you, fuck you...


the streets are quiet and my heart feels like fire
so i guess and play the waiting game
make no mistake, my heart lies awake
down the tunnel i made, i can feel this way
for you, for you

i keep running from my shadow
hide from the sun; i won't be found
everywhere i go, it follows
i find my feet when i'm off the ground
and i keep running from my shadow
hide from the sun; i won't be found
and everywhere i go, it follows
i find my feet when i'm off the ground
and oh, we're running from my shadows
oh, we're running from my shadows

the streets are quiet and it feels so right
to be out of line like the shape of my veins
for you, for you, for you

and i keep running from my shadow
hide from the sun; i won't be found
and everywhere i go, it follows
i find my feet when i'm off the ground
and i keep running from my shadow
hide from the sun; i won't be found
and everywhere i go, it follows
i find my feet when i'm off the ground
and oh, we're running from my shadow
oh, we're running from my shadows
woah, and oh, we're running from my shadows
oh, we're running from my shadows

we're so out of line
we're so out of line
we're so out of line
we're so out of line


1, 2, 3, 4

i love the way it flows
i love the way it grows
there s something in this sound that takes me far
it s like a special song
can move my mood along
but i cannot say you ll hear through my guitar

she told me add a bassline
and everything will be alright
she told me that the groove is mine
it will take us through the night
and where i ll go
can t explain i ll never know
but it s beautiful

you can t take this away from me
the way i hear the melody
the waves bring clarity
running through me
you can t take this away from me
the way i hear the melody
the waves bring clarity
running through me

i love the way it sings
all the joy that it brings
remember skating down the road towards the park?
i can never say no
you with that summer glow
the music gives me sun when winter starts

she told me add a bassline
and everything will be alright
she told me that the beat is mine
it will rock us through the night
and where i ll go
can t explain i ll never know
but it s beautiful

you can t take this away from me  oh 
the way i hear the melody
the waves bring clarity
running through me
you can t take this away from me  oh 
the way i hear the melody
the waves bring clarity
running through me

you can t take this away from me  oh 
the way i hear the melody
the waves bring clarity
running through me
you can t take this away from me  oh 
the way i hear the melody
the waves bring clarity
running through me

yo, i wear notes like coats
blues like doos, warm from the rhythm, soul that glues
that bounce to my bones, that jazz in my spine
the hop is my home, rap is my grind
i'm grindin' on the back side of life, we dance
she threw me a chance, her hands in my pants
actually, my pockets holdin' me tight
whispering a dream i could hold in the night
blood tight, a rhythm that's throbbin' my veins
wake up and write it on a pad, the pains
like church, the organ will invite the tears
like birth, i'm cryin', let you know i'm here
held by the song that gave me a name
dressed by the verse that gave me a claim
 there s just a bass in the line  safe to inhale
and if you live well
belonger years in this state, you will be
a timeless octave to play for the tree
that s rooted in every single nerve in me
the nerve of he who ignores the key
and use it to opens the minds that be free
whenever you're hot head ignores you, you are free
beneath the clouds, you allowed to see, in clarity
through harmony, someone harmin  me?
that won't be done
i stand protected by the laws of fun
i am perfected through the rhymes of run
walkin' this way and leave the party stunned
this music, it launched me
with no aim, i've landed with some plane
where i am i can't explain or never know
but it's beautiful so...

you can t take this away from me
the way i hear the melody
the waves bring clarity
running through me  c'mon y'all 
you can t take this away from me
the way i hear the melody
the waves bring clarity
running through me

you go find, you go find

i took you to the jeweler, told you "pick a ring"
i took you to the dealer, told you "pick a range"
i took you to the parlor, spent a hundred dollars
on a tattoo of your name and your face
and when all of the cash out, credit card maxed
buy myself a house, baby, you the realest date

oh, he treats me with respect
he says he loves me all the time
he calls me fifteen times a day
he likes to make sure that i'm fine
you know i've never met a man
who's made me feel quite so secure
he's not like all them other boys
they're all so dumb and immature

there's just one thing

you never make me scream
oh, it's not fair
and it's really not okay
it's really not okay
it's really not okay
oh, you're supposed to care
but all you do is take
yeah, all you do is take


all the kids run around playing free and fun, while the dogs lap around the can
falling down, climbing trees, swimming in the river, no life jacket on their backs
daughters sharpen their knives and they hunt for food, others watch their children grow
mothers going to work and they shake the hands of a corporate tycoon's ghost

and i'm afraid  ahhhh 
i'm so afraid  ahhhh 
what if i lose?
is what i think to myself
i'm fine in my shell
i'm afraid of it all, afraid of loving you

i'm a gift and a curse to the wilderness when the leaves only turn to brown
the birds fly high and they wink at all of the grandmothers on the ground
rain pours down in the village dens, my cousins fetch for lunch
while i sit in my room writing letters to my church and things and such

'cause i'm afraid  ahhhh 
i'm so afraid  ahhhh 
what if i lose?
is what i think to myself
i'm fine in my shell
i'm afraid of it all, afraid of loving you

cousins all in the creek
ridin' high, write a zine
and the rain pours down, the ghetto dancin', yeah

i'm so afraid  ahhhh 
i'm so afraid  ahhhh 
what if i lose?

electric lights

coming up until we die

i don't wanna go to school
i just wanna break the rules
boys and girls across the world
putting on our dancing shoes
going to the discotheque
getting high and getting wrecked
i don't wanna go to school
i just wanna break the rules

i'm such a star
queen boulevard
blaze through the dark


:
get my guitar
sunglasses on
so light it up

i couldn't speak so i slurred while i looked for a word
but you left just before i could find it
i sat by myself and i stared at the pictures of you on the wall

i kissed the floor, curled up in a ball
there's nothing coming out of my mouth so i said nothing at all

babe, you've got a face like thunder
always trying to get out with another
just stay still 'til i say it's over
babe, you've got a face like thunder

and you question your lover, did she really believe
that this new taste of love is obsolete?  
it just couldn't compete and so you ll keep dragging your body through life by the hair so you can say that you've been somewhere and you don't care of your receipt
you're sentenced to death and you can't be reprieved

babe, you've got a face like thunder
always trying to get out with another
just stay still 'til i say it's over
babe, you've got a face like thunder

say sorry for a while, for a while, for a while
you know i didn't mean it
i said something terrible and i tried to redeem it
i can be so cruel although i don't seem it

kissed you in the park
we'll meet up after dark
in your car with the backseat, southern summer
ignored all the missed calls from your mother
and kiss me in the park
we'll meet up after dark
and we'll talk until morning hits the windshield
and paints yellow lines on the field

now you want to start
with someone not so far
oh she's bubbly and sweet like a coca cola
i watch from my drink as you look her over
the tab don't pop too hard
you're sick of playing cards
with your love, you want warmth and i'm somethin' colder
i'm putting your hands to her heart

i don't think of my life
anywhere but in your arms tonight
won't say it this time
can't even look back in your eyes

kissed you in the park
we'll meet up after dark
it's a bite of the apple, the touch of your lips
i'm stuck in the bathroom and sick over it
'cause you're made from the stars
that we watched from your car
and i'm just a victim of changing planets
my scorpio rising and my parents

i don't think of my life
anywhere but in your arms tonight
won't say it this time
can't even look back in your eyes


true, it's dance, we know the moves
the bow, the dip, the woo
though the words are true
the state is old news
wrap me in your arms
i can t feel it but
rock me in your arms
i can't feel it but
get up, get down
get up, get down
feel the turn of rotation and stop
see the next one waiting
get up, get down
get up, get down
get up
sentiment's the same but the pair of feet change
i know my words will dry upon the skin
just like a name i remember hearing
wild winters, warm coffee
mom s gone, do you love me?
blazing summer, cold coffee
baby's gone, do you love me?
wrap me in your arms
i can't feel it but
rock me in your arms
i can't feel it but
get up, get down
get up, get down
feel the turn of rotation and stop
see the next one waiting
get up, get down
get up, get down
get up
sentiment's the same but the pair of feet change
get up, get down
get up, get down
feel the general attention
and stop, see the mix won't work
get up, get down
get up, get down
get up
sentiment's the same but the pair of feet change
my baby does the hanky panky, baby
my baby does
 rock me 
my baby does the hanky panky, baby
 in your arms 
my baby does
get up, get down
get up, get down
feel the general attention
and stop, see the mix won't work
get up, get down
get up, get down
get up
sentiment s the same but the pair of feet change


heaving, hollow
breathing, so slow
upright, but tiring
lost sight, climbing

coming to rest, at great height
we're formless, in the low light
in the warmth of your glow i'm alright
though i wish i could claw back some time
i could breathe in the colors so bright

heaving, hollow
breathing, so slow
upright, but tiring
lost sight, climbing

coming to rest, at great height
we're formless, in the low light
in the warmth of your glow i'm alright
though i wish i could claw back some time
i could breathe in the colors so bright


better off, trading my regards
thinking on, i want to play more safely
frozen days, that pragmatic start
now they're gone, the night just stays so empty
who's to say, being strong keeps you unglued
is it a fact, you haven't a clue
puzzle solved, smashing down your weight in gold
take it back, you handle it

it's not enough, just so you know
through bleeding intentions, you'll see all of us
a bitter crush, it's time to go
your secret endeavors were always too much

extend your grip, turning black like you do
slow inhale, an endless void you granted
magnet poles gonna tear us in two
wanna know just how the end goal shifted
hurting hope, chase another thankless pursuit
i heard she called when you were in rouge
close the gate, soul feels like it's forever new
when i'm through don't blink on it

it's not enough  we could fake it all away 
just so you know  i'd already noticed 
through bleeding intentions, you'll see all of us  motives, change 
a bitter crush  listen, it's late, just stay 
it's time to go  why do we still do this? 
your secret endeavors were always too much  it's pointless, ok 

kept all the love inside your palm
i needed attention, you wouldn't give up
it's time to stop, you've done enough
i've taken up waiting and thinking of us

it's not enough  we could fake it all away 
just so you know  i'd already noticed 
through bleeding intentions, you'll see all of us  motives, change 
a bitter crush  listen, it's late, just stay 
it's time to go  why do we still do this? 
your secret endeavors were always too much  it's pointless, ok 
kept all the love  seeking in the night or day 
inside your palm  trying for a daydream 
i needed attention, you wouldn't give up  with us, babe 
it's time to stop  feed me words you want to say 
you've done enough  are you even trying? 
i've taken up waiting and thinking of us  or wasting the flame 
 flame, flame, flame, flame, flame 
 flame, flame, flame, flame, flame 
 flame, flame, flame, flame, flame, flame 


i couldn't speak so i slurred while i looked for a word
but you left just before i could find it
i sat by myself and i stared at the pictures of you on the wall

i kissed the floor, curled up in a ball
there's nothing coming out of my mouth so i said nothing at all

babe, you've got a face like thunder
always trying to get out with another
just stay still 'til i say it's over
babe, you've got a face like thunder

and you question your lover, did she really believe
that this new taste of love is obsolete?  
it just couldn't compete and so you ll keep dragging your body through life by the hair so you can say that you've been somewhere and you don't care of your receipt
you're sentenced to death and you can't be reprieved

babe, you've got a face like thunder
always trying to get out with another
just stay still 'til i say it's over
babe, you've got a face like thunder

say sorry for a while, for a while, for a while
you know i didn't mean it
i said something terrible and i tried to redeem it
i can be so cruel although i don't seem it

dizzy, we're caught in a spin
if i was older, then would you still let me win

cold, so cold
and all that you say again
is like
don't go, so cold
you're not the same

seriously
at last it bothers me
under the blue of my desire to be
never takin', myself that seriously
don't think it bothers me

chasin', the depths of ascent
i had to learn it 
to savor the consequences

cold, so cold
and all that you say again
is like
don't go, so cold
you're not the same

seriously
at last it bothers me
under the blue, of my desire to be
never takin', myself that seriously
don't think it bothers me
seriously
at last it bothers me
under the blue of my desire to be
never takin' myself that seriously
don't think it bothers me


tell me where you thought you saw me
tell me why you asked my name
tell me how you've come to be in this place
tell the story how you want to
make up all the details
tell me what feels good, i don't care

you're no stranger
you're no stranger to me

take me for another body
come out of the wilderness
maybe just a window you could've passed
take me through your barricades
push me through your city walls
take me, i can be whoever you want

you're no stranger
you're no stranger to me
no stranger
you're no stranger to me

nothing here is set in stone
nothing here is set in stone
nothing here is set in stone
you don't even know where i come from
could i be someone that you can trust?
nothing here is set in stone

falling, falling
falling, falling

although i've hardened
darling, my guard is down
when i know you're around
only one that fit the crown

when i need love i run to you
you're the only one i want, want you now
silly shit we go through
i cop my keys and i'm out

i'm on my way right now
promise i won't be long
baby, keep the blue light on
my chains, they come falling down, down
my chains, they come falling down
my chains, they come falling

i'm begging your pardon
told myself i needed time
but my discipline is slipping
head first

'cause, baby, with your love around
i could save the world
for better now
i want you where you are right now

i'm on my way right now
promise i won't be long
baby, keep the blue light on
chains, they come falling down

i'm full of good intentions
like i never was before
it's too late for prevention
but i don't think it's too late for cure
so you call in your minions
see what you can't find
night time or morning
these hands are sticky but i don't mind
why must you always be around?
why can't you just leave it be?
it's done nothing so far but destroy my life
you cause as much sorrow dead
as you did when you were alive
i never said i was tough
that was everyone else
so you're a fool to attack me
for the image that you built yourself
it just sounds more vicious
then i actually mean
i really am soft
yes, i'm tender + sweet
why must you always be around?
why can't you just leave it be?
you've done nothing so far but destroy my life
you cause as much sorrow dead
as you did when you were alive
why must you always ask me?
why can't you just leave it be?
you've done nothing so far but destroy my life
you cause as much sorrow dead
as you did when you were alive


i walked across an empty land
i knew the pathway like the back of my hand
i felt the earth beneath my feet
sat by the river and it made me complete

oh simple thing, where have you gone?
i'm getting tired and i need someone to rely on

i came across a fallen tree
i felt the branches of it looking at me
is this the place we used to love?
is this the place that i've been dreaming of?

oh simple thing, where have you gone?
i'm getting old and i need something to rely on

and if you have a minute why don't we go
talk about it somewhere only we know?
this could be the end of everything
so why don't we go
somewhere only we know
somewhere only we know

oh simple thing, where have you gone?
i'm getting old and i need someone to rely on
so tell me when you're gonna let me in
i'm getting tired and i need somewhere to begin

so if you have a minute why don't we go
talk about it somewhere only we know?
this could be the end of everything
so why don't we go
somewhere only we know
somewhere only we know


can you tell me what to have and what to hold
if you never take the weight on your own?
no one tells us what is hard and what is fair
and we will deliver once we know where to fall

we are made of our longest days
we are falling but not alone
we will take the best parts of ourselves
and make them gold
we are made of our smallest thoughts
we are breathing and letting go
we will take the best parts of ourselves
and make them gold

can you steady all the hands that you hold
if you never look away from the drop?
if you push yourself then i will pull you on
and we will deliver once we know where to fall

we are made of our longest days
we are falling but not alone
we will take the best parts of ourselves
and make them gold
we are made of our smallest thoughts
we are breathing and letting go
we will take the best parts of ourselves
and make them gold

i will wait to see if you come at all
to stop us falling out of phase
let's see if we can keep track of losing days
you smile so wide i can see the sides
just stop us falling out of phase
i will be with you in the fray
with those second thoughts you asked for
all you asked for

we are made of our longest days
we are falling but not alone
we will take the best parts of ourselves
and make them gold
we are made of our smallest thoughts
we are breathing and letting go
we will take the best parts of ourselves
and make them gold

and make them gold

you holding your phone tight
you lock it up like fort knox
something just ain't right
feels like you re punching a clock
our fire is fleeting
i've seen your type before
you're probably cheating
late night you sneak out the door

i pretend i pretend that we ll work it out
but you're slipping away
reached the end reached the end if we're honest now
we'll let go today

i've seen your dms
you don't hide that shit too well
you're gone for the weekend
by monday i'll be outta here
you say you re different
but why your actions the same
you say i m trippin
truth is i'm over your game


eyes are tired, looking for a sign
of anything that might give relief
fantasizing all the things in my mind
will i feel more me?
punctual, waiting for a thrill
to wake me from this deep dark sleep
blaming myself for making plans that fill
into the cracks i call my dreams

i know you seen it all around my anxiety
it likes to strut, it loves the sight, oh
the sight of me
creeping through the doors and under all my sheets
i can never sleep, it worries me

search the world, parties, even girls
but nothing makes me feel anything
tried to attach to anybody s hope
but help me get me off my knees
over controlled, the tension leaves me holding onto all of my personal things
now i m out calling every doubt
that s tryna make a fool of me

i know you seen it all around my anxiety
it likes to strut, it loves the sight, oh
the sight of me
creeping through the doors and under all my sheets
i can never sleep, it worries me

anxiety in the seams
anxiety on your feet
anxiety in the seams
anxiety on your feet


i always knew i had a voice but only used it when i'm all alone
am i sinking deep or standing tall  tall, tall, tall... 
only thing that kept me goin' were the haters that would say that i could never make it on my own
maybe one day i could prove 'em wrong

don't wake me up and go, whoa
don't wake me up and go, whoa

i've been dreamin', i've been dreamin'
i've been dreamin' of this day for a lifetime
i've been dreamin', i've been dreamin'
i've been dreamin' of this day for a lifetime
i've been waitin' for this moment since i was young
a thousand light years around the sun
i've been dreamin', i've been dreamin'
i've been dreamin' of this day for a lifetime

i try and jump across a mountain thinkin' i know where i need to go
i always end up at the bottom where i started off
'cause i was walkin' down the street with no reason
thinkin' i could never amount to nothin', oh no
maybe one day i could prove 'em wrong

don't wake me up and go, whoa
don't wake me up and go, whoa

i've been dreamin', i've been dreamin'
i've been dreamin' of this day for a lifetime
i've been dreamin', i've been dreamin'

i've been waitin' for this moment since i was young
a thousand light years around the sun

i came alive, i came alive
i came alive, i came alive
i came alive, i came alive

i've been dreamin', i've been dreamin'
i've been dreamin' of this day for a lifetime

it's been a while like ancient history
now here you are digging up those memories
somethings are better left buried, honestly
no time for thinking 'bout what things could've been
it's kinda hard for me to hear what you say
i'm deafened by the lies you fabricate
i'm not saying, i'm not saying that i wish you bad
but i ain't throwing fountain pennies tryna wish you back, no

used to never hit reply when i hit you up
but now you try, try, try with your phoney love
it's like you think that i've become somebody different
let me address that my address don't make no difference
what's inside ain't defined by your zip code
did you really think that i wouldn't know?
take a second and i'll bless you with some information
i'd rather haters than some lovers who be lovers faking

all the ones who broke my heart
they want a piece of it now
they want a piece of it now
 ain't it funny how 
all the ones who cut me out
how come they calling me now?

i was always thinking of games that i was playing
trying to make the best of my time
but only love can break your heart
try to be sure right from the start
yes, only love can break your heart
but if your world should fall apart
i have a friend i've never seen
he hides his head inside a dream
someone should call him and see if he can come out
try to lose the down that he's found
but only love can break your heart
try to be sure right from the start
yes, only love can break your heart
but if your world should fall apart

before you take a second look, remember i know every trick in the book
it never stops around the clock
when i'm there, you speak so soft
the runaround will wear you out
you break it off, i'll break you down
the world is full of good intentions
paradise is full of lies
tell you they love you but fail to mention
who they were with again last night
cheating, sneaking   i wrote the book
begging, pleading   i wrote the book
lying, crying   i wrote the book on it
don't test me
heartbreak and then some, tell me where is a friend when you need one

umpteenth imaginary notes
you sing them beautifully
slinging kid slang at the cars
they can't hear you spar
labor loves at a loss

i want to join the tribe that you protect
distinctively unerect
you think you suffered enough to burn
all the accolades that you've earned
these are imaginary notes
these are my imaginary notes


run, run, running
drive me away, i
see 'em come, come, coming
don't wanna stay, wanna stay in
days like, days like this, like this

trying to escape from them, from them
i guess, i guess, i guess

we drive and we disconnect
we drive and we disconnect
send my best, no regrets
with the wind, i'm gone
i guess, i guess
we drive and we disconnect

tell me to stay
but i can't, even if i wanted
tell me to lie
but i committed too many crimes
let's stay like, stay like this, like this
why can't we remain like this, like this?

trying to escape from them, from them
i guess, i guess, i guess

we drive and we disconnect

in the summer
you said you loved me like an animal
stayed beside me
just enough to keep your belly full
then you took me down to the water got your mouth all clean
left me drowning once you picked me out your bloody teeth

spent the autumn
in the forest hunting for a wolf
tried to find you
stopped my searching when the nights grew cold
dreamt i saw you down by the water with your mouth still clean
you were searching   i came to you and you said to me
that i'm not  

only what you wanted for a little while
only what you wanted for a little while
only what you wanted for a little while
only what you wanted for a little while

through the winter
i was shuttered in between my sheets
checked the window
just to see if you d come back to me
the spring was coming, i saw you running down to the creek
a ring finger fell to the water from your bloody teeth
i guess i'm  

only what you wanted for a little while
only what you wanted for a little while
only what you wanted for a little while
only what you wanted for a little while

supposed to know this time that you wouldn't come
that you wouldn't come home

but four drinks i'm wasted
i can see you dancing, i can lay down next to you
at the foot of my bed
if i drink enough
i can taste your lipstick, i can lay down next to you
but it's all in my head
if i drink enough i swear that i will wake up next to you

when you left, you took my bestest friends away
and in this mess, i think i dug a thousand graves
talia, i hope you're happy anyway

but four drinks i'm wasted
i can see you dancing, i can lay down next to you
at the foot of my bed
if i drink enough
i can taste your lipstick, i can lay down next to you
but it's all in my head
if i drink enough i swear that i will wake up next to you

broke my heart now i'm wasting my time on you
broke my heart now i'm wasting my time
if i drink enough
i can see you dancing, i can lay down next to you
at the foot of my bed
if i drink enough
i can taste your lipstick, i can lay down next to you
but it's all in my head

i can taste your lipstick, i can lay down next to you
but it's all in my head
if i drink enough i swear that i will wake up next to you

hit the ground
the yard, i found something
i could taste your mouth
shut the door
now in the sun tanning
you were so just
looking across the sky
can't remember
i can't recall, no
i can't remember anything at all
we skipped the sunrise
looking across the grass
said he wanted
and not that i'm every
it's the same, i could mean you were right
everyone else
hasn't a chance, don't
fail me now
open arms, rest

cursing myself at night

chew me out when i'm stupid
i don't wanna
everyone else pales

you're the glitter in the dark

and your tears feel hot on my bed sheets

when your smile is so wide and your heels are so high
you can't cry
get your glad rags on and let's sing along
to that lonely song

a photograph without a face
but with your presence and your grace
everything falls into place

'cause i might not say it back
doesn't mean my heart stops skipping when
you look at me like that
there's no need to worry when
you see just where we're at
just please don't say you love me
'cause i might not say it back

heavy words are hard to take
under pressure, precious things can break
and how we feel is hard to fake
so let's not give the game away

just please don't say you love me
'cause i might not say it back
doesn't mean my heart stops skipping when
you look at me like that
there's no need to worry when
you see just where we're at
just please don't say you love me
'cause i might not say it back

fools rush in
and i've been the fool before
this time, i'm gonna slow it down
'cause i think this could be more
the thing i'm looking for

just please don't say you love me
'cause i might not say it back
doesn't mean my heart stops skipping when
you look at me like that
there's no need to worry when
you see just where we're at
just please don't say you love me
'cause i might not say it back

please don't say you love me
'cause i might not say it back
doesn't mean my heart stops skipping when
you look at me like that
there's no need to worry when
you see just where we're at
just please don't say you love me
'cause i might not say it back

just please don't say you love me
'cause i might not say it back


will you take me as i am?
drive the coastline in your hand
across the highway there's a girl i used to be
swim in the deep end, not afraid of anything

i feel like an ocean, washing away
gasping for air now under the wave
you're pulling me deeper, deeper 'til i'm broken
i feel like an ocean, washing away
dreading the silence, nothing to say
you're pulling me deeper, deeper 'til i'm broken

fragile creatures, you and i
read my future, is it bright?
do you feel better knowing that i'm far away?
maybe it's alright living with a memory

i feel like an ocean, washing away
gasping for air now under the wave
you're pulling me deeper, deeper 'til i'm broken
i feel like an ocean, washing away
dreading the silence, nothing to say
you're pulling me deeper, deeper 'til i'm broken

is it over, is it over?
you're pulling me deeper, deeper 'til i'm broken


all the little gifts you gave
i call it overcompensating
feeling just like a princess
every answer was always yes
you had me living in a dream
was forever long to you?  to you 
did you say that to her too?
making sure that i d never know
callin' her while the shower goes
then crawl back in bed, it's a shame

i probably should ve known better
i probably should ve known better
every word you said
yeah, you was sweet, but you was lying
everything you covered up
making up, just to keep me from crying, oh

i wish that you woulda treated me bad
the truth is, you couldn t have loved me better
now i m left feeling twice as sad
i wish you woulda treated me bad, bad, bad

i wasn t catching on to you  to you 
blinded by your lips, so smooth  so smooth 
excusing all of your 'gotta go's'
leaving me to be all alone
then you took my heart just the same

i probably should ve known better

every word you said, yeah, you was sweet, but you was lying

like their plan, it's not alignin'
i guess they feel it when it's gone
when you're finally movin' on
when they know you stopped believin'
they'll never be what you wanted
they blame it on the timing
when they've found their silver lining

when you came around
when the high wore off
know you needed space
but i don't wanna wait
i don't wanna mistake

few thousand miles, and an ocean away
but i see the sunrise, just like the other day
picture your eyes as i fall asleep
tell myself it's alright
as the tears roll by

oh, oh, oh
i wish i could feel your face
oh, oh, oh
i'm helpless when i'm oceans away

i never felt
a room so still
see the future coming
hope it isn't real
i learned to fake a smile
as the time runs out
i don't wanna wait
oh, i don't wanna mistake

few thousand miles and an ocean away
but i see the sunrise, just like the other day

your possessions will possess you

silas says he'll take me far away
you can tell he means it by the look on his face
run until the hurt and open road is far behind us
my silas

silas says my name like it's a prayer
a quiet reverence hanging in the air
and as for demons running 'round my mind
you'll never find us
my silas

how could i deserve him?
when i could never earn him?
all that i can see
is how kind he is to me

on the nights i cry til i can't breathe
silas stays with me until i sleep
hands that hold my heart so tenderly
could never bind us
my silas

i'm hopelessly romantic
and hopefully he can stand it
all that i can know
is i never want to let him go

silas will be back for me one day


‪june's glowing red
oh strawberry moon
you're always coming back a little older
but it looks alright on you

let's find an out
we'll start anew
and with the headlights in your eyes
i see it all over you

burn out when you want
something that's lost belongs to you
someone should pay for it
well i don't know who


i wash away in your river of gold
i'm losing this on these dead end roads

and i'm lost in the waters
your light is my shore
i'm searching for answers
because all i know is i'm losing hope

i'm bathing in sunshine, lost in space
waiting for your sign to set me straight
where do i go from here?
when will this road seem clear?
i'm bathing in sunshine, lost in space
waiting for your sign to set me straight
where do i go from here?
when will this road seem clear?
i'm bathing in sunshine
i'm bathing in sunshine

i stay afloat in these jeans of stones
this heavy road, it don't take me home

and i'm lost in the waters
your light is my shore
i'm searching for answers
because all i know is i'm losing hope

i'm bathing in sunshine, lost in space
waiting for your sign to set me straight
where do i go from here?
when will this road seem clear?
i'm bathing in sunshine, lost in space
waiting for your sign to set me straight
where do i go from here?
when will this road seem clear?
i'm bathing in sunshine


look back
to when midnights broke their sleep
awake in our memories
of when we would make believe
collide
colors of the masquerade
watch as they fall away
faceless under faces made

and weeks went by but felt like hours
spring would lie in summer showers
in my hair were winter flowers
and weeks went by but felt like hours
seasons multiplying powers
that i found in winter flowers

turn back
i see rivers beyond the line
ancient roads in broken design
angels running thru our minds
look up
your city's built on marble floors
neon lights in the falling snow
those nights back in tokyo

and weeks went by but felt like hours
spring would lie in summer showers
in my hair were winter flowers
and weeks went by but felt like hours
seasons multiplying powers
that i found in winter flowers

and we said
this has only just begun
in the end
time forever favors the young
and we said
this has only just begun
in the end
time forever favors the young



give me a second light, i haven't smiled since yesterday
if i need to i can pay, but let me hold this 'til i feel okay
since you burned me at the stake, all of my feelings went away
there s no feelings in my way
at least there s no feelings in my way

i was there when you were blind to everything that i could see
i'll pretend that it's just me, but maybe really it's just me
i forgot what it was like, to think i found you finally
what if you were the one for me
i hope you weren't the one for me

and i know this
i can t read it right, between the fights
i still need you
and i know this
i fell for your eyes, i just realized
i still need you
i still need you

give me 'til twenty three, i need another year for this
trying to teach my common sense to not waver with my confidence
traded my soul to free my mind, carmex to help me pass the time
can i go back to being blind
asked myself why one too many times

and i know this
i can t read it right, between the fights
i still need you
and i know this
i fell for your eyes, i just realized
i still need you
i still need you

i tried to say thank you, but i don't know if you heard me
i know it wasn't your plan, to just be the one to hurt me
my thoughts versus my feelings, my thoughts on you hit the ceiling
but my feelings aren't a real thing
if i feel things i don't really deserve

and i know this
i can t read it right, between the fights
i still need you
and i know this
i fell for your eyes, i just realized
i still need you
and i know this
i can t read it right, between the fights
i still need you
and i know this
i fell for your eyes, i just realized
i still need you
i still need you
i still need you
i still need you
i still need you


i don't need no one to follow, feathers full
get up early just to charm unwaking souls
when the sea called me
when the sea called me home

i can't swim, it's lucidity, so clear
i can't swim, it's lucidity, so clear
i can't swim, it's lucidity, so clear

it's no wonder they're shipping all my clothes
wear the fog, i'll forget the rules i've known
look in cloud's mirror
when the sea called me home


i can't swim, it's lucidity, so clear
i can't swim, it's lucidity, so clear
i can't swim, it's lucidity, so clear
i can't swim, it's lucidity, so clear

lets keep it chasing
our little secret is the space between us melting
i think it's happening
devise a solid plan
it's gonna run loose
a sudden short fuse
i never thought that this was something
we could ever choose
i know i'll come to
we've got the upper hand
and it runs real deep to a closer fit
at a slight degree
one could glisten over it, and if i
never told them nothing
then they wouldn't have hell to pay
'cause we dwell so hard on the slightest touch
and i ran so far
just to miss something so much
and so i never would have said it
if they saw me yesterday
another place to go?
i didn't think so
beating on the marble counterfeit
a no show
you wanna head home
we've got some work to do
i signal same lines
when jimmi seems fine
the combination of embracing
all our past times
see into my mind
i want to smother you
and it runs real deep to a closer fit
at a slight degree
one could glisten over it, and if i
never told them nothing
then they wouldn't have hell to pay
'cause we dwell so hard
on the slightest touch
and i ran so far
just to miss something so much
and so i never would have said it
if they saw me yesterday
you know me
fists clinched in an altercation
and i'm screaming in my dreams like
it's going in and out of fashion
so put your face up
you're pretty lovable
and it runs real deep to a closer fit
at a slight degree
one could glisten over it, and if i
never told them nothing
then they wouldn't have hell to pay
'cause we dwell so hard on the slightest touch
and i ran so far
just to miss something so much
and so i never would have said it
if they saw me yesterday

i'm thinking of you
won't you stay off my mind?
whatever i do
i'm down when i'm high

you taught me to feel
something i knew but didn't believe
i see the universe changing when your hands are touching me
and you, you are a dream
make me a fool 'fore you leave
the world is not as exciting in my head, honestly

i'm thinking of you
won't you stay off my mind?
whatever i do
i'm down when i'm high
'cause you're still on my mind
 'cause you're still on my mind 
just stay off my mind

you give me the feels of strawberry fields
that's all i can see
a love like this has no ending, stuck on a loop
consuming me
and when lights are fading, lovers playing
boring on a sunday
fairy lights are hanging from the trees
there's something about it, i'm lost in the crowd
still, i don't know
boy, it's like i'm standing here alone

i'm thinking of you
won't you stay off my mind?
whatever i do
i'm down when i'm high
'cause you're still on my mind
 'cause you're still on my mind 
just stay off my mind

when the ice is melting, cars are waiting
somehow it's monday and everyone has somewhere else to be
im left with the silence
there's something about it, i don't know
i don't mind just sitting here alone
'cause you're still on my mind

i'm thinking of you
won't you stay off my mind?
whatever i do
i'm down when i'm high
'cause you're still on my mind

i'm thinking of you
won't you stay off my mind?

if i could save time in a bottle
the first thing that i'd like to do
is to save every day till eternity passes away
just to spend them with you
if i could make days last forever
if words could make wishes come true
i'd save every day like a treasure and then
again, i would spend them with you
but there never seems to be enough time
to do the things you want to do, once you find them
i've looked around enough to know
that you're the one i want to go through time with
if i had a box just for wishes
and dreams that had never come true
the box would be empty, except for the memory of how
they were answered by you
but there never seems to be enough time
to do the things you want to do, once you find them
i've looked around enough to know
that you're the one i want to go through time with

i've got a cold heart and cold hands
i'll make you wanna be where i am
if you only knew my plans
oh if you only knew who i am
normally i break your heart
i love every minute, tear you apart
late at night i lie awake
just thinking about your pretty face
i've got a cold heart and cold hands
i'll make you wanna be where i am
if you only knew my plans
oh if you only knew who i am
normally i break your heart
i love every minute, tear you apart
late at night i lie awake
just thinking about your pretty face
i'll never leave you on the wire
so let me touch your fire
i'm cold, sick and i'm tired
so baby let me touch your fire
i'll never leave you on the wire
so baby let me touch your fire

walking scott street, feeling like a stranger
with an open heart, open container
i've got a stack of mail and a tall can
it's a shower beer it's a payment plan

there's helicopters over my head
every night when i go to bed
spending money and i earned it
when i'm lonely, that's when i'll burn it

do you feel ashamed
when you hear my name

i asked you "how is your sister?
i heard she got her degree"
and i said, "that makes me feel old"
you said, "what does that make me?"

i asked you "how is playing drums?"
you said it's too much shit to carry
"and what about the band?"
you said they're all getting married

do you feel ashamed
when you hear my name

anyway, don't be a stranger
anyway, don't be a stranger
don't be a stranger


today i talked to a semi stranger
a girl that i sorta know
but every encounter at the corner grocery
holds potential for our relationship to grow
and half of my brain was totally afraid
that she d hate me, never want to see me again
and half of my brain was equally afraid
that she d like me, want to be my friend

i am learning to love
i am learning to let myself be loved

how did i miss this lesson when i was young?
how did i miss this lesson when i was young?
how did i miss this lesson when i was young?

yesterday i was anxious and alone
so i called a friend to make me feel okay
and for a moment, i found myself angry at him for offering help
when i should have just been grateful for what he gave

i am learning to love
i am learning to let myself be loved

how did i miss this lesson when i was young?
how did i miss this lesson when i was young?
how did i miss this lesson when i was young?

be gentle with me
i might not be ready
be gentle with me
i might not be ready

i am learning to love
i am learning to let myself be loved

how did i miss this lesson when i was young?
how did i miss this lesson when i was young?
how did i miss this lesson when i was young?

and even after all this time
just know you've got nothing to hide
it's okay to cry  it's okay to cry 
it's okay to cry  it's okay to cry

and i saw the magazine you were reading
and i read the page
and if i had just one single wish
wish i could have said this
it's okay to cry

and even after all this time
just know you've got nothing to hide

i wanna know what it feels like
it's okay to cry  it's okay to cry 
i wanna go there with you
it's okay to cry  it's okay to cry 
'cause we've all got a dark place
it's okay to cry  it's okay to cry 
maybe if we shine some light there
it's okay to cry  it's okay to cry 
it won't be so hard
it's okay to cry  it's okay to cry 
i want to know those parts of you

i, was that a teardrop in your eye?
i never thought i'd see you cry
just know whatever hurts, it's all mine
it's okay to cry  it's okay to cry 
i can see the truth through all the lies
and even after all this time
whatever it is, just know it's alright
it's okay to cry  it's okay to cry 
it's okay to cry  it's okay to cry

kissed you in the park
we'll meet up after dark
in your car with the backseat, southern summer
ignored all the missed calls from your mother
and kiss me in the park
we'll meet up after dark
and we'll talk until morning hits the windshield
and paints yellow lines on the field

now you want to start
with someone not so far
oh she's bubbly and sweet like a coca cola
i watch from my drink as you look her over
the tab don't pop too hard
you're sick of playing cards
with your love, you want warmth and i'm somethin' colder
i'm putting your hands to her heart

i don't think of my life
anywhere but in your arms tonight
won't say it this time
can't even look back in your eyes

kissed you in the park
we'll meet up after dark
it's a bite of the apple, the touch of your lips
i'm stuck in the bathroom and sick over it
'cause you're made from the stars
that we watched from your car
and i'm just a victim of changing planets
my scorpio rising and my parents

i don't think of my life
anywhere but in your arms tonight
won't say it this time
can't even look back in your eyes


it's getting cold in california
getting colder in new york
and everybody's hanging lights up
everybody 'round the world

oh, this year, i don't feel quite like i used to
december came, something changed
guess my wish came true
just like home, not alone
winter's not so blue
my first winter with you

another chair around the table
another gift under the tree
another song about the season
but they all sound new to me

oh, this year, i don't feel quite like i used to
december came, something changed
guess my wish came true
just like home, not alone
winter's not so blue
my first winter with you

ooh, ooh
ooh, ooh

oh, this year, i don't feel quite like i used to
december came, something changed
guess my wish came true
just like home, not alone
winter's not so blue
my first winter with you


i won't wait this time
no, not now, not again
not much longer
heavy weight works my
mind all night it's so hard
not to ponder

let's make it last forever
'cause the night's still young
it's true, i feel the pressure
every time you're gone
as long as we're together
this moment lasts forever

and what will she say
would my heart be torn?
maybe the same helps to keep her warm
maybe she's too shy to comment
twenty one and too hard to call it

let's make it last forever
'cause the night's still young
it's true, i feel the pressure
every time you're gone
as long as we're together
this moment lasts forever

let's make it last forever
'cause the night's still young
it's true, i feel the pressure
every time you're gone
as long as we're together
this moment lasts forever


in the flood we flock
we're pulling our weight till we rest above
and the breath, it s enough

through my blood you run
pushed in a pace till the feelings' numb
give me rest, i'll succumb

you re giving me something
something when i feel nothing
when night falls and cold sets in
keep letting the sun in
sun in, 'cause something's coming
that i can't face alone

ooo...

now i'm in the heart of the heat
there's so much
somewhere amongst the cold winter air
and i float without care

you're all that i need
drew cold out of me
you slow down the speed
and move free



"hey, you're the comeback kid"
see me look away, i'm the runaway
i'm the stay out late, i'm recovering
kid at the top of our street
i was somewhat like him, i was somebody

comeback kid
comeback kid
come back, kid
let me look at you

"yeah, you're the comeback kid
let me look at you"
then look away
yeah, i'm the runaway, i'm the hardly stay

watch me run away

"kid came back a real turn around"
please believe that i want to stay
"got a job now that my brother found
working nights just a mile away"
don't let me slip away, i'm not a runaway
it just feels that way

comeback kid
comeback kid
come back, kid
let me look at you
comeback kid
comeback kid
come back


i'm covered in soot
we re running for gondolas
and when i come home again my arms will wrap around my friends
when i come home again my arms will wrap around my friends
i'm covered in soot
i'm covered in skin
and when i go to leave again i ll wear the clothes you put me in
and when i go to leave again i'll wear the clothes you put me in

could i be coming home with the waves rolling back?
could i be coming home with the waves rolling back?
could i be coming home with the waves rolling back?
could i be coming home with the waves rolling back?

oh why?
oh why did i go outside with the bitches on the trail
oh why?
oh why did i go?
i don't know
only thing i can think to say is
get on the train, get on the train
and ride it 'til you come, ride it 'til you come
get on the train, get on the train
and ride it 'til you come, ride it 'til you come

like the bass child
like the river wild
like the tide coming in again
we're driving in the van
through dotted lines we re making friends
with all the other bands
driving to make their fortunes
could i be coming home with the waves rolling back?
could i be coming home with the waves rolling back?
could i be coming home with the waves rolling back?
could i be coming home with the waves rolling back?
could be coming home

we re chasing the glow
a pack of wolves
we're running from home to home
blindly searching for what we know
a dream created from the videos
our feet are getting raw
but our mouths still quietly
sing the song
keeping time to piston rods
we re feeding ourselves on steam exhaust

oh why?
oh why do i run like the wolf each time my roots peak out from tender foot?
oh why
oh why can't i just kiss my lips enough
be happy with just making love?
could i be could i be could be
o why?
oh why
did i go outside with the bitches on the trail
oh why
oh why
did i go?
i don't know only thing i can think to say is
get on the train
get on the train
and ride it till you come
ride it till you come
or could i just
get on the train  oh why 
get on the train
and ride it till you come
aide it till you come
get on the train   oh why 
get on the train
and ride it till you come
ride it till you come
get on the train   oh why 
get on the train
and ride it till you come
ride it till you come

i will echo every word you say about tomorrow
even when i can't see what you
even when i can't see what you do

damn you got me, got me speechless, speechless
you got me hooked on your fingertips, baby
every time the pressure gets to me
you got me hooked 'cause damn, you got me speechless
oh you got me on the edge of tonight with you

i told you once that i would never think twice
cause i know you got me, got me

with you, i'll go even if it's not my aspiration
i think about you only, only, think about you only, only
they say that you're toxic and you're flowing through my bloodstream
but i don't care what they say, i say we are in our own world anyway

damn you got me, got me speechless, speechless

i told you once that i would never think twice

i'm in your custody
but i'm not a criminal, i can be your next big thing
look at what i've become
silly little monster, should've just held my tongue

i hate the feeling of this weight upon my shoulders
pushing the pressure down on me
you think you want the best for me but nothing really matters
if you force it, it won't come, i guess i'm feeling
numb
i guess i'm feeling
numb

sometimes i wish i could fly
through a secret trap door, into another life  life 
bury my head in the sand
i don't want to grow up, la la la la la la la

i hate the feeling of this weight upon my shoulders
pushing the pressure down on me
you think you want the best for me but nothing really matters
if you force it, it won't come, i guess i'm feeling
numb
i guess i'm feeling
numb

i'll play the game, i'll do everything you tell me
all the losers win in the end
i'll play the game, i'll do anything you tell me
all the losers win in the end

i hate the feeling of this weight upon my shoulders
pushing the pressure down on me
you think you want the best for me but nothing really matters
if you force it, it won't come, i guess i'm feeling
numb
i guess i'm feeling
numb
i guess i'm feeling numb
i guess i'm feeling
numb


i hope you find your way
sorry we couldn't make it
still, i miss you anyway, yeah
i just grew and couldn't break it

how i wish perfect was enough
for my own heart

for my own heart

for our own heart

hard to explain when you feel your world's on fire
close my eyes to all the things that hurt my nature
i apologize, but i am
apologize, but i am
apologize, but i am

i'm tired of holdin' my head up
i'm tired of tryin' to hold onto you
this cycle, fighting and making up
i'm tired of tryin' to hold on

everything is fallin' apart, slippin' away
there's no rewindin' the things we say
everything is fallin' apart, slippin' away
no way to fight it

i'll break, breakaway
break, breakaway
i'll break, breakaway
break, breakaway
i'll break

the ground and the ceilin' seem to be disappearing
nothin' to stand on, oh god, i hate this feelin'
you put the weight of your world down on my shoulders
why'd you have to make me older?
make me older, make me older

i'm tired of holdin' my head up

we've been there, not much longer
i don't understand and i don't want to yet
we've been scared, but i won't fight it
i'm underprepared and uninvited

now i think we're s.o.l., s.o.l
everything you say is wrong, i can't tell, i can't
and now we got it so bad, you're so bad, i won't heal
and when i finally get gone, i won't feel, i won't

ooh, don't hurry, don't rush
tell me can you prove you'll hurt me as much?
i know exactly what you want
all it only takes is once
ooh, can you give me enough?
ooh, ooh, ooh

i'm a disease and they can't cure it
please don't scrape your knees when you fall for it
you're too weak and if i gave you every piece of me
you couldn't take it

now i think we're s.o.l., s.o.l
everything you say is wrong, i can't tell, i can't
and now we got it so bad, you're so bad, i won't heal
and when i finally get gone, i won't feel, i won't

ooh, don't hurry, don't rush

i've been looking for a long shot
i've been aiming high
guess i've always known
i'd be looking on my own
but for a second thought i found it tonight
ooh, ooh oooh

you said i was a long shot
you were probably right
and i don't wanna leave
but i got places i wanna be
and this heavy love, i gotta leave behind

oh, don't you think too much
no, there's nobody else and i'm still in love
but, ooh, i've got my mind made up
it's cruel i gotta choose
between you or a long shot
or a long shot

there's champagne in the green room
it's been a hell of a ride
but is it still a toast if i'm drinking all alone?
here's to wishing you were with me tonight

oh, don't you think too much
no, there's nobody else and i'm still in love
but, ooh, i've got my mind made up
it's cruel i gotta choose
between you or a long shot
or a long shot, or a long shot
or a long shot, or a long shot

are you awake?
is it too late to be calling you up?
'cause i'm afraid
what i gained
don't outweigh the love we lost
the love we lost

oh, don't you think too much
if there's nobody else and you're still in love
oh, lately i feel stuck
i had to call you up
i had to call you up

oh, don't you think too much
no, there's nobody else and i'm still in love
but, oh, i've got my mind made up
it's cruel i gotta choose
between you or a long shot
or a long shot, or a long shot
or a long shot


so let me keep the last piece of my heart
before you tear it all apart
just let me keep the last piece of my heart
before you tear it all apart

you packed the bag
i guess that your mind is made up
you take a dreg off of the cigarette you said you're quitting now
take a step back, when all i want is to hold you
drive away fast
this ain't the movie scene i thought we'd be in, nah

you, oo ooh
you, oo ooh
lost myself to you

so let me keep the last piece of my heart
before you tear it all apart
just let me keep the last piece of my heart
before you tear it all apart

you cut your hair, remember how i used to love it
now i gotta stamp the boxes of shit that i thought we could fix
and i wanna be fair
but then i'd be working for nothing
then you drive away
blasting the music that we used to make out to

you, oo ooh
you, oo ooh
lost myself to you

so let me keep the last piece of my heart
before you tear it all apart
just let me keep the last piece of my heart
before you tear it all apart

 so let me keep 
you, oo ooh
you, oo ooh
lost myself to you
 so let me 
you, oo ooh
you, oo ooh
lost myself to you

you left your smokes by the window
i'm gonna wait by the door
somewhere in me, i got some hope
a hope that you find what you're looking for

so let me keep the last piece of my heart
before you tear it all apart
just let me keep the last piece of my heart
before you tear it all apart
so let me keep the last piece of my heart
 you, oo ooh, you, oo ooh 
before you tear it all apart  lost myself to you 
just let me keep the last piece of my heart
 you, oo ooh, you, oo ooh 
before you tear it all apart  lost myself to you 


when the fever's gone
and the road's to dust
i touch down sunday
to tie the loose ends up
with a pocket full of
that gypsy stuff
i heard you calling me, calling me, calling me
through the dissonance
i've been known to run
just to feel the rush
but the dying sun
illuminates so much

it's hard to see beyond what's in sight
but when you tilt the light i realize

for 1000 nights
i've been a restless soul
just wasting time
digging up fool's gold
it took a 1000 lives
being on my own
for me to find
it was all fool's gold

 find 
you ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
you ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

i've felt the fever on
but couldn't taste the fruit
there's a bulletproof bond
between meaning and you

it's hard to see beyond what's in sight
but when you tilt the light i realize

for 1000 nights
i've been a restless soul
just wasting time
digging up fool's gold
it took a 1000 lives
being on my own
for me to find
it was all fool's gold

 find 
you ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
you ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
 find 
you ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
you ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
ooh ooh

it was all dead end roads, heaven knows
it was all dead end roads, heaven knows

it's hard to see beyond what's in sight
or when you tilt the light i realize

for 1000 nights
i've been a restless soul
just wasting time
digging up fool's gold
it took a 1000 lives
being on my own
for me to find
it was all fool's gold

 without 
you ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
you ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
 without 
you ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
you ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
ooh ooh

ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

in this very room
we spent the day and looked over antiquities
don't you remember?
i can't recall this face, but i want to, but i want to
in this very room
we flew across the sea
 i can't remember your face
but i hope that ship will carry us back 
in the ship saturnia
don't you remember?
i can't recall this face, but i want to
remember your face but i want to
but i know the ship will carry us there
will carry us, will carry us there
i can't recall this face
i can't recall this face, but i want to, but i want to
i don't remember when
but i hope we meet again in the same room
in the same room
in the same room


you told me i would never see you walk away
said you'd never break my heart
never leave me in the dark

you're a holiday
a glass of ocean slipping down my throat
and landing on my hopes, i'm dreaming
off the maps, no hidden grids, i'm fleeing
i worship you like holy days
lying on my back, seeing clouds and rays
drinking lime and bitter from my lemonade
white horses, maritime won't do

do you remember?
the holiday slipped away
time and place
i definitely remember
lying on my back and seeing clouds and rays
we're dreaming with feelings, whoa
forever we're young
pages unsung, ooh
i feel that you remember
dreaming of a past that couldn't last
but now we're changing
refraining

i'm thinkin it's the, know that it's the
i'm thinkin it's the bad, bad blood
i'm thinkin it's the, know that it's the
i'm thinkin it's the bad, bad blood

do you remember?
the riding, the passion, the falling over
and tripping on ice
sharing advice, taking it twice
but let us not forget the
silent days, stripped away
time and place
oh, you choose not to remember
fly away and counting days
i'm hiding from you, ooh

i'm thinkin it's the, know that it's the
i'm thinkin it's the bad, bad blood
i'm thinkin it's the, know that it's the
i'm thinkin it's the bad, bad blood

i choose
for the rain not to fall
exposing the soil on you
i lose
don't tell me i'm cuckoo, i know
and it's mad, we were close, oh
i choose
my head's now afloat
but my heart's drowning boats of you
i lose
don't tell me i'm coo coo
coo coo coo coo coo coo ooh ooh

i'm thinkin it's the, know that it's the
i'm thinkin it is the bad, bad blood
i'm thinkin it is the, know that it's the
i'm thinkin it is the bad, bad blood
i'm thinkin it's the, know that it's the
i'm thinkin it is the bad, bad blood
i'm thinkin it is the, know that it's the
i'm thinkin it is the bad, bad

sorry, my headphones fell off 


somewhere in the south of france
or the caribbean sea
she said "i don't need to make a living
fake diamonds got nothing on me"
i met her in the world below
she's a tourist of the world beneath
i said "everything i built from nothing"
she said "i'm so rich, everything's free"

so dark
it ain't so dark
so dark
it ain't so dark

forever and never
a torch in search of a flame
to be good, get better
well i've been feeling this way
forever and never
a night in search of a day
as anxious as ever
it's such a dark, dark, dark saturday

what's your name and where you from?
well i'm worth your weight in gold
while we lie here in the sun
the whole wide world's about to explode
now our bodies intertwine
and the truth is plain to see
i said "everything i built from nothing"
she said "don't you blame your problems on me"

so dark
it ain't so dark
so dark
it ain't so dark
so dark
it ain't so dark

forever and never
a torch in search of a flame
to be good, get better
i change by staying the same
forever and never
a night in search of a day
as anxious as ever
it gets so dark, dark, dark

i suppose i should tell you
what this bitch is thinking
you'll find me in the studio
and not in the kitchen
i won't be bragging 'bout my cars
or talking 'bout my chains
don t need to shake my ass for you
'cause i've got a brain
if i told you 'bout my sex life
you'd call me a slut
when boys be talking 'bout their bitches
no one's making a fuss
there's a glass ceiling to break, uh huh
there's money to make
and now it s time to speed it up
'cause i can't move at this pace

i'll go ahead and say them anyway

if you're not a size six
then you're not good looking
well, you better be rich
or be real good at cooking
you should probably lose some weight
'cause we can't see your bones
you should probably fix your face
or you'll end up on your own
don't you want to have somebody who objectifies you?
have you thought about your butt; who's gonna tear it in two?
we've never had it so good, uh huh
we're out of the woods
and if you can't detect the sarcasm
then you've misunderstood

sometimes, it's hard to find the words to say
i'll go ahead and say them anyway
forget your balls and grow a pair of tits
it's hard, it's hard
it's hard out here for a bitch

it's hard for a bitch  for a bitch

let's face the truth
sooner or later, no matter what somebody has to lose
i'll be on the road and you're going to school down in baton rouge
and i promise you the world my love, but what's the use?
but what's the use?
i can't explain how it feels like we have it all
when everything's bound to change
i'm fearing that i lose my place inside of your picture frames
and i promise you the world, my love, but we can't stay

tonight, we're saying goodbye, chain smoking cigarettes
we lie, pretend it's alright
i say you'll always be mine, don't know what happens next
we'll find some way to get by, one day at a time

i know it's hard
i'm dreading the moment i see you pack all that shit in your car
when one of us walks out the door all alone with a broken heart
so let's make the most of this moment before it all falls apart, yeah

whatever's meant to be, just hold your head up  hold your head up 
no matter where we go, i'm on your side  on your side 
let's not make it out like we are fed up  we're not fed up 
there's just no controlling when it's time, so

tonight, we're saying goodbye, chain smoking cigarettes
we lie, pretend it's alright
i say you'll always be mine, don't know what happens next
we'll find some way to get by, one day at a time

baby, baby, leave for the road
you don't need my permission to go on your own
so don't act crazy and turn around when you realize
the future's hazy, just keep that piece of shit in drive

tonight, we're saying goodbye, chain smoking cigarettes
we lie, pretend it's alright
i say you'll always be mine, don't know what happens next
we'll find some way to get by, one day at a time
tonight, we're saying goodbye, chain smoking cigarettes
we lie, pretend it's alright
i say you'll always be mine, don't know what happens next
we'll find some way to get by, one day at a time


i'm tryin' to hold my breath
let it stay this way
can't let this moment end
you set off a dream in me
getting louder now
can you hear it echoing?

take my hand
will you share this with me?
'cause darling, without you

all the shine of a thousand spotlights
all the stars we steal from the night sky
will never be enough, never be enough
towers of gold are still too little
these hands could hold the world, but it'll
never be enough, never be enough for me

never, never
never, never
never, for me, for me
never enough, never enough, never enough
for me, for me, for me

all the shine of a thousand spotlights
all the stars we steal from the night sky

these are the moments i'm missing
these are the moments i'm missing

i had a dream
i had a dream when i was only five
to work at a bar
i wanted to see over the other side
and i had a friend
her name was fern and she had a blue bike
so we'd ride through the streets
i would sleep over on saturday nights

then i went to school
my family moved to a village nearby
at thirteen years old
i started drawing black under my eyes
cause i met a boy
first time i kissed him, well it was the last
cause i got afraid
when everyone there started moving too fast

these are the moments i'm missing
these are the moments i never took in when
i was just standing there wishing
i could grow up and my life would be different
these are the moments i'm missing
these are the moments
these are the moments i'm missing
these are the moments

i've been so caught in the motions
forgetting right where my home is
these are the moments i'm missing

in the back of her mum's car
on the way to the old bars, yeah
raising my anxiety
using her sisters id, yeah
in a skin tight short skirt
sixteen and we danced till our feet hurt
but i had a dream
i had a goal
got a guitar
and a camera phone

then over the time
i started racking up numbers online
at the end of july
i met somebody who changed my life
then i was signed
and falling in love for the very first time
but that fucked me up
so then i had issues with falling in love

these are the moments i'm missing
there are the moments i never took in when
i was just standing there wishing
i could grow up and my life would be different
these are the moments i'm missing
these are the moments
these are the moments i'm missing
these are the moments

i've been so caught in the motions
forgetting right where my home is
these are the moments i'm missing
now these are the moments i'm missing

born in the snow, nothing there for me
i had to let go, found the world on my own
wandering, looking for where to call home
with a beat up guitar and a bunch of highways to endlessly roam
never did have a car, but i got a few friends to help me along
then i met a few girls in the city of angels
thought they all were the one, but they all ran away
so i've been writing these songs
all about love and about finding home
i'm alone, i don't know where to go, all i know is...

these are the moments i'm missing

cos i've been so caught in the motions
forgotten right where my home is
these are the moments i'm missing
cos i've been so caught in the motions
forgotten where my home is

these are the moments i'm missing
these are the moments i'm missing
these are the moments i'm missing

when i say that we will never return to closing doors

sleep tight in a new light
through another warning call
look down on the cold ground
i will try to break the fall

i feel it
moving in another direction we call our own
and i won't chase
anyone who ever believed in what they stole
i need it
so i hold onto every peace of mind that i chose
and i don't lie
when i say that we will never return to closing doors

sleep tight in a new light
through another warning call
look down on the cold ground
i will try to break the fall

say you'll remember
to keep it all inside
you can run for the skyline
your eyes open wide
say you'll remember
to keep it all inside
you can run for the skyline
your eyes open wide

 it's a memory, it's a memory 
don't look away 'cause when we see it we are closer
 it's a memory, it's a memory 
don't look away 'cause when we see it we are near
 it's a memory, it's a memory 

say you'll remember
to keep it all inside
you can run for the skyline
your eyes open wide
say you'll remember
to keep it all inside
you can run for the skyline
your eyes open wide

now here's a story bout a woman with dreams
so picture perfect at thirteen, an ebony queen
beneath the surface it was more than just a crooked smile
nobody knew about her secret so it took a while
i could see a tear fall slow down her black cheek
sheddin quiet tears in the back seat; so when she asked me
"what would you do if it was you?"
couldn't answer such a horrible pain to live through
i tried to trade places in the tragedy
i couldn't picture three crazed niggas grabbin me
for just a moment i was trapped in the pain, lord come and take me
four niggas violated, they chased and they raped me
even though it wasn't me, i could feel the grief
thinkin with your brains blown that would make the pain go
no  you got to find a way to survive
cause they win when your soul dies

wasting all my time wondering if you really loved me
i was wasting all my time thinking 'bout the way you treat me
wasting all my time on someone who didn't know me
i was wasting all my time on someone who couldn't love me

and i knew when i met you
i'm not the one you wanna be with
'cause i can't see you blossom in the future that i'm dreamin'

i'll be spending all my time
with someone who really wants me
i'll be spending all my time
with someone who really needs me
'cause i found someone who has time
to show me they really love me
so i'm not wasting any time
even though he's still far from me

and i knew when i met him
that he's the one i want to be with
'cause i can see him
blossom in the future that i'm dreamin'
so it's not wasting any time

i won t leave it 'til i find my way
this moment never been so important
can t find all the words that i wanted
so i gotta sit and wait for it to all come together


lying in bed
and you're circling 'round my head
try to picture something different instead of this
pretend i don't exist
a paradigm shift
i was never here at all

and they said that we'd get on
i didn't think it would take so long
before you took me away from
everything else, took me out of myself
i'm gone  gone 

we don't touch anymore
but we talk all the time so it's fine
can somebody tell me what i want?
'cause i keep changing my mind
i can see a progression
and i guess it's happening
a different direction
and i guess it's happening

shall we start again?
what do you want to do then?
going over and over
growing older and older
let's think this through
what do you want to do?
and your chin's on my shoulder
and you're turning me over

we don't fuck anymore
but we talk all the time so it's fine
can somebody tell me what i want?
'cause i keep changing my mind
i can see a progression
and i guess it's happening
a different direction
and i guess it's happening

somebody tell me what i want  want 

we don't fuck anymore
but we talk all the time so it's fine
can somebody tell me what i want?
'cause i keep changing my mind
i can see a progression
and i guess it's happening
a different direction

we could be soulmates

lately i don't know what i'm supposed to do
'cause i got someone, and baby, so do you

was the hot, hot night, we were having a barbecue
and i said "hi", you said "hi", baby, that's when i knew
i just, i just can't, can't take my mind off you
it was a night to remember, we were hanging up on the roof
someone got knocked out and in came the boys in blue
and you said "bye", i said "bye", some of that made the news
i just, i just can't, can't take my mind off you

one night on the rooftop
one night on the rooftop, rooftop
one sight at the rooftop

then the rain came, something caught flame, and it was crazy

sparks fly on the rooftop
friends fight on the rooftop, rooftop
bright lights at the rooftop
at the rooftop, rooftop

we could be soulmates
we could be so great
we could be happy
one day, some day

it was the 3rd of september, we were hanging up on the roof

we ain't breathin' lately
no tomorrow, not for you and i
hate it, i hate it
can't believe i'm sayin' it
call my friends and tell 'em we had died

our love, our love, our love
it is gone now
our love, our love, our love
took everything we had
our love, our love, our love
was real, i felt that
but it ain't comin' back
no, it ain't comin' back

i wish you everything you've ever wanted in your life
this tastes so bittersweet, it's like i'm goin' under
burn all the letters, all of my secrets, things only you know
bury my heart six feet under, throw us a funeral
i wish you everything you've ever wanted in your life

faded, get faded
only thing that makes sense
anything to take the pain away
complicated, but i wanted us to make it
i was praying, waitin' for a change

our love, our love, our love
it is gone now
our love, our love, our love
took everything we had
our love, our love, our love
was real, i felt that
but it ain't comin' back
no, it ain't comin' back

i wish you everything you've ever wanted in your life
this tastes so bittersweet, it's like i'm goin' under
burn all the letters, all of my secrets, things only you'd know
bury my heart six feet under, throw us a funeral
i wish you everything you've ever wanted in your life

burn all the letters, all of my secrets

say your last, say your last
say your last goodbye
say your last, say your last
say your last goodbye


i've been knocked down, i've been lost
with a ground shaking under my feet
i gave it all to someone who'd said, "fire, run"
i've been, i've been through the days
when bright love turns into hate
you bend, and you bend 'til you break
'til the lights are gone

when the one you care for just takes it all
washing you down like a waterfall
you lose the way and you hit the wall
i'll be the one, i'll be the one, i'll be the one to

carry you home
when it hurts like you've crashed from above
heal your broken bones
when you can't move and your heart's still locked up
you rise, you rise, you rise
sometimes you need someone to carry you home
when it hurts like you've crashed from above
when it's true love

i ve been knocked down on my own
with waters too deep and too cold
sleepless so many nights
with a broken heart running wild

when the one you care for just takes it all
washing you down like a waterfall  like a waterfall 
you lose the way and you hit the wall
i'll be the one, i'll be the one, i'll be the one to

carry you home
when it hurts like you've crashed from above
heal your broken bones
when you can t move and your heart s still locked up
oh, you rise, you rise, you rise
sometimes you need someone to carry you home
when it hurts like you've crashed from above
when it's true love

when it's true love
when it's true love, whoa

the type when your life is deep into the ground
the only one i'm thinking of, you know this
so why you wanna fight now?
if you know i'm giving my best
then fill in the rest and slow your pace down
the tears try to fall, i won't let them down

a promise we made to do it our way
we're not in a race, you're running away
tomorrow we break, it's like an earthquake
and then we go 'round

we leave it behind just to bring it on back
it's not a breakup, it's just a breakdown

tar on the road held the heat of the day
craving the danger as on it we lay
clothes like cling fim on your back
caught in the swelter like it's a trap
dizzier then we're spiraling down
our time is all spent cause i'm spending it now
tar on the road held the heat of day
you're holding it in you say you're okay

and i believe you
cause nothing else could get much better
i believe you
feeling like we're at the equator
i see you
keeping to yourself

stepping right in to find out we were blind
our vision was drowned by a burning sky
caught in the daze you wore so well
the hotter it got the less that i felt
treading the line of the land in the sea
shivering as we got up to our knees
it's colder than we thought it'd be
further south than we'd ever been

but i need you
it's hard to make you not forget
that we need you
after all this time i'm starting to see you
convince me that you're fine

i can see your collarbones and baby i'm scared
never thought i'd be so unprepared


...it's just not right, it's

i don't wanna be your girl no more, no more
i just wanna see your face at home, home, home

you can't do me right
so i... decide that

i don't wanna be your girl no more, no more
i just wanna see you up and out, out of the door, no

i'm not living right
so i... decide that

i don't wanna be your girl no more, no more

i won't hide the ways, i've tried
it's just not right
it's killing me tonight
so, so


is it really me you're missing?
or am i the only one who'll listen? mmm
all of these high hopes and low blows
i hope you know
just how much it hurts to believe you
i should cut this off, but i need you
i should help myself, but i can't help myself

is it really me you're missing?
or am i the only one who'll listen to you?
and if i pick up the phone tonight
will it be pieces by the morning?
am i the only number that you've tried?
or is it just another lonely night?

everybody tells me what i should've done now
'cause i only ever tell them when you're letting me down
oh, high hopes and low blows
i hope you know
just how much i've wanted to leave you
but there's nobody else that can be you
i should help myself

is it really me you're missing?
or am i the only one who'll listen to you?
and if i pick up the phone tonight
will it be pieces by the morning?
am i the only number that you've tried?
or is it just another lonely night?

is it really me?
and if you turn all the lights off
and put your hands on my body
could i be just anybody?  is it really me? 
and when you get what you wanted
is that the end of the story?
i know you'll never be sorry
until it's really me you're missing

is it really me you're missing?
or am i the only one who'll listen to you?
and if i pick up the phone tonight
will it be pieces by the morning?
am i the only number that you've tried?
or is it just another lonely night?

is it really me you're missing?
is it really me?
is it really me?

when i'm home
there is nothing i'm looking for
that you haven't already found
when i'm home
in the shallow water
you can swim around me
i won't mind

circling me underneath
the only one i'll ever need
eyes are moving in your sleep
and i wish i knew what you were watching

when everything goes quiet for a while
there's nothing left for us to reconcile
when everything goes quiet for a while
i'll meet you in the shallow water

i'm a fool
but at least you're foolish too
you're my crutch
but it's you that helps me to walk

drowning in a coral sea
the only place i'll ever be
eyes are moving in your sleep
and i wish i knew what you were watching

when everything goes quiet for a while
there's nothing left for us to reconcile
when everything goes quiet for a while
i'll meet you in the shallow water


i don't know how you do it
but somehow you always will be there
and there's nothing to it
but somehow you always understand
there's no way to wake up now
too many times i saw you cry
and no one can make up it
you wait for the sun to make the sky

and no one elevates you, elevates you now
and no one's gonna take you, gonna take you there

all this time, never thought i would see you smile
know that i and i know that i see you now
but i know i can't walk in
never go back again
no matter how, tonight i'll never go back, never go back again

and no one elevates you, elevates you now
and no one's gonna take you, gonna take you there
and no one elevates you, elevates you now
and no one's gonna take you, gonna take you there

you know that i want to get away
and i cannot wait for another day
you know that i want to elevate
time to pick it up and celebrate
you know that i want to get away
and i cannot wait for another day
you know that i want to elevate
time to pick it up and celebrate

what you want from me
is all of my time wasted on you
trying to teach me a lesson
well baby i learned one thing from you
you can try to be my hell, to be my beating
but every time i love myself, it hurts your feelings

so if i feel real good tonight
i'm gonna put it high on the loudspeaker
and if i feel like crying, i won't hide it
i am a loudspeaker
i am a loudspeaker
i am a loudspeaker

what you've done to me
well i've seen many a friend be silenced
thinking nobody would believe them
well baby you've got another thing coming
you can try to make me stop, call it delusion
but every time i don't shut up, it's revolution

so if i feel real good tonight
i'm gonna put it high on the loudspeaker
and if i feel like crying, i won't hide it
i am a loudspeaker
i am a loudspeaker
i am a loudspeaker

i don't know where the blame lies
but you better believe i'm not gonna carry it all
i don't know where the shame dies
but it's helping me to scream this is not my fault
i don't know where the blame lies
but you better believe i'm not gonna carry it all
i don't know where the shame dies
but it's helping me to scream this is not my fault
i don't know where the blame lies
but you better believe i'm not gonna carry it all
i don't know where the shame dies
but it's helping me to scream this is not my fault
but it's helping me to scream
not, not my fault

so if i feel real good tonight
i'm gonna put it high on the loudspeaker
if i feel like crying, i won't hide it
i am a loudspeaker


it's getting hard to tell exactly what it is
you just make me feel like there s something that i miss, somehow
so count me out

caught me on the floor, thought that i was crying
bet you think it's for you, i assure you that it's not about your world
can t help how i always feel about you
no sense trying to find a way around it
hard times, done trying

giving you my side eye
this would be my best side
i could never give up for you
i'm not here to make you feel good
giving you my side eye
this would be my best side
i could never give up for you
i'm not here to make you feel good

i was kinda lonely, had some time to kill
filling up my days with someone who i thought was too good to be the truth
can't help how i always feel about you
no sense trying to find a way around it
hard times, done trying

giving you my side eye
this would be my best side
i could never give up for you
i'm not here to make you feel good
giving you my side eye
this would be my best side
i could never give up for you
i'm not here to make you feel good

giving you my side eye
this would be my best side
i could never give up for you
i'm not here to make you feel good
giving you my side eye
this would be my best side
i could never give up for you
i'm not here to make you feel good

and we wonder what do you feel?
do we deserve your love
your attention and your sorrow
we're so primitive
it hurts

to let us feel?
try to relate in my state
and the aura around me says

to be here?

 verse 1 
spend a little too much time together
forgotten how to be all by ourselves
could be worse, yeah it could be better
stay inside beyond all others
help won t get me out of bed
stop the voices in my head
waste away with you instead alone, alone
the great inside and fortitude
safely home alone with you
wasting time but what a view you are
 pre chorus 
nobody told me when you love someone for real
that your mind s on hold and your heart s behind the wheel
 chorus 
i'm so caught up with you
slow love in solitude
don't eat and we drink too much
four walls and that one room love
we ll drift away again
you give me something to numb the pain
we don't talk and we keep the door shut
we re together just a little too much
 bridge 
i'll lay awake in the middle of the night thinking about home
feel so alone though i'm with you
not the same as i used to be
my friends all lost touch with me
and there's nobody to blame but myself

i feel like this is a bad one
racked up too many mistakes
thought you were in for the long run
now you're just another heartbreak

ooh, you don't know how this goes
if i'm being honest, yeah

it might take a little longer for us to be cool again
it might take a little longer for us to be cool again
i know i said that we'll be fine, but that was then, i guess i lied
it might take a little longer for us to be cool, cool, again
cool, cool again

had my heart for over three years
don't think you understand
probably take double that to see clear
keeping up ain't part of my plan

if one heart can mend another
only then can we begin
so won't you hold on a little longer?

yellow tinted lenses and a pink gelato
fallin' out the window, hit me back tomorrow
we'll always be the one tough act to follow
'cause we aiming for the stars with a point and hollow
i'm feeling these songs mocking jokes and 
i started this job selling rocks and arrows
'cause you only swipe right if you fuck for follows
welcome to the days of the broke and shallow

but if we just spoke, like we meant it
would you reference
this open part of me
the minute i know the time we spent in
came corrected, in my anatomy

matter over mind if we being honest
cus you wander through ya thoughts like a broken promise
in it for the monetary growth and power
but we divided at the bottom of this whiskey sour
so leave it on the table if ya' hot   bothered
 and  tell me if you mean it baby, who s the father
stories of a land you divide and conquer
you really showing me the meaning of a losing offer

but if we just spoke, like we meant it
would you reference
this open part of me
the minute i know the time we spent in
came corrected, in my anatomy


been a prisoner of the past
had a bitterness when i looked back
was telling everyone it's not that bad
 til all my shit hit the fan

i know i'm always like
telling everybody you don't gotta be a victim
life ain t always fair, but hell is living in resentment
choose redemption, your happy ending's up to you

i think it's time to practice what i preach
exorcise the demons inside me
whoa, gotta learn to let it go
the past can't haunt me if i don't let it
live and learn and never forget it
whoa, gotta learn to let it go

had a boogieman under my bed
putting crazy thoughts inside my head
always whispering, "it's all your fault"
he was telling me, "no, you're not that strong"

i know i'm always like
telling everybody you don t gotta be a victim
life ain t always fair, but hell is living in resentment
choose redemption, your happy ending's up to you

exorcise the demons inside me

live and learn and never forget it

i've been through hell and back
yeah, honestly, it's all made me who i am
holding on to wasted time
gotta learn to let go in life

so, i think it's time to practice what i preach
exorcise the demons inside me
whoa, gotta learn to let it go
the past can't haunt me if i don't let it
live and learn and never forget it
whoa, gotta learn to let it go

'cause i guess if i see you outside and you act like you're not mine i won't let myself forget
'cause every time, every time, every time i see you i know i'm not ready yet

no, i don't want somebody else, feels like i'm going through hell
so i just lie to myself just to prove

i'm not thinkin' 'bout you, you
i'm not thinkin' 'bout you, you
i don't wanna think about

you got me feeling things i swear that i have never felt
and you have a way with saying words that always stick around
and if i saw you outside hanging out with another guy like you're better off without
no, i would try, i would try, i would try to look away till i convince myself

no, i don't want somebody else, feels like i'm going through hell
so i just lie to myself just to prove

i'm not thinkin' 'bout you, you  oh

i wanna block it out, i don't wanna think about

you, you

i woke up with the sun in my chest
new kicks on, shining sunday best
blanket homes, and tight rope trees
dark roads will cool these warm bodies

push that bad down
wring that wash out
dreading the day that we begin to read into self doubt
steal that gut feel
and every cold thrill
let the salt sink in when everything is downhill

snap back to the youth in you
feel the done days and you're pulling through to the getting good, oh the getting good
close gaps in the winter stoop, when everybody lights up another hoop, that's the getting good. oh the getting good
snap back to the youth in you
feel the done days and you're pulling through to the getting good, oh the getting good
close gaps in the winter stoop, when everybody lights up another hoop, that's the getting good. oh the getting good


i broke good with every ounce of 'should'
the deep blue rising underneath my hood
your subtle shows, are what i don't need
i'm watching, i'm feelin'. make the best of me

push that bad down
wring that washout
dreading the day that we begin to read into self doubt
steal that gut feel
and every cold thrill
let the salt sink in when everything is downhill

snap back to the youth in you
feel the done days and you're pulling through to the getting good, oh the getting good
close gaps in the winter stoop, when everybody lights up another hoop, that's the getting good. oh the getting good

she know she got it
parties with her friends
and she goes out on fancy dates
she hides it
but there's another girl behind the diamonds and champagne
tonight she's downtown
cause all her uptown boys don't understand her anyway
and she's just dancing

to make the cold nights feel like summer days
to make the cold nights feel like summer days
to make the cold nights feel like summer days

she know she got it
she plays hard to get, but all these games get hard to play
and she posts pictures
of everywhere she goes when she goes on holiday
but tonight she's downtown
traded in the diamonds and champagne for chardonnay
and she's just dancing

to make the cold nights feel like summer days
to make the cold nights feel like summer days

to make the cold nights feel like summer days
to make the cold nights feel like summer days

and she's just dancing

i watched the fire burn down
i saw the smoke carry it away

but all this joy out of the ashes
i would've held on, but i got distracted
i guess i never thought
anything good could come from the dead and gone

let it go on
everyone else is having their fun
don't you get uptight, doesn't help none
guess i could get behind, get behind this
let it go on
everyone else is having their fun
don't you get uptight, doesn't help none
guess i could get behind, get behind this

i'm left staring in awe
so much life beyond my control
but it's better that way

but all this joy out of the ashes
i would've held on, but i got distracted
i guess i never thought
anything good could come from the dead and gone

let it go on
everyone else is having their fun
don't you get uptight, doesn't help none
guess i could get behind, get behind this
let it go on
everyone else is having their fun
don't you get uptight, doesn't help none
guess i could get behind, get behind this

i guess there's still a lot to learn
i know i've got a lot to learn

let it go on
everyone else is having their fun
don't you get uptight, doesn't help none

we know where all the red ferns grow
two feet against me, but beyond my reach
six keys, one whole heart for each, one whole wave for me
grass stains cut my bloody knees, it s goodpain it means i can t be phased
that little death inside my sides won t make it right
he wins every time i find myself inside, alone all night
i ll be howling keeping you between my eyes, there i ll be alright
i ll be howling keeping you between my eyes, there i ll be alright
rorschach the pieces that i lack
i felt stained, cold beneath the waves, behind my suchered face
cursed down, throw my certain doubt, let me let you down
that little death inside my sides won t make it right
he wins every time i find myself inside, alone all night
i ll be howling keeping you between my eyes, there i ll be alright
i ll be howling keeping you between my eyes, there i ll be alright


home is where i want to be
pick me up and turn me around
i feel numb, born with a weak heart
but i guess i must be having fun
the less we say about it the better
make it up as we go along
feet on the ground, head in the sky
it's okay, i know nothing's wrong, nothing

oh  i got plenty of time
oh  you got light in your eyes
and you're standing here beside me
i love the passing of time
never for money, always for love
cover up and say goodnight, say goodnight

home, is where i want to be
but i guess i'm already there
i come home, she lifted up her wings
i guess that this must be the place
i can't tell one from the other
i find you, or you find me?
there was a time before we were born
if someone asks, this is where i'll be, where i'll be oh 

we drift in and out
oh  sing into my mouth
out of all those kinds of people
you got a face with a view
i'm just an animal looking for a home and
share the same space for a minute or two
and you love me till my heart stops
love me till i'm dead
eyes that light up
eyes look through you
cover up the blank spots
hit me on the head i got ooh 


all of us girls, we're in and out of love
we're vulnerable, but we'll tell you that we're tough
some of these guys never think that they'll get caught
think that we're blind, but they're forgetting that we talk
 sing it with me 

if he never calls when he says he will
if he always tells you to keep it chill
if you see him out with another girl
baby, then you know he was never real
if he never wants you to meet his friends
if he ain't tagging you on the 'gram
take your heart and turn around while you still can

and tell him, tell him, tell him, tell him
"i got somewhere else to be"
and i don't, i don't, i don't, i don't
lose my head for nobody
yeah, if you have to question, "is he loyal to me?"
well then he's probably not and you should probably leave

says he's online, but he told you he's asleep
you stay inside like he never wants you to be seen
ain't got a job, no, says he 'models on the side'
swears you're the one, oh, but he's not the label type
 sing it with me 

if he never calls when he says he will
if he always tells you to keep it chill
if you see him out with another girl
baby, then you know he was never real
hope you never let those pictures send
he'll only go show them to his friends

four letter word just to get me along
it's a difficulty and i'm biting on my tongue
and i, i keep stalling, not keeping me together
people around got to find something to say now
holding back, every day the same
don't want to be a loner, listen to me, oh no
i never say anything at all
so with nothing to consider, they forget my name

they call me hell
they call me stacey
they call me her
they call me jane
that's not my name
that's not my name
that's not my name
that's not my name
they call me 'quiet' girl
but i'm a riot
mary jo lisa
always the same
that's not my name
that's not my name
that's not my name
that's not my name

i miss the catch if they throw me the ball
i'm the last drip standing up against the wall
keep up, falling, these heels they keep me boring
getting clamped up and sitting on the fence now
so alone all the time at night
lock myself away, listen to me, i'm not
though i'm dressed up out and all
with everything considered, they forget my name

they call me hell

this song was in my head
now it's in my mind
call it, reach it, get some words and get some timing
and though i realize
i cannot emphasize
i'll stick around but just don't promise, nothing binding
and baby, can't you see
that you're so desperately
a standing joker like a vocal one liner
instead of sing a long
this song is monotone
i've gotta get some soul, i gotta get some feeling
are you calling me darling?
are you calling me bird?
are you calling me darling?
are you calling me bird?

lightyears from everyone
stranded on a foreign sun
blacked out upon the edge
am i the only one out here?
dazed in the daytime light
floating in a violet sky
am i the only one
the only one around out here?

when open my eyes
i see someone i used to be
when i open my eyes
it's all coming back to me

come and take me lightyears
back to where we're from

forever you and i

ooh, ooh
 forever, you and i 
ooh, ooh
 'cause we're all made of 

lightyears from everyone
i wonder what i have i become?
washed up on a distant shore
no sign of me here no more

so fast, we're out of sight
moving at the speed of light
pumping our hearts in time
break through the atmosphere
so high that i can't see
it's all coming back to me

come and take me lightyears
back to where we're from
we could be together
that's where we belong
are you out there?
come and send me a sign
as long as we're together
we can glow
forever you and i

ooh, ooh
 forever, you and i 
ooh, ooh
 'cause we're all made of 

as long as we're together
we can make it if you're ready
as long as we're together we can glow
'cause we're all made of light
as long as we're together
we can make it if you're ready
as long as we're together we can glow
tell me, are you out there?
can you send me a sign?
as long as we're together

we can go all night 
as long as we're together
we can make it if you're ready
as long as we're together we can glow
 ooh, ooh 
move all night 
as long as we're together
we can make it if you're ready
as long as we're together we can glow
 ooh, ooh

only secret that she would keep
'til i saw her and she saw me, oh
everyday meeting on the sly

so say your worst
trust me your ignorance don't faze me

it goes against everything that you taught her
but i'm sorry miss, i'm in love with your daughter
you said, "what about kids? all the hopes i had for her?"
well i'm sorry miss, i'm in love with your daughter

can't believe you would break a heart
just to make sure that we're apart
not your life, but you'll get what you want
here's the part where we run away
me and her take the great escape
i don't care 'bout a thing you say, no

on my knees, all my life i ve been sold a chase
hustling hope for dollars, try cope a day  a day 

under condition
we on our way to the top
we got the world at our fingers
we make the penny drop
gotta get in and get outta the gate
i won't stop 'til i wake
i'll say it loud 'til i mean it
talk like i be the messiah

when i'm on top, i'm on top, i'm on top of the world
see me run, see me run, see me run with the girls
i'm on top, i'm on top, i'm on top of the world
need a break, then i'll take to the top of the world

on my knees, all my life i ve been sold a chase
hustling hope for dollars, try cope a day  a day 

euphoria
i missed you like a new treasure
we go so good together
search all my life to find better
but i won't hold my breath
i'll just fill up and deliver
they got attention deficit
i wait for the good lord to visit  mary, mary 

all my life turned to dust
no one knew who to trust
had a chance for a good life

see me on tele
see me on billboards and banners
see me white picket fences
now watch me build up my palace  ha ha ha 
now out on the run, you'll see me gathering martyrs
won't forget where i started when we would  pray from the gutters 

'cause i'm on top, i'm on top, i'm on top of the world
send me up, send me up with the diamonds and pearls
i'm on top, i'm on top, i'm on top of the world
and they can talk, they can talk, but i got the good word

and it's crazy, undefined, brand new
it's amazing i got high on a view
but tonight i'm feeling tired and alone
dear lord, i hope we didn't go wrong

i think i'm winning
feel like i might
feels like i'm in it
feel like a god
i'm in demand
they're on my time
one in a million
fought a good fight

on my knees, all my life i ve been sold a chase
hustling hope for dollars, try cope a day  a day 

we prayed from the gutters
like martyrs we followed you
prayed from the gutters
like martyrs we followed you

yeah, i'm on top, i'm on top, i'm on top of the world
 we pray from the gutters 
see me run, see me run, see me shout what i heard
 like martyrs, we followed you 
i'm gonna shine, i'm a shrine from the top of the world
 pray from the gutters, like martyrs we followed you 

on my knees, all my life i ve been sold a chase
hustling hope for dollars, try cope a day  a day 

uphill, i'm winning
not concerned if i'm cheating
they built me up to be beaten
they built me up to be beaten


damn
thought i was someone
thought we were something
it's always hard to understand
when every feeling
leaves with no reason
can't even balance no more
'cause i put all my weight on you

but you're gone
don't care how much i try
you're gone
and i'm not too surprised
you're gone
when you're all that's on my mind
you're gone
you're gone

damn
i poured the concrete
you laid the ceiling
and it hurts to tear it down
but our home is empty
and all of the memories
i keep trying to erase
but i spent all my change on you

but you're gone
don't care how much i try
you're gone
and i'm not too surprised
you're gone
when you're all that's on my mind
you're gone
you're gone

how did a feeling so strong
end up just feeling so wrong?
answers to questions i want

but you're gone
don't care how much i try
you're gone
and i'm not too surprised
you're gone
when you're all that's on my mind
you're gone
you're gone

you're gone

said i'm going too fast, so i slow it down a bit
like a time lapse, break me up now, bit by bit
telling you'll pass, i'mma love enough in this
and it's a lot less, to unravel this likely stitch
oh i'll see you and come right back to
got me too bad, you got me, you got me too bad
oh i'll see you and come right back to
got me too bad, you got me, you got me too bad
now we're growing alone, better this than holding hands
she got a complex, and she's breaking down as planned
and maybe i'll sigh, will that help you love me less?
it's how i get by, never could try to impress
oh i'll see you and come right back to
got me too bad, you got me, you got me too bad
oh i'll see you and come right back to
got me too bad, you got me, you got me too bad
and i wanna go home, back to blankets overhead
but clicking heels can't, get me out of my own bed
don't wanna know you, don't wanna be your lucky bet
i'm gonna see you, as a shadow in the past
oh i'll see you and come right back to
got me too bad, you got me, you got me too bad
oh i'll see you and come right back to
got me too bad, you got me, you got me too bad
 sax 
oh i'll see you and come right back to
got me too bad, you got me, you got me too bad
oh i'll see you and come right back to
got me too bad, you got me, you got me too bad
x3


i see it now
see your state form a sun in your eyes
see it in the light
a thousand nights
chased away by the bright
by the brightest eye
how i've been waiting for it

i'm in the mood
never felt this good
when i'm with you
moving like i should

my friends were right
i've been trying to say it out loud
now the secret's out
and i will never shut my mouth about it

i'm in the mood
never felt this good
when i'm with you
moving like i should

all my friends were right, i just needed time
never thought i could ever feel this good

emotions, i'm drowning in the rain
big oceans
easily, we're swept away
i'm in the mood
i've never felt this good
when i'm with you
moving like i should

all my friends were right, i just needed time
never thought i could ever feel this good

all my friends were right, i just needed time
when i'm with you
moving like i should


are we really this far gone?
we yell upstream to watch it fall
have we still the faintest clue?
the past repeats to nothing new

every day is a shot in the dark and we're tested
afraid of the mark where we're more or we're less than
it's nothing new, oh oh oh, oh


i know my ties but i'm cutting them loose
'cuz i'm not gonna waste my time
when i'm locked in a noose
but if i can't help myself, i'm giving in, in
like all of the times i've held you up to let you win

but it's hard, and it hurts, and i'm tired
'cuz i run when you chase me
alone, i'm losing strength

are we really this far gone?
we yell upstream to watch it fall
have we still the faintest clue?
the past repeats to nothing new


rule number one
is that you gotta have fun
but, baby, when you're done
you gotta be the first to run
rule number two
just don't get attached to
somebody you could lose
so le let me tell you

this is how to be a heartbreaker
boys they like a little danger
we'll get him falling for a stranger, a player
singin' i lo lo lo love you
how to be a heartbreaker
boys they like the look of danger
we'll get him falling for a stranger, a player
singing i lo lo lo love you
at least i think i do
cause i lo lo lo love you

rule number three
wear your heart on your cheek
but never on your sleeve
unless you want to taste defeat
rule number four
gotta be looking pure
kiss him goodbye at the door
and leave him wanting more, more

this is how to be a heartbreaker
boys they like a little danger
we'll get him falling for a stranger, a player
singin' i lo lo lo love you
how to be a heartbreaker
boys they like the look of danger
we'll get him falling for a stranger, a player
singing i lo lo lo love you
at least i think i do
cause i lo lo lo love you

girls, we do, whatever it will take
cause girls don't want
we don't want our hearts to break, in two
so it's better to be fake
can't risk losing in love again, babe

this is how to be a heartbreaker
boys they like a little danger
we'll get him falling for a stranger, a player
singin' i lo lo lo love you
how to be a heartbreaker
boys they like the look of danger
we'll get him falling for a stranger, a player
singing i lo lo lo love you
at least i think i do
cause i lo lo lo love you
at least i think i do


i keep on searching for some way around
all that i've been given
and all that i have found
coming down from the ceiling
scratching wall just like dreaming
my impulse, my reflection
eyes are wide and stinging
when i look up to you
i know that i'm not alone
when i look up to you
i know we can go higher
i know we can go higher

inherit
whatever you want
inherit
it's all in the way that you feel it
all that you are
inherit, yeah, yeah
inherit

i know that we can go
i know that we can go
i know that we can go higher
i get so lifted
gnawing on a dream
started from i can't remember
now the riot time is on

inherit
whatever you want
inherit
it's all in the way that you feel it
all that you are
inherit, yeah, yeah
inherit

kiss me, do it
be my wife, speed of life
kiss me, do it
be my wife, speed of life
kiss me, do it
be my wife, speed of life

inherit
whatever you want
inherit
it's all in the way that you feel it
all that you are
inherit, yeah, yeah
inherit
whatever you want
inherit
it's all in the way that you feel it
all that you are
inherit, yeah, yeah


movin' miles apart
breathin' the same old air
watch another wheel turn
turn 'til it goes nowhere
rainin' down from above
finding the same old god
everything is undone
nobody said it's fair
these ways don't open any doors

you're breakin' me in two
livin' like i'm cast away
i'm falling back into
what feels like another day
sitting through a quiet storm
waiting for an empty nest
you're breakin' me in two
livin' like i'm cast away

drownin' under my breath
stare from across the street
just a second too late
waitin' all of these years
i stand alone in the hall
make a women outta me
try remember your face
it's always incomplete

you're breakin' me in two
livin' like i'm cast away
i'm falling back into
what feels like another day
sitting through a quiet storm
waiting for an empty nest
you're breakin' me in two
livin' like i'm cast away

swimmin' all alone in the chaos
watchin' all the planes as they take off
tell me, is it now or forever? ever, ever, ever

you're breakin' me in two
livin' like i'm cast away
i'm falling back into
what feels like another day
sitting through a quiet storm
waiting for an empty nest
you're breakin' me in two
livin' like i'm cast away


so i've lost my way
looking for a sign
watch it slip away
the mystery of time
but now the quiet hours, stay a littler a longer
til the darker days come and go again when they say

i ll be fine again
please, just

tell me it's only temporary
when i'm here feeling ordinary, no
don t try and hold me, if you're gonna hold me back
just tell me it's only temporary

so i've changed my mind
see it differently
on the other side
you're not listening to me
'cause when the ropes all break
nothing's gonna catch
with my hands untied
is anything the same? just

tell me it's only temporary
when i m here feeling ordinary, no
don t try and hold me, if you're gonna hold me back
just tell me it s only temporary

all the water is running
all the water is running
all the water is running out
do you see that it's coming?
do you see that it's coming?
do you see that it's coming now?
just

tell me it s only temporary
when i'm here feeling ordinary, no
don't try and hold me, if you're gonna hold me back
just tell me it's only temporary


rode my bike down the boulevard
hope you'd see me when i passed your yard
it was love from the very start
scrapped my knees when i fell too hard
too hard
too hard
too hard
too hard

waking up with you when we were together
i lost my temper, you left at midnight
we saw the tears fall like rain on the headlights

it was always you and me
how could we be nothing, nothing?
i know that we don't speak
but if i could ask you one thing, one thing

why can't we fucking get along?

'cause you've been the one
you know this will never change

wake up and i'm feeling fly
this morning feels like summertime
naked in my living room
and just like that, i'm over you

prayed for a guiding light, wished on a star  wished on a star 
i guess you're not alright until you are
i went to bed last night with a broken heart
now something's different

i'm feeling like the old me
no, you cannot control me
i learned these lessons wholly, rain on me
they got me singing, la la la la

sometimes i wonder what you'd say
if you could see my smiling face
here i am, i made it through  through 
this is me forgetting you

prayed for a guiding light, wished on a star  wished on a star 
i guess you're not alright until you are
i went to bed last night with a broken heart
now something's different, hey

i'm feeling like the old me
no, you cannot control me  no, you cannot, no, you cannot 
i learned these lessons wholly, rain on me
they got me singing, la la la la  oh 
i'm feeling like the old me  old me, yeah 
she's drunk at karaoke  ladies, dance with me, ladies, sing it with me 
goddamn, you should've told me
the old me, she got me singing, la la la la
 ah ah ah, ha ah, ah ah ah 


i gave up on time
just like you said you would
there are tiny cracks of light underneath me
and you say i got it wrong
but i tried hard to uncover them

i have somehow got
away with everything
anything you ever did was strictly by design
but you got it wrong
and i'll go anywhere but there

and you had best believe
that you cannot build what i don't need
and i know i need to feel relief
and you know you'll never fold
but i believe nothing that i'm told
and i know i need to feel relief

i know i need to feel released
take care to tell it just as it was
take care to tell on me for the cause
i know i need to feel released
take care to bury all that you can
take care to leave a trace of a man

i will show restraint
just like we said we should
you think i'll apologize for things i left behind
but you got it wrong
and i'm as sane as i ever was

you talk far too much
for someone so unkind
i will wipe the salt off of my skin
and i'll admit that i got it wrong
and there is grey between the lines

and you had best believe
that you cannot build what i don't need
and i know i need to feel relief
and i know you'll never fold
but i believe nothing that i'm told
and i know i need to feel relief

i know i need to feel released
take care to tell it just as it was
take care to tell on me for the cause
i know i need to feel released
take care to bury all that you can
take care to leave a trace of a man

i know, i know, i know, i know, oh oh
i know, i know, i know, i know, oh oh

i know i need to feel released
take care to tell it just as it was
take care to tell on me for the cause
i know i need to feel released
take care to bury all that you can
take care to leave a trace of a man

i know, i know, i know, i know, oh oh
i know i need...


you always find a way to make it 'bout you
it's not about you

we could have something real nice
but you're lost in your own vibe, yeah
never far away from your phone
calling back ain't that hard you know?
oh, you're making me think twice
everyone's got their own vice, yeah

a second from the past
stars are dancing in the universe
ねぇ are you having fun？
いつも通り going
たまにガス抜きも need
壊れないように
また記憶のピース
かき集めて
let's get the party started

笑われたフレーズでも we do
今日は with you　後は自由

you always make my wish come true
好みの happiness を scoop　全部 for you
i know you more than everyone else
you know me more than anybody
邪魔するものは何もない
to my love you are so hot
失った word
なら今日はもう

in this room of darkness i ain't undercover
that won't stop my prowess rubbing off on to another
elevating higher as my body's moving lower
now i've reached my element you better move over oh
but he doesn't, he blocks my way
i try to push past, but he wants to play
so i sip his drink as i hold his gaze
ooh

when we erupt in to the room
and hear the sub go boom
a feeling easy to resume
this right here i swear will end too soon
so i sink in to the tune
as i inhale the fume
a feeling easy to resume
this right here i swear will end too soon
 this right here i swear will end too soon 

my limbs seem to move what the beat dictates to me
i push in to the middle the sound becomes a part of me
taking me back to that sweet familiarity
making my adrenaline rise, i feel the eyes on me
sip the bottle now, don't be slow
keep up with me as we lose control
keep up with me as we lose control


when we erupt in to the room
and hear the sub go boom
a feeling easy to resume
this right here i swear will end too soon

 instrumental 


i get high all the time
i get drunk on my mind and call you at five in the mornin'
 five in the mornin' 
and i say what i like
and i don't like playin' nice
i might pick a fight without warnin', when it gets borin'

i try to keep it cool
and turn it down for you
but, i'm never gonna change

i said there's something 'bout the bad boys
that makes the good girls fall in love
i said there's something 'bout the bad boys

clear as a crystal or sharp as a knife
words will be words 'til you bring them to life

tell them girls to go find their own

i said there's something 'bout the bad boys

so far


well, you almost had me fooled
told me that i was nothing without you
oh, but after everything you've done
i can thank you for how strong i have become

 cause you brought the flames and you put me through hell
i had to learn how to fight for myself
and we both know all the truth i could tell
i'll just say this is i wish you farewell

i hope you're somewhere prayin , prayin'
i hope your soul is changin', changin'
i hope you find your peace
falling on your knees, prayin'

i'm proud of who i am
no more monsters, i can breathe again
and you said that i was done
well, you were wrong and now the best is yet to come
'cause i can make it on my own, oh
and i don't need you, i found a strength i ve never known
i ll bring thunder, i'll bring rain, oh oh
when i m finished, they won't even know your name

you brought the flames and you put me through hell
i had to learn how to fight for myself
and we both know all the truth i could tell
i'll just say this is i wish you farewell

i hope you're somewhere prayin , prayin'
i hope your soul is changin', changin'
i hope you find your peace
falling on your knees, prayin'

oh, sometimes i pray for you at night
someday, maybe you'll see the light
oh, some say, in life, you're gonna get what you give
but some things only god can forgive

i hope you're somewhere prayin', prayin'
i hope your soul is changin', changin'
i hope you find your peace
falling on your knees, prayin'

i'm in shambles since i blew my 16th candle
it's the little things that i can't handle
and we're still in july
call me or reach me 'cause i need samples
a newspapes with no more scandals
some loose change with no more vandals
can i get up out my mind?

and yeah, i know my world's burning down
where to run? who to call?
even though my world's burning down
i know i can get through the fall

'cause life must go on  go, go on 
one blink, then it's all gone
i said life must go on  go, go on 
even when you know it's all wrong
whether you're high, whether you're low
gotta keep on, be a part of the show
i said life must go on  go, go on 
go on, and you know i got you

in my mind, in the chemistry that i combine sits
a melody that's singing, "you're not fine"
but they can't hear me out
so i'm in a rapid conversation
to know if this is any normal sensation
the internet's saying i'm temptatious
and they can't hear me shout

and yeah, i know my world's burning down
where to run? who to call?
even though my world's burning down
i know i can get through the fall

'cause life must go on  go, go on 
one blink, then it's all gone
i said life must go on  go, go on 
even when you know it's all wrong
whether you're high, whether you're low
gotta keep on, be a part of the show
i said life must go on  go, go on 
go on, and you know i got you

everything keeps on changing and i'm caught in the middle
i just keep getting anxious, yeah, i'm caught in the middle
trouble turning these pages, yeah, i'm caught in the middle

'cause life must go on
one blink, then it's all gone
i said life must go on
even when you know it's all wrong
whether you're high, whether you're low
gotta keep on, be a part of the show
i said life must go on  yeah 
go on, and you know i got you
life must go on  life goes on 
one blink, then it's all gone  all gone 
i said life must go on  go on 
even when you know it's all wrong
so whether you're high, whether you're low
gotta keep on, be a part of the show
i said life must go on  life goes on 
go on, and you know i got you

whether you're high, whether you're low
gotta keep on, be a part of the show
i said life must go on
go on, and you know i got you


i know you're out in cabo
hanging with your brother
wishin' that i was your bottle
so i could be close to your lips again
i know you didn't call your parents and tell 'em that we ended
'cause you know that they'd be offended
did you not want to tell 'em it's the end?

and i know we're not supposed to talk
but i'm getting ahead of myself
i get scared when we're not
'cause i'm scared you're with somebody else
so, i guess that it's gone
and i just keep lying to myself
oh, i can't believe it, i 

i miss you, yeah, i miss you
i miss you, yeah, i miss you, oh, i do
i miss you, yeah, i miss you
though i m tryin  not to right now

you weren't a fan of pictures
so i hardly ever took 'em
got them saved in my mind from the bedroom
so that way i can't forget your skin
so i saved all the texts
all of the best over the years
just to remind myself of how good it is, or was

and i know we're not supposed to talk
but i'm getting ahead of myself
i get scared when we're not
'cause i'm scared you're with somebody else
so, i guess that it's gone
and i just keep lying to myself
oh, i can't believe it, i 

i miss you, yeah, i miss you
i miss you, yeah, i miss you, oh, i do
i miss you, yeah, i miss you
though i m tryin  not to right now

so i saved all the texts
all of the best over the years
just to remind myself of how good it is
yeah, i saved all the texts off of my ex
minus the tears
just to remind myself of how good it is, or was
'cause i 

i miss you, yeah, i miss you
i miss you, yeah, i miss you, oh, i do
i miss you, yeah, i miss you
though i m tryin  not to right now
i can't help it, i just
though i m tryin  not to right now
i can't help it, i just

mind it wanders far away
feeling in love but i just can't stay
searching magic every day
cross the ocean through the haze
take me back ocean blue bring me home
memories and mysteries point to you
take me back ocean blue bring me home
memories and mysteries point to you
pull my body to the shore
but i donl live here anymore
see you turn and speak to me
but i just hear whispers of the sea
take me back ocean blue bring me home
memories and mysteries point to you
take me back ocean blue bring me home
memories and mysteries point to you
dreaming i am going home
deadlights, sweet surprise
see the mourning in her eyes
don't look back, just cut me loose
keep on searching, find the truth
take my hand tonight and see the passage shining bright
eclipsing everything we know


murder lives forever and so does war
it s survival of the fittest, rich against the poor
at the end of the day, it s a human trait
hidden deep down inside of our dna

one man can build a bomb, another, run a race
to save somebody s life and have it blow up in his face
i m not the only one who finds it hard to understand
i m not afraid of god, i am afraid of man

is it running in our blood, is it running in our veins?
is it running in our genes, is it in our dna?
humans aren t gonna behave as we think we always should
yeah, we can be bad as we can be good

underneath it all, we re just savages
hidden behind shirts, ties, and marriages
how could we expect anything at all?
we re just animals still learning how to crawl

we live, we die, we steal, we kill, we lie
just like animals, but with far less grace
we laugh, we cry, like babies in the night
forever running wild in the human race

another day, another tale of rape
another ticking bomb to bury deep and detonate
i m not the only one who finds it hard to understand
i m not afraid of god, i am afraid of man

you can see it on the news
you can watch it on tv
you can read it on your phone
you can say it s troubling
humans aren t gonna behave as we think we always should
yeah, we can be bad as we can be good

underneath it all, we re just savages
hidden behind shirts, ties, and marriages
how could we expect anything at all?
we re just animals still learning how to crawl
underneath it all, we re just savages
hidden behind shirts, ties, and marriages
truth is in us all, cradle to the grave
we re just animals still learning to behave

all the hate coming out from a generation
who got everything and nothing, guided by temptation
were we born to abuse, shoot a gun and run
or has something deep inside of us come undone?
is it a human trait or is it learned behaviour?
are you killing for yourself or killing for your saviour?

underneath it all, we re just savages
hidden behind shirts, ties, and marriages
how could we expect anything at all?
we re just animals still learning how to crawl
underneath it all, we re just savages
hidden behind shirts, ties, and marriages
truth is in us all, cradle to the grave
we re just animals still learning to behave

ah, ah, ah ah ah
ah, ah, ah ah ah
ah, ah, ah ah ah
ah ah, ah ah ah ah
ah, ah, ah ah ah
ah, ah, ah ah ah
ah, ah, ah ah ah
ah ah, ah ah ah ah

and stay with me tonight


i'm alone but i'm not lonely
comfortably indulging
and trying to get to know me
i'm just an outline of what i used to be
constantly evolving
steadily revolving

i am confidently lost
i don't need you to find me
you don't define me
i am confidently lost
i don't need you to find me
'cause i'm not hiding
anything
anything

made up of hope and meditation
love, imagination
water my creations
baby it's amazing
all the days i'm facing
nothing seems to phase me
cause i

i am confidently lost
i don't need you to find me
'cause i'm not hiding
anything
anything
anything
anything

thinking about where i've gone
where i'm going
and i wouldn't change it for the world
thinking about where i'm from
if i belong there
but i wouldn't change it for anything
 i wouldn't change it for anything 
anything
anything
anything


i knew
when you told me you don't wanna go home tonight
and you tried to just shrug it off when i asked you why
somebody hurt you
somebody hurt you
but you're here by my side
and i knew
'cause i can recall when i was the one in your seat
i still got the scars and they occasionally bleed
cause somebody hurt me
somebody hurt me
but i'm staying alive

and i can tell
when you get nervous
you think being yourself
means being unworthy
and it's hard to love
with a heart that's hurting
but if you want to go out dancing

i know a place  ooh 
i know a place we can go  yeah 
where everyone gonna lay down their weapon
lay down their weapon
just give me trust and watch what'll happen
'cause i know  ooh 
i know a place we can run  yeah 
where everyone gonna lay down their weapon
lay down their weapon
don't you be afraid of love and affection
just lay down your weapon

right now
it's like you're carrying all the weight of your past
i see all your bruises, yellow, dark blue, and black
but baby a bruise is, only your body
tryna keep you intact
so right now
i think we should go get drunk on cheap wine
i think we should hop on the purple line
'cause maybe our purpose
is to never give up when we're on the right track

and i can tell
when you get nervous
you think being yourself
means being unworthy
and it's hard to love
with a heart that's hurting
but if you want to go out dancing

i know a place  ooh 
i know a place we can go  yeah 
where everyone gonna lay down their weapon
lay down their weapon
just give me trust and watch what'll happen
'cause i know  ooh 
i know a place we can run  yeah 
where everyone gonna lay down their weapon
lay down their weapon
don't you be afraid of love and affection
just lay down your weapon

they will try to make you unhappy
don't let them
they will try to tell you you're not free
don't listen
i, i know a place where you don't need protection
even if it's only in my imagination
even if our skin or our gods look different
i believe all human life is significant
i throw my arms open wide in resistance
he's not my leader even if he's my president

no  ooh 
let's build a place we can go  yeah 
where everyone gonna lay down their weapon
lay down their weapon
just give me trust and watch what'll happen
'cause i know  ooh 
i know a place we can run  yeah 
where everyone gonna lay down their weapon
lay down their weapon
don't you be afraid of love and affection
just lay down your weapon


oh, this is just the final day
the fight you gave, the fight i gave up
you burnt your lips 'cause you're unafraid
the light you gave, the light i gave up
well i set it out in the fire blue
your heart was in the valley too
in the desert i will carry you
i'll carry you and i'll carry you
and if this is the price to pay
you'll never look the other way
you'll never look the other way, oh

catch me
oh, my heart is steady
oh, my light is growing
we're standing in oceans
catch me
oh, my heart is steady
oh, my light is growing
we're standing in oceans

oh, this is just the final game
the fight you gave, the fight i gave up
dismiss the words your eyes betray
the light you gave, the light i gave up

if it's all i do
my heart beats true, and
with all i forgave
if this was ours again
i'd set it aflame

so catch me
oh, my heart is steady
oh, my light is growing
we're standing in oceans
catch me
oh, my heart is steady
oh, my light is growing
we're standing in oceans

catch me
oh, my heart is steady
oh, my light is growing
we're standing in oceans


shadows faded black
lovers losing track

youthful

but then you called me up the other day
i was shocked, but what could i say?
and your voice exactly the same
and it makes me feel, makes me feel

oh, just like we never said goodbye
when you spoke to me in that way
oh, just like we never said goodbye
and it makes me feel, makes me feel

we went out the very next day
you still remember my favorite place
and we laughed, just like we used to
and did everything we like to do
and now we re holding hands and running
and it makes me feel, makes me feel

oh, just like we never said goodbye
when you looked at me that way
oh, just like we never said goodbye
and it makes me feel, makes me feel
oh, just like we never said goodbye
when you held my hand that way
oh, just like we never said goodbye
and it makes me feel, makes me feel

we were young
we had everything we wanted
running wild through the night
we were young
we had everything we needed
and i see that now that you re here with me
i ve got everything that i could ever need
and it makes me feel, and it makes me feel
and it makes me feel, makes me feel

oh, just like we never said goodbye
when you held my hand in that way
oh, just like we never said goodbye
and it makes me feel, makes me feel

still got that glint in your eye
like you did the very first time
oh, it's like we never said goodbye
and it makes me feel, makes me feel, like everything that i could ever need
and it makes me feel, and it makes me feel, like i don't ever wanna say goodbye

i ve fallen on my own regret, building towers from my love. your claws around my throat again, all i am is not enough
tell me that there s something left, i m a coward and a cub. we try so hard but stay bereft, mm, i m broken up
i don t know where you go, but i know you so well, when i m alone with you, alone with you. i don t know who you are, when you re with your friends, i can only lose
it doesn t matter what we said, leave the flowers in the dust,  i can t remember what it meant, only that i wrote for both of us
won t you tell me that i m more than just my chemicals, i ve been thinking and it s more than just electrical


please go slowly
i wanna feel every move you make
all the nightmares
they will disappear
as you come near
let's dance all night

and you say it's gonna last forever
we have different heartbeats
but all the same heartbreak
and i can feel it in the way you hold me
the way you hold me
i know you're lonely too

so please go slowly
i can feel you move my way
all the darkness
it will fade away
until the light of day
you are my stars tonight

and you say it's gonna last forever
we have different heartbeats
but all the same heartbreak
and i can feel it in the way you hold me
the way you hold me
the way you hold me
the way you hold me
the way you hold me
i know you're lonely too, oohh

and i hope it's gonna last forever

but all the same heartbreak

in the way you hold me
 in your heartbeats

in the way you hold me
 in your heartbeats 
i know you're lonely
in the way you hold me
i know you're lonely
in the way you hold me
i know you're lonely
in the way you hold me
i know you're lonely
in the way you hold me


one, two, three, four

settle down with me
cover me up, cuddle me in
lie down with me
and hold me in your arms

and your heart's against my chest
your lips pressed to my neck
i'm falling for your eyes
but they don't know me yet
and with a feeling i'll forget, i'm in love now

kiss me like you wanna be loved
you wanna be loved
you wanna be loved
this feels like falling in love
we're falling in love
we're falling in love

but i'm cold as the wind blows
so hold me in your arms
oh no

my heart s against your chest
your lips pressed to my neck
i'm falling for your eyes
but they don't know me yet
and with a feeling i'll forget, i'm in love now

kiss me like you wanna be loved
you wanna be loved
you wanna be loved
this feels like falling in love
we're falling in love
we're falling in love


yeah, i've been feeling everything
from hate to love
from love to lust
from lust to truth
i guess that's how i know you
so i hold you close to help you give it up

so kiss me like you wanna be loved

you wanna be loved
this feels like falling in love
we're falling in love
falling in love


now tell me something
is there a point to this?
or are we living for the feeling
when we look back
on what we did and reminisce?

'cause i ve looked within and i've read
but instead i keep focusing
on just how thin i can get
now i'm looking for something else
i found myself: i m someone else

i keep looking for something
even though i know that it's not there
 maybe you're the reason 
every time i try to figure it out
you're the only thing i can think about
 maybe you're the reason 

and i think i'm dying
'cause this can't be living
should i be searching for
some kind of meaning?
apathy s a funny feeling

i turned my gaze to the ceiling
thanked a god i don t believe in
for the scene outside
i tried my best at sleeping but
my dreams were unappealing
so i searched for people in the landscape
passers by

i keep looking for something
even though i know that it's not there
 maybe you re the reason 
every time i try to figure it out
you're the only thing i can think about
 maybe you're the reason 


i keep looking for something
even though i know that it's not there
 maybe you re the reason 
every time i try to figure it out
you're the only thing i can think about
 maybe you're the reason 

i'm gonna fight 'em off
a seven nation army couldn't hold me back
they're gonna rip it off
taking their time right behind my back
and i'm talkin' to myself at night
because i can't forget
back and forth through my mind
behind a cigarette
and the message comin' from my eyes says leave it alone...
don't wanna hear about it
every single one's got a story to tell
everyone knows about it
from the queen of england to the hounds of hell
and if i catch it comin' back my way
i'm gonna serve it to you
and that ain't what you want to hear
but that's what i'll do
and the feeling coming from my bones says find a home...
i'm going to wichita
far from this opera forevermore
i'm gonna work the straw
make the sweat drip out of every pore
and i'm bleeding, and i'm bleeding, and i'm bleeding
right before the lord
all the words are gonna bleed from me
and i will think no more
and the stains comin' from my blood tell me "go back home"...

you say that you don't wanna talk about it
but you keep pulling out the words from my mouth
you hold my hand and face the wall in front of us
im ready to give it all up
oh, don't let this fear take control
let it wash over , the hearts we've broken
love, sometimes the best plans end up wrong
and those of us who find it first don't mean to hurt no one
let me talk about him one second, why didn't you wait
if you had let me tell you about him one second, i could've waited...
oh, don't let this fear take control
let it wash over, the hearts we've broken
love, sometimes the best plans end up wrong
cause all i need is you and i, and all i've got is misery without you...

everybody knows i got it
comfortable, in my silence
beautiful, vulgar, violent
not angry just disappointed
cause you never let me own it
did you?
do you think about me
when you re all alone
cause you know i do
i m dying to let you know the truth
cause you fucked me up
while i fucked with you, i m guilty too

shallow waters, not deep enough to drown
but just enough to get lost until i m found
shallow waters, not deep enough for danger
but just enough to want trouble with a stranger

you're selling me rich girl problems
with a poor man's life inside
so i work to the bone for nothing
but i see this from the outside
even though i look so perfect
i don't like these rules that apply
or these brand new chains ain't worth it
so i'm gonna break free from my life

shallow waters, not deep enough to drown
but just enough to get lost until i'm found
shallow waters, not deep enough for danger
but just enough to want trouble with a stranger
 woah  

not deep enough to drown
not deep enough for danger


spinning around, spinning around, spinning around

i'm spinning around, move out of my way
i know you're feeling me cause you like it like this
i'm breaking it down, i'm not the same
i know you're feeling me cause you like it like this

traded in my sorrow for some joy that i borrowed
from back in the day
threw away my old clothes, got myself a better wardrobe
i got something to say
i'm through with the past, ain't no point in looking back
the future will be
and did i forget to mention that i found a new direction
and it leads back to me?

i'm spinning around, move out of my way
i know you're feeling me cause you like it like this
i'm breaking it down, i'm not the same
i know you're feeling me cause you like it like this

the mistakes that i've made have given me the strength
to really believe
and no matter how i take it, there's no way i'm gonna fake it
'cause it's gotta be real
i've got nothing left to hide, no reason left to fight
'cause the truth's given me
a new freedom inside, getting rid of my desire
do you like what you see?

i'm spinning around, move out of my way
i know you're feeling me cause you like it like this
i'm breaking it down, i'm not the same
i know you're feeling me cause you like it like this

baby, baby, baby
you know you like it like this
baby, baby, baby
you know you like it like this
baby, baby, baby

i'm spinning around, move out of my way
i know you're feeling me cause you like it like this
i'm breaking it down, i'm not the same
i know you're feeling me cause you like it like this

i'm not the same

there's only one way up
we could be the most transcendent
go deep like dylan
there's only one way out

it's burning bright like a fire from a comet
if there's a bomb in your heart i'll disarm it
if you want it then i want it

i feel like elizabeth taylor at the after party
in a room full of strangers, just me and my bacardi
thinking of an old movie and the roles that we'd play
sometimes i look back and i wish that you stayed

but here i am, on my own

i've loved, i've lost, and loved again
but here i am, here i stand

another lesson learned, no one could tame me
another lesson learned, no one could tame me
another lesson learned, another lesson learned


signal
wave across the water for me
let me know
that you'll be waiting ever for me
oh, i've been travelling
waiting for a moment of peace
these stormy weathers
got me thinking of how i want it to be

 be, be, wanted to, wanted to be 
 be, wanted to be 

signal
light a thousand fires under me
give me no doubt
that i'm the one who never has to leave
oh, i've been divided
time and time again you keep the peace
give me shelter
let me be the man i wanted to be

 be, be, wanted to, wanted to be 
 be, wanted to be 
 be, be, wanted to, wanted to be 
 be, wanted to, wanted to be 
 be, wanted to, wanted to be 
 be, wanted to be

we've been patient,
out here waiting,
how long does it take to reach someone,
we've been saving,
our frustrations,
pennies on the dollar we've given,
but we can't wait any longer
so we're banging the door,
and we're pleading for more,
cause we hope,
everything'll change,
everything'll change,
no we don't have a key,
but we're not gonna leave,
cause we hope,
everything'll change,
everything'll change,
someday soon
hands are shaking,
legs are failing,
will this building ever feel like home,
cause time is faded,
and seconds wasted,
trying to squeeze the water from a stone,
but we can't wait any longer
so we're banging the door,
and we're pleading for more,
cause we hope,
everything'll change,
everything'll change,
no we don't have a key,
but we're not gonna leave,
cause we hope,
everything'll change,
everything'll change,
someday soon

for fear of living in regret
i've changed since from when we first met

now oh so easily you're over me
gone is love
it's me that ought to be moving on
you're not adorable
i want something un ignorable

i ain't freakin', i ain't fakin' this

well, she walked up to me and she asked me if i wanted to dance
she looked kinda nice and so i said that i might take a chance
and when she danced she held me tight
when she walked me home that night
all the stars were shining bright
and then she kissed me
each time i saw her i couldn't wait to see her again
i wanted to let her know that she was more than a friend
i didn't know just what to do
so i whispered i love you
she said that she loved me too
and then she kissed me
she kissed me in a way that i've never been kissed before
she kissed me in a way that i want to be kissed forever more
i knew that she was mine so i gave her all the love that i had
and one day she took me home to meet her mom and her dad
then she asked me to be her bride
and always be right by her side
i felt so happy i almost cried
and then she kissed me
and then she asked me to be her bride
and always be right by her side
i felt so happy i almost cried
and then she kissed me
and then she kissed me
and then she kissed me
and then she kissed me


i caught some feelings
now i sense a change
something beautiful has slipped away
i let you in and, then you disappear
like a dying of another day
i was never planning on
any of this chaos
i wasn't being difficult
but you still betrayed us

now i'm stuck in a rut, kicking stones
looking at my phone all night
maybe i've lost my mind
when i couldn't breathe
couldn't sleep
and you say it served me right
maybe i've lost my mind

you're on the ceiling
i'm down here on the floor
keeps me coming back
keeps me begging for more
i knew there'd be other girls
and i liked the danger
once or twice i've seen your soul
we weren't always strangers

stuck in a rut, kicking stones
looking at my phone all night
maybe i've lost my mind
when i couldn't breathe
couldn't sleep
and you say it served me right
maybe i've lost my mind

you wouldn't give me closure
let me get off the ride
and now i'm getting closer
to the other side

now i'm stuck in a rut, kicking stones
looking at my phone all night
maybe i've lost my mind
when i couldn't breathe
couldn't sleep
and you say it served me right
maybe i've lost my mind

stuck in a rut, kicking stones
looking at my phone all night
maybe i've lost my mind
stuck in a rut, kicking stones
looking at my phone all night
maybe i've lost my mind

you love me too much
don't let me do much
she love me too much, at least she use to
then i used her, i abused her
never thought i'd ever lose her
i confused her, but i refuse to
be so wicked, hallelujah

my one heart hurt another
so only one life can't be enough
can you give me just another
for that one who got away?

lonely i, i'm so alone now
there'll be no rest for the wicked
there's no song for the choir
there's no hope for the weary
you let them win without a fight

if one heart can mend another
only then can we begin
so won't you hold on a little longer?
don't let them get away

lonely i, i'm so alone now
there'll be no rest for the wicked
there's no song for the choir
there's no hope for the weary
you let them win without a fight

i let my good one down
i let my true love die
i had his heart but i broke it every time

pretty motherfucker from the north pole
jiggy motherfucker but my heart cold
and the rest washed up like bar soap
tell her read between the lines like a barcode
get it?
wicked, see my style, see my smile too wicked
oh wicked me, tell her wiki me
when she wiki me, she gotta lykke li
eazy e riding on the big spokes, on the 6 4
they say i switch hoes how i switch clothes
little nigga now doing big shows
but i'm heavy in the streets like i'm big pun
reckless, no resting, for the wicked, nigga i'm flexing
anti depressants, couldn't help you with the lesson
if you didn't get the message, only weight is digression
 i don't give a fuck little nigga 
no question, if love don't work it's just gone hurt
it all goes bad, it just gets worse
i can't describe with just 1 verse

lonely i, i'm so alone now
there'll be no rest for the wicked
there's no song for the choir
there's no home for the weary
if you let them win without a fight

i let my good one down
i let my true love die
i had his heart but i broke it every time

wicked, wicked, wicked, wicked, wicked  x2

seven children dream of sleep
losing count of hours to keep
singing songs from yesterday
it's got to feel so good to get away
lonely hearts club left behind
there's no shame in pain, there's only

time rider
he's just a whisper away from you
paris is turning
we drip like the rain tonight

broken watches keep the time
chasing heartbeats just like mine
every street light deep in glow
blinking blue, green and yellow
singing songs of yesterday
it's got to feel so good to get away
lonely hearts club left behind
there's no shame in pain, there's only

time rider
he's just a whisper away from you
paris is turning
we drip like the rain tonight
time rider
can i take your hand?
i want to ride with you
into the storm

broken engines burning gas
every moment from my past
making time for being late
buried neatly under gates
singing songs of things to come
it's got to feel so good to come undone
lonely hearts club left behind
there's no shame in pain, there's only

time rider
he's just a whisper away from you
paris is turning
we drip like the rain tonight
time rider
can i take your hand?
i want to ride with you
into the storm


i lie here restless like lines for a guest list
waiting for your message, i call out your name
but nobody answers, we spiral like dancers
i'll write you these last words to say

i'm begging, begging, begging you to please don't go
i don't wanna see you be with someone else
don't make me drive at night in hollywood as evenings go
i don't wanna put what we had on the shelf

i only want you and us
i only want you and us
i only want you to trust
i only want you and us, and us, and us

i'm waiting for something to make me feel something
but nothing fills nothing like we used to be
remember, remember when we said forever
we locked it and we lost the key

i'm begging, begging, begging you to please don't go
i don't wanna see you be with someone else
don't make me drive at night in hollywood as evenings go
i don't wanna put what we had on the shelf

i only want you and us
i only want you and us
i only want you to trust
i only want you and us, and us, and us

oh, i don't wanna be lonely
oh, i just want you to hold me down
oh, i don't wanna be lonely
oh, i just wanna be alone with you

i only want you and us
i only want you and us
i only want you to trust
i only want you and us, and us, and us


i can't be the only one who's lonely tonight
i can't be the only

one who's drinking by myself
wishing that i was somewhere else
talking to the voices in my head
because at least they're listening
right here's an easy place to hide
i stay in bed and shut the blinds
don't even know where i would go

but i know that there's gotta be somebody out there
there's gotta be somebody somewhere who needs company
and it's comforting to know

i can't be the only one who's lonely tonight
no, i can't be the only

one with nobody to call
this city makes me feel so small
a million people in this town
but i could scream without a sound
so i get high to pass the time
talk to someone i met online
to make myself feel less alone

'cause i know that there's gotta be somebody out there
there's gotta be somebody somewhere who needs company
and it's comforting to know

i can't be the only one who's lonely tonight
no, i can't be the only

no, i can't be the only one who's lonely tonight
no, i can't be the only one who's lonely
no, i can't be the only, the only


dancing with your silhouette in the places that we met
ooh, tryna find you in the moon
paris never feels the same, when the streets all call your name
ooh, so i hide in crowded rooms

and i'll follow right down the river
where the ocean meets the sky
to you, to you

once upon a time we had it all
somewhere down the line we went and lost it
one brick at a time we watched it fall
i m broken here tonight and darling, no one else can fix me
only you, only you
and no one else can fix me, only you
only you, only you
and no one else can fix me, only you, oh

only you

did i let go of your hand for a castle made of sand?
ooh, that fell into the blue
i went following the sun to be alone with everyone
ooh, looking 'round a crowded room

and i'll follow right down the river
where the ocean meets the sky
to you, to you

once upon a time we had it all  we had it all, mmm 
somewhere down the line we went and lost it  we went and lost it 
one brick at a time we watched it fall  fall 
i m broken here tonight and darling, no one else can fix me
only you, only you  yeah 
and no one else can fix me, only you  no one like you, yeah 
only you,  nobody else , only you  oh, oh 
and no one else can fix me, only you  oh 
only you
 falling, falling, falling, yeah 
 only you , only you,  only you , only you
 and no one else can fix me, only you   only you, oh 
 only you , only you,  only you , only you
 and no one else can fix me, only you 


slide into the cool mud
underneath the pines
somewhere to your right or left
is my body you can find

we are swimming with no clothes on
in a river in the dark
and i am holding on to you, boy
in the faint light of the stars

so you wade out across the marsh
water up to your waist
carry our stuff above your head
till the dune comes to a crest

we are swimming with no clothes on
in a river in the dark
and i am holding on to you, boy
in the faint light of the stars

but sometimes i feel it
in a dream i know i've been there
we were sleeping by the ocean
we were laughing on the warm sand
we stay up all night
and we wake up in the sunlight
we got dreams we keep together
we got time to spend, oh, hell yeah

we are swimming with no clothes on
in a river in the dark
and i am holding on to you, boy
in the faint light of the stars

we are lying
on the beach now
everything is warm
we are staying up
through a wild night
in the faint light
of the headlights
of passing cars

you drove me into the dark for a secret unveiling
you told me you saw the signs and went back to the start
too many times has the light drawn us home when we're failing
it wears us and tears us apart when we're walking too far
we give it a break, cause i've just myself to blame
and i think i'm all worn out from the nights i've spent alone
it's easy to say that i'm just a world away
and i think i'm all worn out from the time, the time, the time i had
in love
lost in the halls of my heart and my head i have found you
echoing through all the spaces i never could reach
you like to think that you keep me so honest and so true
i'm always going to pretend that i lie through my teeth
we give it a break, cause i've just myself to blame
and i think i'm all worn out from the nights i've spent alone
it's easy to say that i'm just a world away
and i think i'm all worn out from the time, the time, the time i had
in love

tell me where you've been to
nowhere that you shouldn't do
tell me what you're good for
i can tell you something too
where have you been staying?
tell me what you're playing
hope it's not my conscience
but it keeps complaining
didn't meet you in an alley
the cats they weren't complaining
i met you in the daylight
our visions misbehaving
i offer you my temper
with the hope that you would tame me
we built ourselves a shelter
you will always be my baby
feeling, keep on feeling, keep on feeling

i only wanna be your one life stand  keep on feeling 
tell me do you stand by your man?  keep on feeling 
i only wanna be your one life stand  keep on feeling 
tell me do you stand by your man?  keep on feeling 
wishes keep remaining
nothing worth containing
a balloon with air is escaping
is nothing but a plaything
moments keep us guessing
and lead us from temptation
but better to embrace them
and measure our relation

i only wanna be your one life stand  keep on feeling 
tell me do you stand by your man?  keep on feeling 
i only wanna be your one life stand  keep on feeling 
tell me do you stand by your man?  keep on feeling 

 could this be, could this be? 
i only wanna be your one life stand  keep on feeling 
 could this be, could this be? 
tell me do you stand by your man?  keep on feeling 
 could this be, could this be? 
i only wanna be your one life stand  keep on feeling 
 could this be, could this be? 
tell me do you stand by your man?  keep on feeling 


talk with friends 'round me, don't
talk with friends 'round me, don't

20 20 vision, got you with precision
it would take more than 1 or 2
to get me so into you  i'm not in your eyes 
i'm pretty jaded and i didn't even say that  i want you 
when you hit me up, there's no reply
once you're coming on, i go offline

you're the one that sent the message
i don't need you at my beck and call
what makes you so sure?  on and on 
when you're the one that instigated
i had not reciprocated, no
writing's on the wall

and you wonder why i didn't come back
don't wanna think twice on the contact
another wild ride, another nightcap
i gave you one try

and you wonder why i didn't come back
don't wanna think twice on the contact
another wild ride, another nightcap
i gave you one try till you're making me your alibi

no disrespect, i just wanna keep it candid
guessing we've got different standards, so low
i'm not feeling it, and thanks to my intuition
got me dodging a collision at last

you're the one that sent the message
i don't need you at my beck and call
what makes you so sure? one day
you're the one that sent the message
i reciprocated
no, ball's not in your court

and you wonder why i didn't come back
don't wanna think twice on the contact
another wild ride, another nightcap
i gave you one try

and you wonder why i didn't come back
don't wanna think twice on the contact

don't wanna think twice on the contact  wanna keep it candid 
another wild ride, another nightcap
i gave you one try till you're making me your alibi

one time, one time, one try till i am your alibi
one time, one time, one try till i am your alibi
one time, one time, one try till i am your alibi
one time, one time, one try

you wore me out to show your age
until we were just standing thin
dark light falling down within

things have moved enough for you to disagree
so sit aside and watch me try
to leave us all alone in time
when you're wrong then i can't hear
your feelings when you're least revered

the room's green
it's got writing on the wall
it's got one chair, it's kinda small
dirty shoes
running past the door
and then you go 'round, beat yourself up

ten minutes to go
and i wanna go home
ten minutes to go
yeah, i got to go home
ten minutes to go
and the air, it don't feel clear
everybody disappear
you're in it on your own

fourteen
intimidated, and she's just fourteen
she's getting pulled from the opposite side
until it breaks down
blame it on the wrong crowd
statement make up, hair dye

ten minutes to go
you know she should have gone home
ten minutes to go
yeah you should have gone home
ten minutes to go
and the air, it don't feel clear
everybody disappear
you're in it on your own

you can't sleep
you know it's over but you just can't sleep
you've gotta face it, gotta go outside
and do the day walk
living with the lights off
ain't nobody home

ten minutes to go
you know you wanna stay home
ten minutes to go
yeah you wanna stay home
ten minutes to go
and the air, it don't feel clear
everybody disappear
you're in it on your own

keep your head

and your keeping it heads up
keep it low, be right
push it kinda low
so, open your eyes



maybe it's bricks and mortar now
whether or not they run it down
i don't want anything to shake that shape away
no one told us which way to come
nobody mapped oblivion
so i go growing roses in the disarray

just like most, falling head in
till my ghost fills the bed in

so lift it up like a banner
hold it up over me
if this war is never ending
i'll take this love down with me
down with me

i don't need fate to give it time
it doesn't take pain to change your mind
no weapon can sever the soul from me

not the sorceress, not the money
all my cleverness, all my cunning

so lift it up like a banner
hold it up over me
if this war is never ending
i'll take this love down with me
down with me

it's around me in my surroundings
it counts me when it starts the counting
in the chaos, there is a standard
i'm carrying it

so lift it up like a banner
hold it up over me
if this war is never ending
i'll take this love down with me
hold it up over me
if this war is never ending
i'll take this love down with me

all of the sound working against you
your voice is too loud

four letter word just to get me along
it's a difficulty and i'm biting on my tongue
and i, i keep stalling, not keeping me together
people around got to find something to say now
holding back, every day the same
don't want to be a loner, listen to me, oh no
i never say anything at all
so with nothing to consider, they forget my name

they call me hell
they call me stacey
they call me her
they call me jane
that's not my name
that's not my name
that's not my name
that's not my name
they call me 'quiet' girl
but i'm a riot
mary jo lisa
always the same
that's not my name
that's not my name
that's not my name
that's not my name

i miss the catch if they throw me the ball
i'm the last drip standing up against the wall
keep up, falling, these heels they keep me boring
getting clamped up and sitting on the fence now
so alone all the time at night
lock myself away, listen to me, i'm not
though i'm dressed up out and all
with everything considered, they forget my name

they call me hell
they call me stacey
they call me her
they call me jane
that's not my name
that's not my name
that's not my name
that's not my name

that's not my name
that's not my name
that's not my name
that's not my name

this song was in my head
now it's in my mind
call it, reach it, get some words and get some timing
and though i realize
i cannot emphasize
i'll stick around but just don't promise, nothing binding
and baby, can't you see
that you're so desperately
a standing joker like a vocal one liner
instead of sing a long
this song is monotone
i've gotta get some soul, i gotta get some feeling
are you calling me darling?
are you calling me bird?
are you calling me darling?
are you calling me bird?

they call me hell
they call me stacey
they call me her

cupid don't love me like he used to do
'cause i'm broken hearted way too soon
i let my guard down
a devil's gone and left me a bruise, mmm
rocks at the bottom, will i try again?
romeo still lives in my head
thought i would settle down
when happy ever after'd been said, mmm

six, five, four, three
too many times i wish i'd never cared
been torn and twisted, oh i swear
too many nights crying that it's not fair
if i get hurt again
i'd need a lifetime to repair
i'd need a lifetime to repair
i'd need a lifetime to repair

they told me stories and they got me good
who's sayin' fairytales aren't true?
if he saves me from the dragon
well for that lovin', i'd be a fool, mmm
i'd overlook the stupid things he does
straight up forgive him when he's wrong
when he's fallen off the wagon
we'll still dance to our favourite slow song, mmm

six, five, four, three
too many times i wish i'd never cared
been torn and twisted, oh i swear
too many nights crying that it's not fair
if i get hurt again

take me back to when
i picked a fight with you
right out of the blue
i wish we made amends
i didn't mean to lose
all the good times that i had with you

i'm sorry, i'm sorry
if it doesn't mean too much right now
i know that you've probably forgotten
but these things still weigh me down
take me back to when
i picked a fight with you, ooh

i miss the way my mama knew what to do
she said to do right by your neighbour
and they'll do right by you
when we get older we can forget the truth
that if you do right by your neighbour
then they'll do right by you

we play this like a game
why do we pretend
that we were never friends?
when we both haven't changed
enough to just forget
the windows we broke with another
the secrets we spoke

i'm sorry, i'm sorry
if it doesn't mean too much right now
i know that you've probably forgotten
but these things still weigh me down

i miss the way my mama knew what to do
she said to do right by your neighbour
and they'll do right by you
when we get older we can forget the truth
that if you do right by your neighbour
then they'll do right by you

i'm sorry, i'm sorry
if it doesn't mean too much right now
i know that you've probably forgotten
but these things still weigh me down

i miss the way my mama knew what to do
she said to do right by your neighbour
and they'll do right by you
when we get older we can forget the truth
that if you do right by your neighbour
then they'll do right by you

you could turn this bar into a good time
feel like i'm not needing anything
when you hold my body like my blood does
after i've had a couple drinks
you could turn this dive into a five star
we can use your backseat as a bed
race around the city like a gangster
at least until we're breaking down again

you see the best in me, oh
and you're making me believe, oh

that i'm somebody special
that i'm somebody, ya i'm somebody
that i don't have to settle
not for nobody, not for nobody
i've been losing myself but lately
you got me thinking maybe i got potential
to be somebody, to be somebody
to be somebody special

i could just be dancing in the kitchen
wearing your t shirt like a dress
treasure me like i cost a million
as you whisper under your breath

you would do anything, oh
just to make me believe, me believe

that i'm somebody special
that i'm somebody, ya i'm somebody
that i don't have to settle
not for nobody, not for nobody
i've been losing myself but lately

to be somebody, to be somebody
to be somebody special

somebody, somebody
to be somebody special

i've been loving all the wrong kind
i've been falling in your arms
feeling like i'm good here for life
i've been lonely way too long
i've been loving all the wrong kind
i've been falling in your arms

i'm somebody special
that i don't have to settle
i've been losing myself but lately

to be somebody, to be somebody
to be somebody special

we received our bloody circles in the mail
only see what's really important when it's nailed
as a teen, my lord and savior was a male
tightened trucks and six steel strings that, keep me frail
it's the worst i've ever felt, when it hailed
broken teeth and bloody nose but least it snowed
instantly dry, oh, i cried and cut a line
in my eyebrow acted like the boys in town
then my teacher told me that this, made her sad
had to act just like the others to get around
friday nights alone in ilford with my board

like, growing up i have always heard or like, i was always hyperaware of
the things that the people around me who were charged with my care
or told me, like, be silent or be quiet
or be ashamed or hide
or perform a version of myself that wasn't really me
and so, i think that through my life i've always been hyperconscious and aware of not going into spaces and seeking too much attention
um, because part of survival is, like, being able to just fit in
to be seen as normal and to, like, quote unquote belong
but i think that so often in society in order to belong means that we have to, like, shrink parts of ourselves


so, like, my favorite images are the ones where
someone who isn't supposed to be there
who's like in a space, a space where
we were not ever welcomed in, where we were not invited
yet we walk in and we show all the way up
people try to put us down by saying
"she's doing the most," or "he's way too much."
but, like, why would we want to do the least?

cheap on your skin, smooth
jewels that ring
shine hit your eyes, black kiss the ring
ruby ebony sides, time
change my eyes for something, cool

a dream never leaving my sight
a sun never leaving my side
a feeling, a door starts to close
i'm feeling the burn in my eyes
the eyes of a heavy basset
suited to staying indoors like a good nigga
i treated the hope like my home
and destroyed it, go figure
still proud, best of my abilities
still i think about an exit
no one ever will appreciate
the way you bare your soul for them too
i'm through

jewels that ring
shine hit your eyes
black kiss the ring
ruby ebony sides

sometimes our bodies will hurt for some time
and the beauty in that can be hard to find
i want you to find it

i want you to see this
i want you to see this

so run, wake up and run, my little one

and rip out the cords and uncover your eyes
we'll make our escape in the dark of night
i need you to see this

oh, oh, oh
oh, oh, oh

and you'll come to learn
that falling in love is a strange work of art

and know that your scars are my favorite part

i don't see my friends no more, at all
ever since i let you go, you know

i'm drifting in the deep, tryna find a way home
driving through the streets, nowhere i wanna go
felt like all i need is how i had it before
thought that i'd feel free, but the freedom comes slow

lately, i've been leaning on myself  oh 
lately, i don't need nobody else
just trying not to feel the way i felt  oh 
lately, i've been leaning on myself
leaning on myself

lately i've been fine, i've been filling up my free time
wasting all my money, playing in the sunshine

i'm drifting in the deep, tryna find a way home
driving through the streets, nowhere i wanna go

i gotta bone to pick something i started noticing about you
i get suspicious
you switched up all your lipstick for something new
you claim you're innocent, you say i'm losing it and you're right
but i saw you getting out of a mazda miata last night...
that ain't your ride

i'll never get by on just enough
i'm still reaching out, he gets to touch
you got me on the side with half a love
but now can't see that it's...

you and me and somebody else
is it two or three, i never could tell
something's just not adding up between
you and me and somebody else
count me out, count me out
count me out, count me out
count me out, count me out
count me out

and in the bedroom you're trying all these new tricks i don't know
 where'd you get that from? 
phone blowing up, but none of your friends are 310

i'll never get by on just enough
i'm still reaching out, he gets to touch
you got me on the side with half a love
but now can't see that it's...

you and me and somebody else

something's just not adding up between
you and me and somebody else
count me out, count me out
count me out, count me out
count me out, count me out
count me out

give you one reason why i should stay, 'cause girl i feel played
i thought it was me and you, not the two of us and some dude
i know that you were free, but i never knew a couple was supposed to be three
what am i waiting for, another heartbreak i can't afford, no more

i'll never get by on just enough
i'm still reaching out, he gets to touch
you got me on the side with half a love

there's a few bad things i've done
that nobody made me do
most just to get myself off
and the rest to get over you
meant the things you said
turns out i had no idea
you'd ever tell me we were done
or what that would feel like to hear

and you think that i'm beautiful
but it's not enough
now i know i'm not so special

guess i'm gonna tell one more lie
i'm surprised you don't wanna stay by my side

i think about the time
when i went down on you in the gallery
and i was always out of line
but i thought you were right there with me

now i know i'm not so special
cause you're all dressed up
and i think you're so beautiful
but i'm not your love
now i know i'm not so special

hide from the sun; i won't be found
everywhere i go, it follows
i find my feet when i'm off the ground
and i keep running from my shadow
hide from the sun; i won't be found
and everywhere i go, it follows
i find my feet when i'm off the ground

they all shine soft and stand alone
like i picture you waiting at the end of a bridge
but it's hard for me to render up the things that we did

you playing doctor with the door unlocked
kissing on your cousin then you both got caught
and this is how the cleft was formed inside the silent ground
those words in your mouth

please leave us alone
when we're dancing
please leave us alone
when we're dancing

is your cheek still red from where you caught her hand
or are you just in love again
the search party's out yes they're hunting your name
but all your lovers, they look the same

you were driving with your eyes going seventy five
with your foot to the floor and your head to the sky
and this was how the cleft was born inside the silent ground
those words in your mouth

please leave us alone
when we're dancing
please leave us alone
when we're dancing
please leave us alone
when we're dancing
please leave us alone
when we're dancing

and full of life
and full of love

feels like i'm standing in a timeless dream
of light mist, of pale amber rose
feels like i'm lost in a deep cloud of heavenly scent
touching, discovering you

those days of warm rains come rushing back to me
miles of windless summer night air
secret moments shut in the heat of the afternoon
out of the stillness, soft spoken words

i love you always, forever
near and far, closer together
everywhere i will be with you
everything, i will do for you
i love you always, forever
near and far, closer together
everywhere i will be with you
everything, i will do for you

you've got the most unbelievable blue eyes i've ever seen
you've got me almost wilting away
as we lay there, under a blue sky with pure white stars
exotic sweetness, a magical time

i love you always, forever
near and far, closer together
everywhere i will be with you
everything, i will do for you
i love you always, forever

bienvenidos al futuro
que mandamos al infierno
la noche eterna envuelve la ciudad
contente, explota
¿ves las estrellas alrededor?
rojas, azules y blancas
otra esperanza ciega y fugaz
que se pierde
con la luz de cada amanecer
con la voz que gu a al mundo
hay un dolor animal
que no se puede ver ni tocar
y acercarse es peligroso
en una ciudad de cristal
que no se puede ver ni tocar
y so ar es peligroso
las ventanas nos vigilan
con ojos llenos de silencio
todo es libre excepto tú y yo
ahora que las calles son venas abiertas
pura sinergia sint tica
otra mentira quieta y letal
que te envuelve
con la luz de cada amanecer
con la voz que gu a al mundo
hay un dolor animal
que no se puede ver ni tocar
y acercarse es peligroso
en una ciudad de cristal
que no se puede ver ni tocar
y so ar es peligroso
en una ciudad, en una ciudad de cristal...


sad signs slip across my windowpane tonight
sad 'cause i don't have anyone to blame

listen to me,7 i'm calling your name
from the back of the class to the front of a finish line
seventh grade and you never really changed
all the battles you won
all these ladders and ropes that you fall from

i, i

sad signs, you did it to yourself this time
a cigarette that you tried to hide
you used to wear me like the jacket
uh, my human habit, babe

can you hear me? i'm calling your name
in the dead of the night like the life of the party
27 and everything's changing
all the holes that i dug are all covered up

except one
i, i
oh, i'm still waiting on your love
i, i
oh

the strangest sight
you came from above
asking if i'm alright
i said i don't get out much
and then you smiled
or did i make it all up?
oh, it's the saddest sight
now i'm still waiting on your love

i. i
waiting on your love
i  oh 
just waiting on your love
i...


i feel movements under my skin
when we collide
i feel it all when you let me in
caught in descent
with you i'm falling
a sweet decline
you'll hear me call
when the motion ends

steeper ground
shifting sound
falling, dissolving
 dissolving 
i'm in deeper now
we're drifting down
falling, dissolving with you
 dissolving with you 

passing figments
visualizing
read the sign
see it evolve
now you let me in
each signal sent
a deep heat rising
lift me off the ground
keep this distance
keep me closer now

steeper ground
shifting sound
falling, dissolving
i'm in deeper now
we're drifting down
falling, dissolving with you


i pushed all my problems to the back of my mind
then they surfaced in my dreams, they come alive
i sweep all my issues to somewhere i can't find
in hope that i ll forget but there s just so many times
why can t i be strong and just confront all my fears?
when my fear is hurting you by being sincere
but how many more days can i run? how many years?
emotions flooding and now it's all seeming so clear

crying for no reason, feel the tears roll down
i felt strong but am i breaking now?
crying for no reason  cause i buried it deep
i made promises i could not keep
 cause i never faced all the pain i caused
now the pain is hitting me full force

i pushed all my problems to the back of my brain
a darkness deep inside where i just can t find my way
how can i walk with a smile? get on with my day
when i deceived myself pretending it s all okay
i tried my best to hold it all together, i know
the strings have worn away and now i m all exposed
i try and hide it all away on top of the shelf
i can lie to everyone but not to myself

crying for no reason, feel the tears roll down
i felt strong but am i breaking now?
[crying for no reason  cause i buried it deep
i made promises i could not keep
 cause i never faced all the pain i caused
now the pain is hitting me full force

forgive me now  cause i said that i ll be there for you, care for you
i let you down, i walked away
 cause there were things i couldn t say to you, say to you
i m breaking now
i burned some bridges down
there must be some way out
the voices speak so loud
will you forgive me now?
i burned some bridges down
there must be some way out
the voices speak so loud
will you forgive me now?

crying for no reason, feel the tears roll down
i felt strong but am i breaking now?
[crying for no reason  cause i buried it deep
i made promises i could not keep
 cause i never faced all the pain i caused
now the pain is hitting me full force


hey, my love
buried you a month or two ago
i keep thinking that you're standing on my floor
that you're waiting there for me
hey, my love
you've walked out a hundred times, how was i
supposed to know this time that you wouldn't come
that you wouldn't come home

but four drinks i'm wasted
i can see you dancing, i can lay down next to you
at the foot of my bed
if i drink enough
i can taste your lipstick, i can lay down next to you
but it's all in my head
if i drink enough i swear that i will wake up next to you

when you left, you took my bestest friends away
and in this mess, i think i dug a thousand graves
talia, i hope you're happy anyway

but four drinks i'm wasted
i can see you dancing, i can lay down next to you
at the foot of my bed
if i drink enough
i can taste your lipstick, i can lay down next to you
but it's all in my head
if i drink enough i swear that i will wake up next to you

broke my heart now i'm wasting my time on you
broke my heart now i'm wasting my time
if i drink enough
i can see you dancing, i can lay down next to you
at the foot of my bed
if i drink enough
i can taste your lipstick, i can lay down next to you
but it's all in my head

but four drinks i'm wasted
i can see you dancing, i can lay down next to you
at the foot of my bed

been in and out of love since i was 19
opening my heart has left a bloodstain
and i don't know how to make a man stay
maybe i've been putting my heart out in the wrong way

and i'm bleeding
but i'm alright with it
darling, i'm alright with it
i'm bleeding out
but i'm alright with it
darling, i'm alright with it
it's just a bloodstain

thought i found the one when i was 23
and when it was done, it nearly killed me
i've got a little heart, not built for one night
i give it all away even when i know it isn't right

and i'm bleeding
but i'm alright with it
darling, i'm alright with it
i'm bleeding out
but i'm alright with it
darling, i'm alright with it

i'm gonna pull myself together
gonna wait till it's forever
gonna find someone who'll stay
who's not afraid of what i'm asking for
i know love is never easy
with the scars it's gonna leave me
i would rather love and bleed than never feel love at all

and i'm bleeding
but i'm alright with it
darling, i'm alright with it
and i'm bleeding out
but i'm alright with it
darling, i'm alright with it
it's just a bloodstain

 la petite mort  
 



she told me that she loved me by the water fountain
she told me that she loved me and she didn't love him
and that was really lovely 'cause it was innocent
but now she's got a cup with something else in it
it's getting kind of blurry at a quarter past ten
and he was in a hurry to be touching her skin
she's feeling kind of dirty when she's dancing with him
forgetting what she told me by the water fountain

now he's grabbing her hips, and pulling her in
kissing her lips, and whispering in her ear
and she knows that she shouldn't listen
and that she should be with me by the water fountain

she couldn't be at home in the night time because
it made her feel alone, but at that time she was too young
i was too young
i should've built a home with a fountain for us
the moment that she told me that she was in love
too young, i was too young
too young, too young, too young, young

and if she ever goes back to the water fountain
the handle will be broken and the rust set in
but my hand, it will be open and i'll try to fix it
my heart, it will be open and i'll try to give it

now i'm grabbing her hips, and pulling her in
kissing her lips, and whispering in her ear
and i know that it's only a wish
and that we're not standing by the water fountain
too young, too young, too young, young

she couldn't be at home in the night time
because it made her feel alone
but at that time she was too young
i was too young
i should've built a home with a fountain for us
the moment that she told me that she was in love
too young, i was too young
too young, too young, too young, young

 too young  i should've built a home with a fountain for us
 too young  the moment that she told me that she was in love
 too young  too young
 young  i was too young

easy to see it wasted
deep in the summer time
when the world's on fire
i feel and taste it
sticks to the roof of my mouth
lasts through the night

it s coming in a little bit hot, see
loving what i feel, but it gets to me
and i know it's all in my head
and it still makes the world feel a little like it ain't real

i swear you move slow motion
watching you looks like bending time
catch me in your illusion
helping me lose my mind

douse it in the water
cool when you feel it
hot, but it s turning down
it hurts to leave it
but it's much too much to handle now

it's coming in a little bit hot, see
loving what i feel, but it gets to me
and i know it's all in my head
and it still makes the world feel a little like it ain't real

i swear you move slow motion
watching you looks like bending time
catch me in your illusion
helping me lose my mind


i swear you move slow motion
watching you looks like bending time
catch me in your illusion
helping me lose my mind


lately, right now i feel like it's all over
'cause i've been trapped inside my head for so long
i'm sorry, i should've called when i was sober
but some days i get scared to be alone

i, i'm blacking out
and i can't help it
i, i scream and shout
and i can't help
sleeping with the light on every night
i can't stand my bedroom, i put blankets on the couch
it's killing me, i'm burning up inside
i'm a mess right now and i'm just freaking out
i'm seeing sounds, i'm freaking out

i'm freaking out
i'm freaking out

it's stupid
but i'm better off when i stay quiet
cause i push away all the ones that hold me close
i'm losing
my mind, on yeah, i just can't take it
i'm in the corner, yeah i'm bleeding on the ropes

i
i'm blacking out and i can't help it
i
i scream and shout
and i can't help it
sleeping with the light on every night
i can't stand my bedroom, i put blankets on the couch
it's killing me, i'm burning up inside
i'm a mess right now and i'm just freaking out
i'm seeing sounds, i'm freaking out

i'm freaking out
i'm freaking out

i'm freaking out


you're never gonna love me, so what's the use?
what's the point in playing a game you're gonna lose?
what's the point in saying you love me like a friend?
what's the point in saying it's never gonna end?

you're too proud to say that you made a mistake
you're a coward till the end
i don't wanna admit that we're not gonna fit
no, i'm not the type that you like
why don't we just pretend?

lies
don't wanna know, don't wanna know, oh
i can't let you go, can't let you go, oh
i just want it to be perfect
to believe it's all been worth the fight
lies
don't wanna know, don't wanna know, oh

you only ever touch me in the dark
only if we're drinking can you see my spark
and only in the evening could you give yourself to me
'cause the night is your woman, and she'll set you free

you're too proud to say that you made a mistake
you're a coward till the end
i don't wanna admit that we're not gonna fit
no, i'm not the type that you like
why don't we just pretend?

lies
don't wanna know, don't wanna know, oh
i can't let you go, can't let you go, oh
i just want it to be perfect
to believe it's all been worth the fight
lies
don't wanna know, don't wanna know, oh

 ooh

lies
don't wanna know, don t wanna know, oh
i can't let you go, can't let you go, oh
i just want it to be perfect
to believe it's all been worth the fight
lies
don't wanna know, don't wanna know, oh


not really sure what, i've gotten into
my hands are shaky, just looking at you
it's 3 am now, everyone's leaving
and i'm just frozen

i gotta catch you in the street while you're trying to leave, yeah
at the door of your car with my heart on my sleeve, yeah

listen, i don't always act this way
usually i would have more to say
i let the moment get the best of me
can you feel my nervous energy?
i don't always give myself away
if you had caught me on a different day
i let the moment get the best of me
can you feel my nervous energy? yeah

the moon is lighting up the windows
i kinda like you, but it's not that simple
'cause i don't know you, the way i want to
then i get inside my my head sometimes

parked in the street and your eyes are on me, yeah
got me feeling so good that it's harder to read, you

listen, i don't always act this way
usually i would have more to say
i let the moment get the best of me
can you feel my nervous energy?
i don't always give myself away
if you had caught me on a different day
i let the moment get the best of me  best of me 
can you feel my nervous energy?  yeah 
listen, i don't always act this way
usually i would have more to say
i let the moment get the best of me
can you feel my nervous energy?
i don't always give myself away  self away 
if you had caught me on a different day  different day 
i let the moment get the best of me  best of me 
can you feel my nervous energy? yeah


now tell me something
is there a point to this?
or are we living for the feeling
when we look back
on what we did and reminisce?

'cause i ve looked within and i've read
but instead i keep focusing
on just how thin i can get
now i'm looking for something else
i found myself: i m someone else

i keep looking for something
even though i know that it's not there
 maybe you're the reason 
every time i try to figure it out
you're the only thing i can think about
 maybe you're the reason 

and i think i'm dying
'cause this can't be living
should i be searching for
some kind of meaning?
apathy s a funny feeling

i turned my gaze to the ceiling
thanked a god i don t believe in
for the scene outside
i tried my best at sleeping but
my dreams were unappealing
so i searched for people in the landscape
passers by

i keep looking for something
even though i know that it's not there
 maybe you re the reason 
every time i try to figure it out
you're the only thing i can think about
 maybe you're the reason 


i keep looking for something
even though i know that it's not there
 maybe you re the reason 
every time i try to figure it out
you're the only thing i can think about
 maybe you're the reason 


drivin' through the night to see you
i don't care if you don't care
you go through me like i'm see through
and i see you everywhere  i see you everywhere 

i've been lyin' all alone in an empty bed

we were staying in paris
to get away from your parents
and i thought,  wow

i don't think that we could work this out 
out on the terrace
i don't know if it's fair but i thought  how
could i let you fall by yourself
while i'm wasted with someone else? 

if we go down then we go down together

we were staying in paris
to get away from your parents
you look so proud
standing there with a frown and a cigarette
posting pictures of yourself on the internet
out on the terrace
we breathe in the air of this small town
on our own, cuttin' class for the thrill of it
getting drunk on the past, we were livin' in

if we go down then we go down together
they'll say you could do anything
they'll say that i was clever

'member when you made me feel less?
i'd be feeling kind of anxious every time i'd undress, but i
i don't really worry 'bout it now
i don't really wanna have to worry about it now that i
feel you feeding me, keeping it right
now you love me better than ever
and i'm filling you with light, so i
i don't really worry 'bout it now
i don't really wanna have to worry about it now

ayy, ayy, ayy ayy
ayy ayy ayy ayy
ayy ayy ayy ayy
ayy, ayy, ayy ayy
ayy ayy ayy ayy
ayy ayy ayy ayy

i put myself right at the top of your plate
i knew i'd be something you'd wanna taste
don't need to indicate a play if i could feel it, like i feel it
my baby lately gave me real piece
put your love on me, i'll take you on my team
don't need to complicate it, say it how i mean it, how i mean it

i can't believe what you meant to me now
we've been feeling so connected, wanna say it out loud
and i wanna leave brown sugar in my mouth
do we really need to know what we're about?
yeah, we're running around on the sky side of the clouds
gotta chase me a little bit, baiting me, wanna fetch me down here
i'm so deep i'm swimming in your soul
flash back, year '03, if only i could see me now

ayy, ayy, ayy ayy
ayy ayy ayy ayy
ayy ayy ayy ayy
ayy, ayy, ayy ayy
ayy ayy ayy ayy
ayy ayy ayy ayy

hold me right up, watch me light up
love the sight of us when you and i laugh
sugar on my tongue, you put the air in my lungs
you make my blood sweet in the morning with my buttons undone
take me higher, love me wider
sweet saliva and i just wanna lie
i'm not shy, yeah, i don't need to try, yeah
in your fire and i think that i could die

ayy, ayy, ayy ayy
i think that i could die
ayy, ayy, ayy ayy
ayy ayy ayy ayy
yeah, i think that i could die
ayy, ayy, ayy ayy

ayy ayy ayy ayy
i'm not shy, i don't need to try, i'm
ayy ayy ayy ayy

if you need me closer, i'm still here
don't waste time, darling, hold me near
words might fail where judge makes clear
don't fear tomorrow, it's coming slow
just hold me, darling, and let me go

i don't wanna be afraid that when you ask me to stay
you feel i've pushed you aside
my love can cross the divide
wish you'd believe me, you can stand on your own
you need a moment to breathe
love grows in spaces between

let's just remember the point, my love
please just be here with me now

and if you need me closer, i'm still here
don't waste time, darling, hold me near
words might fail where judge makes clear
don't fear tomorrow, it's coming slow
just hold me, darling, and let me go

because
there's a thing that happens when two people decide
they don't need to reassure something so simple and pure
it seems to me we have this moment in time
why are we talking it through?
i wonder how much can the talking do
and i don't want to hear a sound

just remember the point, my love
let's just remember the point, my love
oh, let's just remember the point, my love
please just be here with me now oh

and if you need me closer, i'm still here  oh, i'm here 
don't waste time, darling, hold me near  hold me near 
words might fail where judge makes clear
don't fear tomorrow  don't fear tomorrow , it's coming slow
just hold me, darling, and let me go
just hold me, darling, and let me go

you could turn this bar into a good time
feel like i'm not needing anything
when you hold my body like my blood does
after i've had a couple drinks
you could turn this dive into a five star
we can use your backseat as a bed
race around the city like a gangster
at least until we're breaking down again

you see the best in me, oh
and you're making me believe, oh

that i'm somebody special
that i'm somebody, ya i'm somebody

not for nobody, not for nobody
i've been losing myself but lately
you got me thinking maybe i got potential
to be somebody, to be somebody
to be somebody special

i could just be dancing in the kitchen
wearing your t shirt like a dress
treasure me like i cost a million
as you whisper under your breath

you would do anything, oh
just to make me believe, me believe

that i'm somebody special

i've got a distant memory of previous lives
so don't say i'm not ready, back off with those knives

no new year's day to celebrate
no chocolate covered candy hearts to give away
no first of spring, no song to sing
in fact here's just another ordinary day

no april rain, no flowers bloom
no wedding saturday within the month of june
but what it is is something new
made up of these three words i say to you

i just called to say i love you
i just called to say how much i care
i just called to say i love you
and i mean it from the bottom of my heart

no summer's high
no warm july
no harvest moon to light one tender august night
no autumn breeze
no falling leaves
not even time for birds to fly to southern skies
no libra sun
no halloween
no giving thanks to all the christmas joy you bring
but what it is, though old so new
to fill your heart like no three words could ever do

i just called to say i love you
i just called to say how much i care
i just called to say i love you
and i mean it from the bottom of my heart

i just called to say i love you
i just called to say how much i care
i just called to say i love you
and i mean it from the bottom of my heart


wait up, don't wanna wait up for you baby
still i wait up, lonely in the canyon
no love, there's no love reflecting in the glow of
million dollar man

show me your cut, baby, come clean
come out of your smokescreen
if you really love me, open my eyes
babe, you burned me
your kiss is salty chlorine

swimming pool, swimming pool

who builds a world upon a man?
my ship has sailed, this ship has sailed
it was loaded with jewels and gems
wave my vices farewell for the best

 ah, ah ah
ah, ah ah 

the careless knot i knew wouldn't hold
pulled you out to open sea
silence drained us on all that was golden
you got the worst of me
shouting at the top of my lungs
as loud as the siren sings
now i watch it all slip away, slip away here
with my hands untied as the sky bleed red

 ooh ooh ooh
ooh ooh ooh ooh 

as empty as your open chest
i roam the hills deliriously
walk in the shatters at the bottom of our ocean
you're drifting off to leave me clean

the careless knot i knew wouldn't hold
pulled you out to open sea
silence drained us on all that was golden
you got the worst of me
shouting at the top of my lungs
as loud as the siren sings
spiralling out of control
i had to set you free
now i watch it all slip away, slip away here
with my hands untied as the sky bleed red

the careless knot i knew wouldn't hold
pulled you out to open sea
silence drained us on all that was golden
you got the worst of me
now i watch it all slip away, slip away here
with my hands untied as the sky bleed red


can't look at you the same way, anticipatin' heartbreak
and i know, and i know, and i know
i'm puttin' on a brave face to meet you in the same place
and i know, and i know, and i know
gotta let my mind find another space
cause i heard these scars never go away
and now i'm runnin' out of ways to numb the pain

so if you're gonna hurt me
why don't you hurt me a little bit more?
just dig a little deeper
push a little harder than before
and i'm counting down the seconds that we have
i can see the end in sight, at last
so if you're gonna hurt me
why don't you hurt me a little bit more?

like breathing underwater, what's the law and order?
i don't know, i don't know, i don't know
you're sitting in a corner, hiding 'til it's over
and it shows, and it shows, and it shows
buildin' up my walls just to tear them down
tell me that it's love, force me to drown
buildin' up my walls just to tear them down
tell me that it's love
 and i thought you said you still loved me 

so if you're gonna hurt me
why don't you hurt me a little bit more?
just dig a little deeper
push a little harder than before
and i'm counting down the seconds that we have
i can see the end in sight, at last
so if you're gonna hurt me
why don't you hurt me a little bit more?

never thought i would lose my grip
i always thought it was an adverse trip
never thought it would hurt so much
lost your way to another touch
and i thought you said you loved me

so if you're gonna hurt me
why don't you hurt me a little bit more?
just dig a little deeper
push a little harder than before
and i'm counting down the seconds that we have
i can see the end in sight, at last
so if you're gonna hurt me
why don't you hurt me a little bit more?


oh, ah ah

if you don't need me
just let me go

you hate, you bite, you lose
after all, i just don't like you
it's nice that you say you like me
but only conditionally
your voice, it had the perfect glow
it got lost when you gave it up though
cause you want money, you want fame

aye yeah, aye yeah
aye, i don't see the light i saw in you before
and no, i don't

i don't really like to run
but lately i have found it fun
to sprint around the lakes as if my life
depended on it, just so i could tell you about it
i get lost in conversations
trying to find the right occasion
to escape and check what you have sent
a video of fish making patterns on the

bottom of the blue ocean
would you do that for me?
only for a brief moment

suddenly i seem to have a lot to do around the streets
where you are coming frequently
why do i never bump into you coincidentally
am i making something up?
the nicest thing you said was
"you look ready to do business"
when i tried to impress you and dressed up in a suit
i'm over interpretating
when the waiter asks if we are dating
no, we're just a couple of friends
watching videos of fish making patterns on the

bottom of the blue ocean
would you do that for me?
only for a brief moment
and so we're lying in the dents
making ripples in the sand
like this would never end
and so we are all and everything
making ripples in the sand
like this would never end

patterns in the blue ocean
you made that for me
only for a brief moment
patterns in the blue ocean
you made that for me
only for a brief moment

and so we're all and everything
making ripples in the sand
like this would never end


you'll be given love
you'll be taken care of
you'll be given love
you have to trust it

maybe not from the sources
you have poured yours
maybe not from the directions
you are staring at

twist your head around
it's all around you
all is full of love
all around you

all is full of love
you just ain't receiving
all is full of love
your phone is off the hook
all is full of love
your doors are all shut
all is full of love

all is full of love, all is full of love
all is full of love, all is full of love
all is full of love
all is full of love, all is full of love
all is full of love

too many lights out, but nowhere near here
it was me on that road
still you couldn't see me
and the flashlights and explosions
road's end getting nearer
we cover distance but not together
i am the storm, and i am the wonder
and the flashlights, nightmares, sudden explosions
i don't know what more to ask for
i was given just one wish
it's about you and the sun
a morning run
the story of my maker
what i have and what i ache for
i've got a golden ear
i cut and i spear
and what else is there?
road's end getting nearer
we cover distance still not together
if i am the storm, if i am the wonder
will i have flashlights, nightmares, sudden explosions?
i don't know what more to ask for
i was giving just one wish
road's end getting nearer
we cover distance but not together
i am the storm and i am the wonder
and the flashlights, nightmares, sudden explosions
there is no room where i can go and
you've got secrets too
i don't know what more to ask for
i was given just one wish

reckless with your love
you. just. give it up
fearless with your life
but no one can you trust
reckless with your love
you. just. give it away
fearless with your life
living day to day
i'm talking to myself like i used to do
the touch of someone else
always gets to you
then something in you eyes

better know what to say
gotta know what to do
i can't feel a thing with you
baby i can't feel a thing

given a lie, never been true
but i get stronger everyday
while you're

gimme a call, tell me it's alright
and i won't feel a thing
promise i won't feel a thing

and i guess that i got rewired
'cause you're cold as ice but it feels like fire, fire, fire, fire
and the drugs don't work and i don't know why
but when you hurt me i go higher, higher, higher, higher

but when i'm crying on the bathroom floor
tearing off the dress i wore, i wonder
if i could ever ask for more
if i'm ever gonna ask for more from a lover
crying on the bathroom floor
tearing off the dress i wore, i wonder
if i could ever ask for more
if i'm ever gonna ask for more from a lover

gimme your disrespect
gimme your pain and loneliness
and i'll love you the best
promise i'll love you the best
gimme no peace of mind
gimme distrust, gimme all your lies
and i'll love you for life
promise i'll love you 'til i die

but when i'm crying on the bathroom floor
 give me some more 
tearing off the dress i wore, i wonder
if i could ever ask for more
 would you give me some more 
if i'm ever gonna ask for more from a lover
crying on the bathroom floor
 give me some more 
tearing off the dress i wore, i wonder
if i could ever ask for more
 would you give me some more 
if i'm ever gonna ask for more from a lover

cause i'm asking a lot of myself
i'm asking a lot of myself
it's taking a lot out of me loving you
it's taking a lot out of me loving you
i'm asking a lot of myself
asking a lot of myself
it's taking a lot out of me loving you
but there isn't a lot that i think i can do

crying on the bathroom floor
tearing off the dress i wore, i wonder
if i could ever ask for more
 would you give me some more 
if i'm ever gonna ask for more from a lover
crying on the bathroom floor
 give me some more 
tearing off the dress i wore, i wonder
if i could ever ask for more
 would you give me some more 
if i'm ever gonna ask for more from a lover

i'm in love with your brother
what's his name?
i thought i'd come by
to see him again
when you two danced
oh what a dance
when you two laughed
oh what a laugh
has he mentioned my age love?
or is he more into young girls with dyed black hair?
i'm in love with your brother
i thought i'd come by
i'm in love with your brother
yes i am
but maybe i shouldn't ask for his name
and you danced
oh what a dance
and you laughed
oh what a laugh
does he know what i do?
and you'll pass this on, won't you?
and if i ask him once what would he say?
is he willing?
can he play?
if i ask him once what would he say?

does he know what i do?
and you'll pass this on, won't you?
and if i ask him once what would he say?

can he play?
i wasn t really looking for much more than
some company on the dance floor and
does he know what i do? and
you ll pass this on, won t you?
i wasn t really looking for much more than
some company on the dance floor and
if i asked him once, what would he say?

i don't wanna see you smile
i want you in the morning
before you go performing
tell me something i don't know and lead me to the place where no one ever goes
let me go under your skin, and let me find the demons that drive those heavenly limbs
you know you're beautiful
but that ain't half the gold treasure in your soul
what you got cause i want it all
with your fingers in my mouth i fail to see your faults so please don't let me fall, please don't let me fall
i think we d survive in the wild
we would eat plants and roots and dream about electric fans
but baby could you kill a man, could you look in his eyes and feel the fire drain out of his hands
and baby do you think about the past, do you wonder if every stupid little thing has led us to this
you know you're beautiful
but that ain't half the gold treasure in your soul
what you got cause i want it all
with your fingers in my mouth i fail to see your faults so please don't let me fall, please don't let me fall


i can't undo, i can't unsee
i can't unchoose, i can't unchange
i can't unpack, i can't unlose
i can't unfake you've caused no pain
what are we going to do, me and you
i guess it's just different points of view
but i can't gain perspective
when you appear so unaffected

estranged feels strange, estranged feels strange
does estranged feel strange? estranged feels strange
when i never was a fighter and i don't want to blame
it's not the same as an argument
estranged feels strange, estranged feels strange

now i can't relate, i can't feel safe
i can't retain, i can't stay the same
i can't even say your name, i count the days
i cannot stand this bitter taste
so, what's the problem
between us two?
cause i can't find perspective
when i still feel so connected to you

estranged feels strange, estranged feels strange
estranged feels strange, estranged feels strange
i wish we had a fight, or reasons to hate
that always ends with an argument
estranged feels strange, estranged feels strange

i can't undo, i can't unsee
i can't unchoose, i can't unchange
i can't unpack, i can't unlose
i can't unfake you've caused no pain
what are we going to do, me and you
i guess it's just different points of view
but i can't gain perspective
when you appear so unaffected
 estranged feels strange, estranged feels strange 
estranged feels strange
 estranged feels strange, estranged feels strange

 estranged feels strange, estranged feels strange

i was gonna cancel
then i looked into the sky
and knew the bad news won't prevent the sun to shine
i was gonna cancel
then took a sec to realize
all the disappointment that would trail behind
i was gonna cancel
then you reminded me of who i am
everything is clearer than a mirror is to woman
just the same as a dog is to man

just hop out of the bed,  hey 
go ahead face the day
who cares what you know
don't let that in the way no way
shut out all the doubt,  hey 
just get up and go

you will never know unless you
go, go, go, go o o
go, go, go, go o o
go, go, go, go o o
go, go, go, go girl

i was gonna cancel
then i thought about the strength that
i got from all of the prayers and what it meant
i was gonna cancel
then i realized that time is just like money and love
watch how you spend
i was gonna cancel
until you reminded me of what i do
now i see it clearer
my best friend is the mirror look behind me
and i see all the things i've been through

just hop out of the bed,  hey 
go ahead face the day
who cares what you know

go, go, go, go o o
go, go, go, go o o
go, go, go, go girl

what's wrong with saying i love you?
it's nothing to kid about
some people going through a struggle
trying to scribble it out
they say attention is a shovel
it's time to dig 'em out
you can't just let them stay in a bubble
they'll pop to get it out
what's wrong with love, love?
what's wrong with love, love?

just hop out of the bed,  hey 
go ahead face the day
who cares what you know
don't let that in the way no way
shut out all the doubt,  hey 
just get up and go
what's on the other side?  yeah 
you will never know unless you
go, go, go, go o o
go, go, go, go o o
go, go, go, go o o
go, go, go, go girl

keepin' my mouth shut, 'cause i couldn't tell you
everything i saw when i was still a boy in school
i was still a boy in school
sometimes i feel like i've gone insane
'cause i can't change my mind, but i can't stay the same, except you
i still feel the same about you

i can't help but dream about your song
your voice in my head makes me feel numb
you said

"i'm at home, i'm waitin' on ya
drove all the way from california
i'm at home, i'm waitin' on ya
i knew i couldn't live without ya
i'm at home, i'm waitin' on ya
drove all the way from california
i'm at home, i'm waitin' on ya
i knew i couldn't live without ya"

similar people, won't make a sound
so many people lookin' for somethin' to do
we're all lookin' for somethin' to do
i feel annoying most of the time
but i keep on talkin' just to keep my mind off you
just to keep my mind off you

i can't help but dream about your song
your voice in my head makes me feel numb
you said

"i've been home, i'm waiting on ya
drove all the way from california
i've been home, i'm waiting on ya
i knew i couldn't live without ya
i've been home, i'm waiting on ya
drove all the way from california
i've been home, i'm waiting on ya
i knew i couldn't live without ya"


i'm at home, i'm waitin', i'm at home, i'm waitin' on ya
i'm at home, i'm waitin', i'm at home, i'm waitin' on ya
i'm at home, i'm waitin', i'm at home, i'm waitin' on ya
i'm at home, i'm waitin', i'm at home, i'm waitin' on ya
i'm at home, i'm waitin', i'm at home, i'm waitin' on ya

you and i, used to walk the streets at night
our parents didn't know, we kept the tv goin'
and left on all the bedroom lights
and no, i haven't seen you since we lost all our innocence
you left me in the dark while you drink in the park
i'll never be the same again

you and me were so, so close
and maybe that's what hurts the most
it's out of my hands, i've done what i can
so i just save my breath

deep in my heart, i know that it's over
deleted your number, so i can't call you
call you my brother, the way that we used to
when we were younger, younger

i saw you just the other night
i didn't even recognize you
find it kind of strange, i guess that people change
but i didn't expect you to

you and me were so, so close
and maybe that's what hurts the most
it's out my hands, i've done what i can
so i just save my breath

deep in my heart, i know that it's over
deleted your number, so i can't call you
call you my brother, the way that we used to
when we were younger, younger

tryna get in touch with you, i don't know where you've been
have a conversation but you'll never let me in
i've tried, i've tried
i've tried with you a thousand times
maybe i don't have to play the bad guy in the end
'cause i've been trying hard enough to be a better friend
i've tried, i've tried
but we're out of time

deep in my heart, i know that it's over
deleted your number so, i can't call you
my brother, the way that we used to
when we were younger, younger

and wrap it up in a sailor s knot
and hide it in your case

but it was oh so hard to tell
but you knew that we would meet again
if your memory serves you well

that called on me to call on them
to get you your favors done
and after every plan had failed
and there was nothing more to tell

'cause everyday is all there is
in my some kind of bliss
'cause everyday is all there is
in my some kind of bliss

slip into stillness and be above it all
good to be here, time to be alone
find a space where i belong
not succumb to fear

'cause everyday is all there is
in my some kind of bliss
'cause everyday is all there is
in my some kind of bliss


'cause everyday is all there is
in my some kind of bliss

since you took your time, you should know why i m quitting

the secrets i hide, i do nothing
you'll always deny we're going in circles
but i'll override
could be winter but i burn inside
in the back of my mind, i hear nothing
keep this feeling alive, i fear nothing now
then i'm in my ride

gettin' on this plane, making moves
cry and talk about it, baby, but it ain't no use

if it ain't your life i don't know how to live it
and it broke me down, i almost drowned
it's not the ending, it's not the ending

the secrets i hide, i do nothing
you'll always deny that we're going in circles
but i'll override
could be winter but i burn inside
in the back of my mind, i hear nothing
keep this feeling alive, i fear nothing now
it's a race against time when you're on the frontline

couldn't take it back even though you wish i could
if you think i'm going back, you misunderstood
cry and talk about it, baby, but it ain't no use

i suppose i should tell you
what this bitch is thinking
you'll find me in the studio
and not in the kitchen
i won't be bragging 'bout my cars
or talking 'bout my chains
don t need to shake my ass for you
'cause i've got a brain
if i told you 'bout my sex life
you'd call me a slut
when boys be talking 'bout their bitches
no one's making a fuss
there's a glass ceiling to break, uh huh
there's money to make
and now it s time to speed it up

if you're not a size six
then you're not good looking
well, you better be rich
or be real good at cooking
you should probably lose some weight
'cause we can't see your bones
you should probably fix your face
or you'll end up on your own
don't you want to have somebody who objectifies you?
have you thought about your butt; who's gonna tear it in two?
we've never had it so good, uh huh
we're out of the woods
and if you can't detect the sarcasm
then you've misunderstood

sometimes, it's hard to find the words to say
i'll go ahead and say them anyway
forget your balls and grow a pair of tits
it's hard, it's hard
it's hard out here for a bitch

it's hard for a bitch  for a bitch

call your girlfriend
it's time you had the talk
give your reasons
say it's not her fault
but you just met somebody new

tell her not to get upset
second guessing everything you said and done
and then when she gets upset
tell her how you never mean to hurt no one

then you tell her that the only way her heart will mend
is when she learns to love again
and it won't make sense right now but you're still her friend
and then you let her down easy

call your girlfriend
it's time you had the talk
give your reasons
say it's not her fault
but you just met somebody new

don't you tell her how i give you something
that you never even knew you missed
don't you even try and explain
how it's so different when we kiss

you just tell her that the only way her heart will mend
is when she learns to love again
and it won't make sense right now but you're still her friend
and then you let her down easy

call your girlfriend
it's time you had the talk
give your reasons
say it's not her fault
but you just met somebody new

and now it's gonna be me and you...

and you tell her that the only way her heart will mend
is when she learns to love again
and it won't make sense right now but you're still her friend
and then you let her down easy

call...
call your girlfriend  your girlfriend 
it's time you had the talk
give your reasons
say it's not her fault
call your girlfriend
it's time you had the talk
give your reasons
say it's not her fault

but you just met somebody new


what am i supposed to say?
an old love called me yesterday
and she sounds so sweet
why, she sounds so...
 
drill me to the floor
this hurts even more than i expected it to do
 ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh 

 ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh 
 ooh ooh ooh  drill me to the floor
 ooh ooh ooh  this hurts even more, oh
oh, oh, oh oh oh
oh, oh, oh oh oh
oh, oh, oh oh oh
oh, oh, oh oh oh
oh, oh, oh oh oh
oh, oh, oh oh oh
oh, oh, oh oh oh
oh, oh oh

like the moon says to the dark, we will never be apart
we'll never be alone again
cause it was you who'd call me out
when i couldn't shut my mouth
about the last love that did me in
i couldn't sleep, you said, "just sleep with me"
i couldn't speak, you said, "i'm listening"
and if it breaks me down i'll be around
until it's you love, you're my new love
 + 
 
old love
it's been so long
why you gotta call
and hurt me hurt me, hurt me?
and i love you still
why, i love you..


pristine
untraced by the world outside you
anyways
i'll never get real
and you'll never change to me 'cause i'm not looking
anyways

same night
same humility for those that love you
anyways, anyways
and if you do find someone better
i'll still see you in everything
tomorrow and all the time

don't you like me for me?
is there any better feeling than coming clean?
and i know myself and i'll never love anyone else
i won't love anyone else
i'll never love anyone else

it just feels like
the same party every weekend
doesn't it? doesn't it?
and if you do find someone better
i'll still see you in everything
for always, tomorrow and all the time

don't you like me for me?
is there any better feeling than coming clean?
and i know myself and i'll never love anyone else
i won't love anyone else
i'll never love anyone else

if it's not supposed to be
then i'll just let it be
and out of everyone
be honest with me
who do you change for?
who's top of your world?
and out of everyone
who's your type of girl?

we can be anything
even apart
out of everything
it doesn't have to be this hard
i could be anyone
but i'm so entwined
and out of everyone
who's on your mind?
no more changes
i'll still love you the same


sometimes a mystery, sometimes i'm free
depending on my mood or my attitude
sometimes i wanna roll or stay at home
walking contradiction, guess i m factual and fiction

a little crazy, little sexy, little cool
little rough around the edges but i keep it smooth
i m always left of center and that s right where i belong
i m the random minor note you hear in major songs

and i like that
i don t really give a fuck if i was just the only one
who likes that
i never like to follow, follow, i would rather chase the sun
oh me, oh me, oh me, oh my
oh me, oh me, oh me, oh my
oh me, oh me, oh me, oh my
i like that

i don t care what i look like, but i feel good
better than amazing, and better than i could
told the whole world, i m the venom and the antidote
take a different type of girl to keep the whole world afloat

'cause i m crazy and i m sexy then i m cool
little rough around the edges but i keep it smooth
i m always left of center and that s right where i belong
i m the random minor note you hear in major songs

and i like that
i don t really give a fuck if i was just the only one
who likes that
i never like to follow, follow, i would rather chase the sun
oh me, oh me, oh me, oh my
oh me, oh me, oh me, oh my
oh me, oh me, oh me, oh my
i like that

i remember when you called me weird
we was in math class, third row, i was sitting by you
right before mr. ammond s class
'cause my mama couldn t afford new js
polos, thrift store, thrift clothes that was all i knew
do you remember?
uh, i remember when you laughed when i cut my perm off
and you rated me a six
i was like,  damn 
but even back then with the tears in my eyes
i always knew i was the shit

i like that
i don t really give a fuck if i was just the only one
who likes that
i never like to follow, follow, i would rather chase the sun
oh me, oh me, oh me, oh my
oh me, oh me, oh me, oh my
oh me, oh me, oh me, oh my
i like that


you're up, but you'll get down
you're never running from this town
and i think you said
you'll never get anything better than this
'cause you're going 'round in circles
and everyone knows you're trouble

because you read it in a big book
and now you're giving me the look, look
but just remember how we shook, shook
and all the things we took, took
this town's the oldest friend of mine

we get up and we get down
we're always running 'round this town
and to think they said
we'd never make anything better than this
'cause we're always in small circles
and everyone thinks we're trouble

we didn't read it in a big book
 we didn't read it in a big book, big book, big book 
and now we're giving you the look, look
 giving you the look, ah, giving you the look, ah ah 
just remember how we shook, shook
 shook, shook, shook, shook 
and all the things we took, took
 took, took, took, took 
 this town, this town 
this town's the oldest friend of mine

this town, this town, this town



i needed someone to depend upon
i was alone, i was emotional
searching for the right emoticon
to expand my mental lexicon

then gemma told me that she met someone
it was the person i'd been counting on
it felt good, it felt transitional
a feeling i'd been waiting on

you were floating like a lilo
with your eyes closed, going where the tide goes
caught in flux, you drifted 'til you hit the sides
hold my breath another minute
i can keep my head, there's nothing in it
i'm a patient wave
and it's an easy ride

i saw myself an intellectual
i thought that i was capable
every move was just habitual
and life was just a ritual

then gemma told me that she met somebody
nobody else could take me from myself
i wasn't searching for it anymore
the feeling i'd been waiting for

you were floating like a lilo
with your eyes closed, going where the tide goes
caught in flux, you drifted 'til you hit the sides
hold my breath another minute
i can keep my head, there's nothing in it
i'm a patient wave  i'm a patient wave 
and it's an easy ride

floating like a lilo with you
going where the tide goes
floating like a lilo with you
going where the tide goes
floating like a 
floating like a 
floating like a 
floating like a 

you were floating like a lilo
with your eyes closed, going where the tide goes
caught in flux, you drifted 'til you hit the sides
hold my breath another minute
i can keep my head, there's nothing in it
i'm a patient wave  i'm a patient wave 
and it's an easy ride

i'm not your nervous feeling
each time we say goodnight
you picture buildings burning to the ground
from the basement to the streetlight
i'm not your drinking problem
a hole is in the sky
it's not your heart that you've been thinkin of
just the feeling like you're gonna die
all you know how to do is
shake shake
keep your body still, keep your body still
all you do is
shake shake shake
keep your body still, keep your body still
i'm not your paranoia
when someone's at the door
virgin fires calling out the throat of a body rising through the floor
i'm not your fortune teller
i'm not your spinning bed
i'm never like you
uncomfortable too
this is starting to fuck with my head
all you know how to do is
shake shake
keep your body still, keep your body still
all you do is
shake shake shake
keep your body still, keep your body still
don't you realize you're fine
oh can't you see that you're fine
and know that you're still alive
you know that you're still alive
oh don't you know you're alive
don't you know you're alive
burning in the sky


all of us girls
we're in and out of love
we're vulnerable
but we'll tell you that we're tough
some of these guys
never think that they'll get caught
think that we're blind
but they're forgetting that we talk
 sing it with me 

if he never calls when he says he will
if he always tells you to keep it chill
if you see him out with another girl
baby, then you know he was never real
if he never wants you to meet his friends
if he ain't tagging you on the 'gram
take your heart and turn around while you still can

and tell him, tell him, tell him, tell him
i got somewhere else to be
and i don't, i don't, i don't, i don't
lose my head for nobody
yeah, if you have to question
"is he loyal to me?"
well then, he's probably not
and you should probably leave

says he's online
but he told you he's asleep
you stay inside
like he never wants you to be seen
ain't got a job, no
says he 'models on the side'
swears you're the one
but he's not the label type
 sing it with me 

if he never calls when he says he will
if he always tells you to keep it chill
if you see him out with another girl
baby, then you know he was never real
hope you never let those pictures send
he'll only go show them to his friends
take your heart and turn around while you still can

and tell him, tell him, tell him, tell him
i got somewhere else to be
and i don't, i don't, i don't, i don't
lose my head for nobody
yeah, if you have to question
"is he loyal to me?"
well then he's probably not
and you should probably leave

yeah, ha, ooh, oooh
yeah, ooh, oooh, ooh
yeah, ooh, oooh
yeah, ooh, oooh
they re not, they re not, loyal, to me
they re not, they re not, loyal, to me
they re not, they re not, loyal, to me
they re not, they re not, loyal

and tell him, tell him, tell him, tell him
i got somewhere else to be
and i don't, i don't, i don't, i don't
lose my head for nobody

yeah, if you have to question
"is he loyal to me?"
well then he's probably not
and you should probably leave

yeah, ha, ooh, oooh
yeah, ooh, oooh, ooh
yeah, if you have to question
"is he loyal to me?"
well then he's probably not
and you should probably leave

the mystery of time
but now the quiet hours, stay a littler a longer
til the darker days come and go again when they say

when i'm here feeling ordinary, no
don t try and hold me, if you're gonna hold me back
just tell me it's only temporary

so i've changed my mind
see it differently
on the other side
you're not listening to me
'cause when the ropes all break
nothing's gonna catch
with my hands untied
is anything the same? just

tell me it's only temporary
when i m here feeling ordinary, no
don t try and hold me, if you're gonna hold me back

don't try and hold me, if you're gonna hold me back
just tell me it's only temporary

the ferns are greedy
they all want something from me
these trees are dirty
want me to have a baby
her kids are lonely
they all want something from me
their eyes are beady
their stares they pierce right through me

but i don't have anything left to give
i'm like an old bone
in the back of the fridge
and i could ask for what i want
so you could tell me what you need
but there's no use trying anymore
like an old bone
in the back of the fridge
and i've got no home
if it's not with you

your friends are greedy
they all want something from me
these streets are dirty
want me to have a baby
her kids are lonely
they all want something from me
their eyes are beady
their stares they pierce right through me

but i don't have anything left to give
i'm like an old bone
in the back of the fridge
and i could ask for what i want
so you could tell me what you need
but there's no use crying anymore
i'm just an old bone
in the back of the fridge
and i've got no home
if it's not with you


save your breath, my brother, it's not going in
i'm not your disciple, i choose how i sin
i've got a distant memory of previous lives
so don't say i'm not ready, back off with those knives

you don't know me like you used to
you can leave, but i refuse to
you can tell me that i'm crazy
but i won't stop and this won't make me

ooh hoo, hoo
oh oh oh, don't tell me i'm not ready
ooh hoo, hoo
oh oh oh, don't tell me i'm not ready
for love, for love

i don't feel connected to all of your lies
but you can do a kindness and look me in the eyes
my soul's resurrected, yeah, it's been there before
so don't say i'm not ready till i fall on my sword

you don't know me like you used to
yeah, you can leave, but i refuse to
you can tell me that i'm crazy
but i won't stop and this won't make me

oh, ooh hoo, hoo
oh oh oh, don't tell me i'm not ready
ooh hoo, hoo
oh oh oh, don't tell me i'm not ready for love

the course that you have set for me, the shadows you cast over me
the road is getting hard to see, but i'm gonna make it through
horizons that are outta sight, lost behind the fading light
i'm ready for what's coming, and they best be ready too

ooh hoo, hoo
oh oh oh, don't tell me i'm not ready for love
ooh hoo, hoo  for love, for love 
oh oh oh, don't tell me i'm not ready for love
ooh hoo, hoo

ooh hoo, hoo
oh oh oh, don't tell me i'm not ready for love


been sleeping over for the past couple of weeks
making a habit out of it, yeah
when i woke up, i saw your toothbrush on the sink
it kinda scared me, i'll admit

if there's a line, then i think that we crossed it
second time you stayed the night
if there's a cool, then i think that i lost it
and i should take my own advice

let's stop before it gets m m m m messy
let's stop before it gets h h h h heavy
it's not too late to say you never met me
let's stop before it gets m m m m m m messy

i try to tell myself "you gotta take it slow"
i always jump in way too fast, yeah
if you wake up and i'm not there, it's nothing personal
just got some problems from my past, yeah

if there's a line, then i think that we crossed it
second time you stayed the night
if there's a cool, then i think that i lost it
and i should take my own advice

let's stop before it gets m m m m messy
let's stop before it gets h h h h heavy
it's not too late to say you never met me
let's stop before it gets m m m m m m messy

messy
to say you never met me, messy
before it gets  m m m m m m messy 

if there's a line, then i think that we crossed it
second time you stayed the night
if there's a cool, then i think that i lost it
and i should take my own advice

let's stop before it gets m m m m messy
let's stop before it gets h h h h heavy
it's not too late to say you never met me
let's stop before it gets m m m m m m messy


i never let
my guard go down
but you messed me up
when you came around
when the high wore off
know you needed space
but i don't wanna wait
i don't wanna mistake

few thousand miles, and an ocean away
but i see the sunrise, just like the other day
picture your eyes as i fall asleep
tell myself it's alright
as the tears roll by

oh, oh, oh
i wish i could feel your face
oh, oh, oh
i'm helpless when i'm oceans away

i never felt
a room so still
see the future coming
hope it isn't real
i learned to fake a smile
as the time runs out
i don't wanna wait
oh, i don't wanna mistake

few thousand miles and an ocean away
but i see the sunrise, just like the other day
picture your eyes as i fall asleep
tell myself it's alright, as the tears roll by

oh, oh, oh
i wish i could feel your face
oh, oh, oh
i'm helpless when i'm oceans away
oh, oh, oh
i wish i could feel your face
oh, oh, oh
i'm helpless when i'm oceans away
helpless when i'm oceans away
i'm helpless when i'm oceans away

oh, oh, oh
i wish i could feel your face
oh, oh, oh
i'm helpless when i'm oceans away


so i heard you found somebody else
and at first i thought it was a lie
so i took all my things that make sounds
and the rest i can do without

i don't want your body
but i hate to think about you with somebody else
a love gone cold
you're intertwining your soul with somebody else
i'm looking through you while you're looking through your phone
and leaving with somebody else
no i don't want your body
but i hate to think about you with somebody else

come on, baby
this ain't the last time that i'll see your face
come on, baby
you said you'd find someone to take my place
oh i don't believe that you have got it in you
cause we are just gonna keep doin' it and every time
i start to believe in anything you're sayin'
i'm reminded that i should be gettin' over it

i don't want your body
but i hate to think about you with somebody else
a love gone cold
you're intertwining your soul with somebody else
i'm looking through you while you're looking through your phone
and leaving with somebody else
no i don't want your body
but i hate to think about you with somebody else
somebody else
somebody else
somebody else

get someone you love
get someone you need
fuck that, get money
cause i can't give you my soul cause we're never alone
get someone you love
get someone you need
fuck that, get money
cause i can't give you my soul cause we're never alone
get someone you love
get someone you need

chill out, what you yelling for?
lay back, it's all been done before
and if, you could only let it be, you will see
i like, you the way you are
when we're, driving in your car
and you're, talking to me one on one
but you've become

somebody else, 'round everyone else
you're watching your back, like you can't relax
you're trying to be cool, you look like a fool to me
tell me

why do you have to go and make things so complicated?
i see the way you're acting like you're somebody else gets me frustrated
life's like this you

somebody else, 'round everyone else
you're watching your back, like you can't relax
you're trying to be cool, you look like a fool to me

why do you have to go and make things so complicated?
i see the way you're acting like you're somebody else gets me frustrated

making love until the morning light
making out like it's the end of the world
and i really wanna get it right
but it's getting hard to slow down
got me feeling like it's real for sure
this is getting kinda out of my head
i'm out of my head

when i'm close to you

we're lost civilians with the weight of millions
we're pawns in war living in denial

i can feel it coming, we can never go back
i can feel it coming, we can never go back

baby, it's so real to me
now that it's over
the space where you used to be
your head on my shoulder
all of the plans we made
that never happened
now your scent on my pillow's faded
at least you left me with something

there's this empty space you left behind
now you're not here with me
i keep digging through our waste of time
but the picture's incomplete
there's this empty space you left behind
now you're not here with me
i keep digging through our waste of time
but the picture's incomplete
'cause i'm missing you
i miss you

can't make sense of all of the pieces
of my own delusions
can't take all these memories
don't know how to use  em
there's a slick washed up onto the beach
i follow the traces
finding clues in my pockets and opening boxes
and going places we went
remember to forget
thinking how it could been
i've turned all my sorrow into glass
it don't leave no shadow

there's this empty space you left behind
now you're not here with me
i keep digging through our waste of time
but the picture's incomplete
there's this empty space you left behind
now you're not here with me
i keep digging through our waste of time
but the picture's incomplete
'cause i'm missing you
i miss you

 i miss you 
this part of you, this clock that stopped
this residue, it's all i've got
 i miss you 
this part of you, this clock that stopped
 clock that stopped 
this residue  it's all i got 
it's all i've got

there's this empty space you left behind
 this part of you, this clock that stopped 
i keep thinking you're still right beside me
 this residue, it's all i got 
you're still there
there's this empty space you left behind
 this part of you, this clock that stopped 
all the love you gave, it still defines me
there's this empty space you left behind
i keep thinking you're still right beside me
there's this empty space you left behind
i keep thinking you're still right beside me
there's this empty space you left behind
all the love you gave, it still defines me


in the darkness, i can't avoid your eyes
under bedsheets, i can't escape the time
can we just sit, not talk about it
you know i hate goodbyes

if i answered yes, would it change your mind
if i said don't go, would you stay behind

now i'm burning up inside, you lit the fire
before you go, i gotta let you know that
every time, every time, every time
i should've said what i meant
every time, every time, every time
got caught up in my head

in the last hour, i don't know what to say
as the sun casts a shadow on your face
can we rewind, go back to last night
this morning came too fast

if i told you yes, would it change your mind
if i said i'm yours, would you stay behind

i, i, i'm yours
i, i, i'm yours
i, i, i'm yours if you need more, if you need more
don't let me go
don't let me go
don't let me go if you need more

now i'm burning up inside, you lit the fire
before you go, i gotta let you know that
every time, every time, every time
i should've said what i meant
every time, every time, every time
got caught up in my head
you lit the fire
burning up, burning up, you lit the fire


waking up next to you every morning
how did we get this far? it came without a warning
and in the nighttime, you tell me your whole life
you and me get too real but all i feel is alright

my heart's a secret, mmm
i think i'm coming alive, yeah
i think i'm coming alive with you
tell me you'll keep it, mmm
i think i'm coming alive, yeah
i come alive with you

don't give it up, don't say it hurts
'cause there's nothing like this feeling, baby
now that i found you
i want it all
no, there's nothing like this feeling, baby
now that i found you
now that i found you
now that i found you

give me the words i want, baby, just say it
you know me way too well to keep it complicated
i don't wanna hide my love
i don't wanna waste it  i don't wanna waste it 
but i can't deny the moment when i taste it

my heart's a secret, mmm

caught out, at 23
eye of a lion, dancing queen
young mind, in the backyard
you've always been the king of it, playing hard

i know it, you're made of it, born with it
i know it
i know it, you rise from it, pray on it
i know it, you leave with no trace of it

it's the power of you
reign in gold, beautiful
it's the fight in you

wild heart, dressed in jewels
she on a mission, don't you know ruby rules?
fire up, turn it back around
we can see you rising up above the crowd
you're far away but we can hear you shout

i know it, i m made of it, born with it
i know it
i know it, i'll rise from it, pray on it
i know it, i ll leave with no trace of it

it's the power of you
reign in gold, beautiful
it's the fight in you

don't go easily
please stay with me
we live so dangerously
magic inside
you are a king of your kind
won't be staying behind
 i know it 
i know it, you're made of it, i swear on it

it's the power of you
it's the fight in you


i know what you wanna say
i think that you're all the same
constantly being led astray
you think you know something you don't

downtown hotspot halfway up the street
i used to be free, i used to be seventeen
follow my shadow round your corner
i used to be seventeen, now you're just like me

down beneath the ashes and the stone
sure of what i've lived and have known
i see you so uncomfortably alone
i wish i could show you how much you've grown

downtown hotspot used to be on this street
i used to be seventeen, i used to be seventeen
now you're a hotshot hanging on my block
sun coming up, who's my shadow?

la la la la la la la
la la la la la la la
la la la la la la la
la la la la la la la

i know what you're gonna be
i know that you're gonna be
you'll crumble it up just to see
afraid that you'll be just like me

downtown hotspot halfway through this life
i used to feel free, or was it just a dream?
now you're a hotshot, think you're so carefree
but you're just seventeen, so much like me
you're just seventeen, you're just seventeen
seventeen


i don't see my friends no more, at all
ever since i let you go, you know

i'm drifting in the deep, tryna find a way home
driving through the streets, nowhere i wanna go
felt like all i need is how i had it before
thought that i'd feel free, but the freedom comes slow

lately, i've been leaning on myself  oh 
lately, i don't need nobody else
just trying not to feel the way i felt  oh 
lately, i've been leaning on myself
leaning on myself

lately i've been fine, i've been filling up my free time
wasting all my money, playing in the sunshine

i'm drifting in the deep, tryna find a way home
driving through the streets, nowhere i wanna go
felt like all i need is how i had it before
thought that i'd feel free, but the freedom comes slow

lately, i've been leaning on myself  oh 
lately, i don't need nobody else
just trying not to feel the way i felt  oh 
lately, i've been leaning on myself
leaning on myself

oh, oh
oh, oh
oh, oh

lately, i've been leaning on myself  oh, oh 
lately, i don't need nobody else
just trying not to feel the way i felt  oh, oh 
lately, i've been leaning on myself
leaning on myself

watching through a window
the flashing light on the bed
neon sign goes red

selling years of ideas  til i m old, a living on the shelf

everything means everything
or nothing means nothing
so why hide your expletives under your breath?
cause all you ever wanna do
is take all my clothes off
so you can show me
there s no reason to be upset

you could convince me to
tie my hair back
relive the years i ve left behind
you could convince me to
stay up all night with you
while you leave me
underdressed and out of time

underdressed and i'm all out of time
take me to the fucking roof
made it
give me just a little truth
leave me
underdressed and i'm all out of time
take me to a different view
change it
all i ever wanna do
is stay here  stay, stay, stay here. 

everything means everything
and nothing is numbing
can t avoid the consequence
so don t get upset
cause all you ever wanna do
is take all my clothes off
watch me make you promises
i can regret

you could convince me to
tie my hair back
relive the years i ve left behind
you could convince me to
stay up all night with you
while you leave me
underdressed and out of time

it's getting hard for me
to reframe all those shifting memories
like a music box that
never starts dancing by itself
what a broken world, what a broken world
but it's my own
just to see you, to see through you
i step inside

letting go, i want to be happier now
i want to be more than close
surreal, the way you made me out
the way you crash me down

it's getting hard for me
to remember all of the names from my life
you've been so many
different kinds of people in my mind

letting go, i want to be happier now
i want to be more than close
surreal, the way you made me out
letting go, i want to be happier now
i want to be more than close
surreal, the way you made me out
the way you crash me down


letting go, i want to be happier now
i want to be more than close
surreal, the way you made me out
letting go, i want to be happier now
i want to be more than close
surreal, the way you made me out


i hate you for what you did
and i miss you like a little kid
i faked it every time but that's alright
i can hardly feel anything
i hardly feel anything at all

you gave me fifteen hundred
to see your hypnotherapist
i only went one time, you let it slide
fell on hard times a year ago
was hoping you would let it go and you did

i have emotional motion sickness
somebody roll the windows down
there are no words in the english language
i could scream to drown you out

i'm on the outside looking through
you're throwing rocks around your room
and while you're bleeding on your back in the glass
i'll be glad that i made it out
and sorry that it all went down like it did

i have emotional motion sickness
somebody roll the windows down
there are no words in the english language
i could scream to drown you out

and why do you sing with an english accent
i guess it's too late to change it now
you know i'm never gonna let you have it
but i will try to drown you out

you said when you met me you were bored
you said when you met me you were bored
and you you were in a band when i was born

i have emotional motion sickness
i try to stay clean and live without
and i want to know what would happen
if i surrender to the sound
surrender to the sound

got a piece of my mind, to tell you who's mine
nobody hurts like me for you.
soft slacks at night, i'm wearing 'em tight
nobody hurts like i do.
your fakers are fine, but your water ain't wine
so stop feeding me, 'a little more time'
your shit's a mess, i'm not yours to undress
i'm leaving this love for the last time.
i'm not yours, i'm mine.
you've got the means to caress, but weak you leave me a mess
one touch is enough, your hands, a little too rough
will i ever be enough?
i'm not yours, i'm mine
we fall the fader to black, release the ropes and feel the slack
i'm not yours, i'm mine
i tell you every time, you're walking a fine, fine line
i'm not yours, i'm mine
i'm not yours
heard it all before
heard it all before
heard it all before
heard it all before


daniel, when i first saw you
i knew that you had a flame in your heart
and under wild blue skies
marble movie skies
i found a home in your eyes
and we'd never be apart

and when the fires came
the smell of cinders and rain
perfumed almost everything
we laughed and laughed and laughed

and in the golden blue
car you took me to
the darkest place you knew
and set fire to my heart

when i run in the dark, daniel
into a place that's lost, daniel
under a sheet of rain in my heart, daniel
i dream of home

but in a goodbye bed
with my arms around your neck
into our mouths the tears crept
just kids in the eye of the storm

and as the house spun round
my dreams pulled me from the ground
forever to search for the flame
for home again 
for home again 

when i run in the dark, daniel
into a place that's lost, daniel
under a sheet of rain in my heart, daniel
i dream of home
when i run in the dark, daniel
into a place that's lost, daniel
under a sheet of rain in my heart, daniel
i dream of home


i hear the drizzle of the rain
it's falling from my window
and in the corners of my mind
i hope that i'll get to see you again
la da di da di da di da di my friend
i hear the colors in the flowers
just like the candle snuffed at dawn
you're here, you're near, you're there and then you're gone
la da die da die da die da die

suffering in sinking sand
all the hurt
see, i'm really lost, baby
we suffered a rare, rare blue
so much hurt
on this earth
but you loved me
and i really dared to love you, too
perhaps what i mean to say is
is that it's amazing that your love was mine

oh, maker, tell me did you know
this love would burn so yellow?
becoming orange and, in its time
explode from grey to black then bloody wine
la da di da di da di da di
oh, maker, have you ever loved
or known just what it was?
i can't imagine the bitter end
of all the beauty that we're living in
oh, no

suffering in sinking sand
all the hurt
see, i'm really lost, baby
we suffered a rare, rare blue
so much hurt
on this earth
but you loved me
and i really dared to love you, too
perhaps what i mean to say is
is that it's amazing that your love was mine

lost inside a lonely world where lovers pay the price
barely get the sound of music to love and go dance to
now it's time for us to go and no one ever has to know
your love's in my pocket and your eyes, eyes are in my
eyes in my soul, no one will know it but me


 you really, you really 
 you really, you really 

your pussy is god and i love it
gonna kiss me real hard, make me want it
i think star signs mean nothing
but i know you feel right so i'm coming
they say it gets hard when you're getting up
been knocked down from some other love
but their best wasn't good enough
and you're number one to me

you're extra special, something else
or maybe it's you
and i've been looking for something i want
and baby, it's you, um

your pussy is god, and you know
i think you're so cute when you get high
i've never been good at this nice shit
but i can try if you like it
sayin' it gets hard when you give a fuck
get knocked down from some other love
but their best wasn't good enough
and you're number one to me

 you really, you really 
 you really taught me how to 
you know that it's god, baby, when you're around her
 you really, you really 
i've been praying for hours
 you really taught me how to 
you know that it's god, baby, when you're around her
she's god and i've found her, oh
 you really, you really 

your pussy is god, and i'm falling
we're on the same wave when we're talking
i've never been played in a good match
but i win when i hear you say
i'm cool if you love me, oh
knocked down from some other love
but their best wasn't good enough
and you're better off with me

you're extra special, something else
or maybe it's you
and i've been looking for something i want
and baby, it's you, um

 you really taught me how to 
you know that it's god, baby, when you're around her

nothing feels good, it's not right

watching my world
make funny faces at its own reflection
 nothing feels good, it's not right 
so i'll follow my girl
'til i find myself a sense of direction
 nothing feels good, it's not right 

i found a subsidence but i overlooked it
someone gave me guidance and for once i took it
i put it in perspective and i see so clearly
i'm part of a collective, oh i nearly reached it
in the distance, caught the light
i can fix it, make it right

watching my world
make funny faces at its own reflection
 nothing feels good, it's not right 
so i'll follow my girl
'til i find myself a sense of direction
 nothing feels good, it's not right 
watching my world
make funny faces at its own reflection
so i'll follow my girl
'til i find myself a sense of direction

nothing feels good, i can't fix it, it s not right
right
nothing feels good, i can't fix it, it s not right
right

watching my world
make funny faces at its own reflection
 nothing feels good, it's not right 
so i'll follow my girl
'til i find myself a sense of direction
 nothing feels good, it's not right

when the sky was gold
and i needed no protection
but as the wind would blow
a thousand miles in no direction
man, it was a beautiful sight
days were soaked in sunlight
just so long ago
but lately i like to imagine

when i was young
whatever happened it would do me no wrong
as long as i could sing my favorite song
when i was young, oh
and the holidays went on and on
we were so high
let the freeway take us into the night
and in the dark you sang my favorite song
when i was young, oh
and the holidays went on and on
and on, and on, and on
when i was young

but honestly, it doesn t hurt me  no

on the path of no returnin , oh, oh

and in the dark you sang my favorite song
when i was young, oh
and the holidays went on and on
and on, and on, and on
when i was young
 woo  

when i was young
we would play with fire
when i was young
and we would fuck the price
when i was young
it was do or die
i would give my life just to feel like
when i was young

ohh, oh oh oh oh
 oh, do or die 
when i was young
do me no wrong
we were so high
oh, and the holidays went on and on
and on, and on, and on
when i was young

i feel, i feel the ending
before it even starts
my jacket's under the table
your sneakers are right where they usually are
we're a touch away from naked
one touch from never changing
yeah, we know we shouldn't but
we're always letting us down
drop our two cents on the carpet
in your studio apartment
yeah, we know we shouldn't 'cause

we go from hot, hot
to slam and shut the doors till they crack
we go from love, love
to saying shit that we can't take back
but every time that we walk out
we just keep coming back
like we forget to forget
forget to forget about us
each time, time
promise this time will be the last
'cause we both know
it's a mistake waking up in this bed
but every time that we walk out
we just keep coming back
like we forget to forget
forget to forget about us

i know, i know this bedroom
better than i know mine
your boyhood still in the wardrobe
you hid it away like you usually do
we're a touch away from naked
one touch from never changing
yeah, we know we shouldn't but
we're always letting us down
drop our two cents on the carpet
in your studio apartment
yeah, we know we shouldn't 'cause

we go from hot, hot

now tell me something
is there a point to this?
or are we living for the feeling
when we look back
on what we did and reminisce?

'cause i ve looked within and i've read
but instead i keep focusing
on just how thin i can get
now i'm looking for something else
i found myself: i m someone else

i keep looking for something
even though i know that it's not there
 maybe you're the reason 
every time i try to figure it out
you're the only thing i can think about
 maybe you're the reason 

and i think i'm dying
'cause this can't be living
should i be searching for
some kind of meaning?
apathy s a funny feeling

i turned my gaze to the ceiling
thanked a god i don t believe in
for the scene outside
i tried my best at sleeping but
my dreams were unappealing
so i searched for people in the landscape
passers by

i keep looking for something
even though i know that it's not there
 maybe you re the reason 
every time i try to figure it out
you're the only thing i can think about
 maybe you're the reason 


i keep looking for something
even though i know that it's not there
 maybe you re the reason 
every time i try to figure it out
you're the only thing i can think about

on your marks
get set 

step up, lover
big talker, take a number
i've got all day
to wipe the smile off your face
if i win, you're done with
but if you win, you win my heart
isn't that what you want 

hey romeo
put on your running shoes
i'm ready to go
hey romeo
put on your running shoes
i'm ready to go
i'm ready to go

the only way he
can catch up to me is to cheat
there is no veto
what's done is done once i am beat
so roll me, race me
with all your tricks and all your heart
i'm not wishing you luck

put on your running shoes
i'm ready to go

got no need for the fancy things
all the attention that it brings
tell me no, i say yes, i was chosen
and i will deliver the explosion
can't say it's gonna get me far
do no good to say what you are
i run the streets and i break up houses
river runs deep and the flame devours it

me, i'm a creator
thrill is to make it up
the rules i break got me a place
up on the radar
me, i'm a taker

can't roll it back, it's understood
got to play our cards

here all the folks come ask about me
band wagon, know they used to doubt me
blind side tend to hit real hard
you should heed the warning, get a body guard
steady friction in this bitch
creepin' in just like an itch
so far i got the last laugh
still the rich rise up, still i live fast
wouldn't know it face to face
got no soul and got no taste
moving in speed up the pace
i got it locked though, what a waste
all the talk is standard fare
walk the walk if it gets you there
on the grind till the gig is up
i'm 'a smash 'em down
put a muzzle on them like "what "

with her head in her scars
ava studies her palm
as she waits on the window seat
pebble thrown overarm
her face is stark in alarm
she says,  what do you want from me?"
i said
why'd you take it as final when you're starting to spiral
girl, why can't you see?
you know i know you can do it
and i'll help you get through this
whether it's
once or twice or again
again, no

moonlight in the garden
grass beneath your toes
girl in shame says,  they can't see me like this 
"well, if you slip or stall, i'll be holding your hands"
i'll be holding your
mmm, mmm, i

a couple summers have passed
and i can't place the car
as i walk past her balcony
words long lost in this air
a little breeze in my hair
is i think what she might've been
i wonder where she's been living
and if she's still wishing for no one to see?
i know i have to accept this
but if she'd have let me

i'd be there
once or twice or again
again


some things don't sit right
this close to midnight
you're someone else in this light   oh, oh oh 
stand in the kitchen
attempting to fix this
so i try to listen to you, you, you
but

you're gonna say something you don't mean
so just before you take it too far, i'll hold my ears say "la da da di da"
your empty words made for hurting me
so just before you take it too far, i'll hold my ears say "la da da di da"
la da da di da, la da da di da, la da da di da, la da da di da
la da da di da, la da da di da
hold my ears say "la da da di"

it's just like you
to take me down with you
feed off each other's issues  oh, oh, oh 
we both know there's no use
talkin' 'bout what i owe you
i want back the old you
you, you, you
but

you're gonna say something you don't mean
so just before you take it too far, i'll hold my ears say "la da da di da"
your empty words made for hurting me

la da da di da, la da da di da, la da da di da, la da da di da
la da da di da, la da da di da
hold my ears say "la da da di"

busy doing damage
instead of repairing you and i
then you go and take advantage of me and i can't stand it
every time

you're gonna say something you don't mean
so just before you take it too far, i'll hold my ears say "la da da di da"
your empty words made for hurting me

used to be vulnerable
used to be dumb
i used to give it all, mmm
hot like a firestone
100 degrees
oh but now i'm so cold when they kiss me, they touch me, they freeze
they say

why'd you never trust?
why'd you never love?
why'd you never let 'em in?
why'd you wake up with somebody in your bed again?
and say you love them till you leave
why you out so late
dancing with your fake friends
getting in a state?
when the good guys come why'd you run away?
why'd you hurt them?
well i'll tell you

when you're young and you get your heart  broken
and he leaves, leaves the scars open
when you can't believe it's over
that's when you get a little colder
yeah, when your heart's broken
and he leaves, leaves the scars open
drunk cry crying on his shoulder
that's when you get a little colder

they'd have to break me down
show me real love
oh, but lately these boys, all they do is they fuck my head up
they say

why'd you never trust?
why'd you never love?
why'd you never let  em in?
why'd you wake up with somebody in your bed again?
and say you love them till you leave
don't you wanna stay?
don't you wanna try?
putting up a fight
deep down you know
you know you could make it right
don't just give in

i'd turn the music up, get high and try not to listen
to every little fight 'cause neither one was right

i swore i'd never be like them
but i was just a kid back then

the older i get, the more that i see
my parents aren't heroes, they're just like me
and loving is hard, it don't always work
you just try your best not to get hurt
i used to be mad, but now i know
sometimes it's better to let someone go
it just hadn't hit me yet
the older i get

i used to wonder why, why they could never be happy
i used to close my eyes and pray for a whole 'nother family
where everything was fine, one that felt like mine

i swore i'd never be like them
but i was just a kid back then

the older i get, the more that i see
my parents aren't heroes, they're just like me
and loving is hard, it don't always work

this time it don t feel like you want it all
did i do something wrong to make you go?
said i would know when it's all good to fall
now i just need you here to hold me close

cause i don't want another heart to fill the holes
that you left under my covers for me to grow cold
i don't wanna miss somebody who's not missing me
but the city feels so lonely when you leave

my room, where i want you
tangled ease in my sheets
in your shirt that i got you
half asleep, holding onto me
my bed where you left me
tangled up, now it's noon
in your shirt that you gave me
half asleep, wishing i still had you

half asleep, wishing i still had you

this time you said you re playing games again
what are we becoming of it now?
it's fine, i said, if you're the one in my head
cause i just don't know how to put you out

cause i don't want another heart to fill the holes
that you left under my covers for me to grow cold
i don't wanna miss somebody who's not missing me
but the city feels so lonely when you leave

we were staying in paris
to get away from your parents
and i thought,  wow
if i could take this in a shot right now
i don't think that we could work this out 
out on the terrace
i don't know if it's fair but i thought  how
could i let you fall by yourself
while i'm wasted with someone else? 

if we go down then we go down together

to get away from your parents
you look so proud
standing there with a frown and a cigarette
posting pictures of yourself on the internet
out on the terrace
we breathe in the air of this small town
on our own, cuttin' class for the thrill of it
getting drunk on the past, we were livin' in

if we go down then we go down together
they'll say you could do anything

strung out in the back of a black car
no keys, all i got is my credit cards
and i've been here a million times
drive fast with the beatles in the background
tell 'em take the 101 out of this town
i was never one to say goodbye

every time i fall in love
i go and fuck it up right when it gets good
don't you think it's funny?
don't you think it's funny?
i know i did all the shitty things to you
i said i never ever would
baby, that's so like me
baby, that's so like me

i don't know why i always run away
i don't know why i always run away
what we had was special
i know what we had was special
i don't know why i always run away
i don't know why i always run away
what we had was special
i know what we had was special

strung out in the back of a black car
i've got a little too good at breaking hearts
i wonder if i'll ever stop

it's been 7 hours and 15 days
since you took your love away
i go out every night and i sleep all day
since you took your love away
since you've been gone, i can do whatever i want
i can see whoever i choose
i can eat my dinner in a fancy restaurant
but nothing, i said nothing can take away these blues
'cause nothing compares, nothing compares to you

it's been so lonely without you here
like a bird without a song, ahh
nothing can stop these tears from falling down
tell me, baby, where did i go wrong?
i could put my arms around every boy i see
they only remind me of you
i went to the doctor, and guess what he told me
guess what he told me
he said, "girl, you better try to have some fun
no matter what you do," but he's a fool
'cause nothing compares, nothing compares to you
nothing compares, nothing compares to you
nothing compares, nothing compares to you


i've been working on myself and on my patience
but sometimes that shit don't come easy
and i see you've been tryin your best to give me explanations
but words don't really cut it lately

remember when our love was precious
we thought what we had was the best, yeah
now every answer's a question
like every night is one of us is getting aggressive
the other one's acting possessive
guess it's the way that we do shit now

you and me we never say we're sorry
hands around my body
fucking 'til we're good
fucking 'til we're good
and we promise we'll do better
both go down together
fucking 'til we're good

if it isn't love, tell me why do we hurt so good?
if it isn't love, tell me why do we hurt so good together?
if it isn't love, tell me why do we feel so good?
if it isn't love, tell me why do we hurt so good together?
so good together

we don't do no  we don't do no conversations
we don't talk the way we used to
you act like we're all good sometimes, you know i hate it
'cause it's so obvious it ain't true

remember when our love was precious
we thought what we had was the best yet

don't trust the ones who love you
'cause if you love them back
they'll always disappoint you
it's just a matter of fact

don't love the ones who trust you
it's just not in your heart
you're a teasing little twister and
they're dancers in the dark, oh, but

i wish i had a lover who'd keep it undercover
we could live our dreams, we'd sail on golden wings
i wish i had a lover, someone who wouldn't bother
to tell me what to feel, to tell me what is real
it's not a lot i'm asking for

they'll kiss you in the evening, devils in disguise, and
love you till the morning then vanish before your eyes
a walking disaster can also master
a graceful posture, but where's the dignity when...?

i wish i had a lover who'd keep it undercover
and we could live our dreams, we'd sail on golden wings
i wish i had a lover, someone who wouldn't bother
to tell me what to feel, to tell me what is real

i wish i had a lover who'd keep it undercover
and we could live our dreams, we'd sail on golden wings
i wish i had a lover, someone who wouldn't bother
to tell me what to feel, to tell me what is real

it wouldn't even matter
if you didn't even bother
to be more than a lover
it wouldn't even matter
if i didn't even bother
to believe in a forever, no
it wouldn't even matter
if you didn't even bother
to be more than a lover, no
it wouldn't even matter
if i didn't even bother
to believe in your forever, no
it wouldn't even matter
if i didn't even bother
to be more than a lover, no, no, oh

do you believe in reincarnation?
'cause i thought i saw your soul
flashing and dancing on the horizon
shades of jade and emerald
oh, i'm a bad girl 'cause i turned the bad world
into a crystal pearl
and we were loveless, oh, it was pure bliss
something i've never felt before
i might be crazy, but baby, lately
i don't believe the news
they say it's ending to stop pretending
to start looking for the clues
a glass cylinder where we can linger
let me take us to the stars
i won't be missing your tender kissing
'cause the light will wipe out all the scars



ah, ah, ah, ah

if it's in your heart it's hard to find
but i can't stop looking since you found me attractive
i can't get past it
if it's in the deep blue of your sky
stay awake 'til morning, you can hold me captive
tell me without asking

and i need you now
cause baby i got nowhere to go
and i need you now
cause baby i got nowhere
cause baby i got nowhere

i watched the flame around your tongue
you spark a fire, forever young
and now i'm burning for it
you got me burning for it
kiss me again with more red wine
i'll stop and stay without goodbye
you got me hurting for it
you got me hurting for it
you got me burning now i'm hurting for it
you got me burning, you got me hurting
kiss me again

and i need you now
cause baby i got nowhere to go
and i need you now
cause baby i got nowhere to go
and i need you now
cause baby i got nowhere


if we knew then what we do now
we'd hold our hands and take a bow
together we would stand our ground
and fight

i remember the night we got drunk
i got sick on the subway
with your hands on my face
said "it don't matter babe
'cause i'm always on your side"

life isn't pretty we all get a little wrecked sometimes
if god's listening, people think you're out of your mind
even if you believe it
through all the hard times
i'm on your side
on your side
i'm on your side
on your side

i still wear your t shirt out
all the ink is faded now
i wonder who you're dreaming of
tonight

i remember the night
when you packed all your bags in the doorway
said, "i don't wanna fight
you can leave, but remember
i'm always on your side"

life isn't pretty we all get a little wrecked sometimes
if god's listening, people think you're out of your mind
even if you believe it
through all the hard times
i'm on your side
on your side
i'm on your side
on your side

on your side
life isn't pretty we all get a little wrecked sometimes
if god's listening, people think you're out of your mind
even if you believe it
through all the hard times
i'm on your side


this isn't goodbye
i just need a little time to hide
we're forever you and i
and you know it
wouldn't give it all away
'cause we weathered that storm and the pouring rain
when i need a little love
you show it

and nothing beats that high
but coming down from you
well it takes just a little time
so i put it in writing

even when it hurts

'cause nothing beats that high
but coming down from you

you writing those rhymes and acts you produce are really kickin', but

when you first left me, i was wanting more
but you were fucking that girl next door, what'cha do that for?
when you first left me, i didn't know what to say
i've never been on my own that way, just sat by myself all day

i was so lost back then
but with a little help from my friends
i found a light in the tunnel at the end
now you're calling me up on the phone
so you can have a little whine and a moan
and it's only because you're feeling alone

at first, when i see you cry
yeah, it makes me smile, yeah, it makes me smile
at worst, i feel bad for a while
but then i just smile, i go ahead and smile

whenever you see me, you say that you want me back
and i tell you it don't mean jack, no, it don't mean jack
i couldn't stop laughing, no, i just couldn't help myself
see, you messed up my mental health, i was quite unwell

i was so lost back then
but with a little help from my friends
i found a light in the tunnel at the end
now you're calling me up on the phone
so you can have a little whine and a moan
and it's only because you're feeling alone

ooohh oh ooooh, oh oh oh ohhh
ooohh oh ooooh, oh oh oh ohhh

it's a cruel, cruel world, to face on your own
a heavy cross, to carry alone
the lights are on, but everyone's gone
and it's cruel

it's a funny way, to make ends meet
when the lights are out on every street
it feels alright, but never complete
without you

i trust you, if it's already been done, undo it
it takes two, it's up to me and you, to prove it
all the rainy nights, even the coldest days
you're moments ago, but seconds away
the principal of nature, it's true but, it's a cruel world
ooooh oooh oohh, ooh ooh oooh ooh, ooo wooah

we can play it safe, or play it cool
follow the leader, or make up all the rules
whatever you want, the choice is yours
so choose

i trust you, if it's already been done, undo it
it takes two, and it's up to me and you, to prove it
ei ei ei ei ei, oh oh oh oh oh, ye oh oh
ei ei ei ei ei, oh oh oh oh oh, ye eh, ye eh, ye eh
i trust you, if it's already been done, undo it
it takes two, it's up to me and you, to prove it
ei ei ei, woah wo, yeah eh
ei ei ei ei ei, oh oh oh oh oh, ye eh, ye eh, ye eh
i trust you, if it's already been done, undo it
it takes two, it's up to me and you, to prove it
ei ei ei ei ei, oh oh oh oh oh, ye oh oh
ei ei ei, oh oh oh oh oh, ye eh, ye eh, ye eh
i trust you


if you ever get close to a human
and human behavior
be ready, be ready to get confused
there's definitely, definitely, definitely no logic
to human behavior
but yet so, yet so irresistible

and there is no map

they're terribly, terribly, terribly moody
oh, human behavior
then all of a sudden turn happy
but, oh, to get involved in the exchange
of human emotions
is ever so, ever so satisfying

and there is no map

human behavior, human, human
human behavior, human, human
human behavior
human behavior, human, human

and there is no map
and a compass wouldn't help at all

human behavior, human, human
human behavior, human
human behavior, human, human
human behavior, human, human

there's definitely, definitely, definitely no logic
human behaviour, human
human behaviour, human
human behaviour, human

there's definitely, definitely, definitely no logic
human

it's a good thing tears never show in the pouring rain
as if a good thing ever could make up for all the pain
there'll be no last chance to promise to never mess it up again
just a sweet pain of watching your back as you walk
as i'm watching you walk away

and now you're gone, there's like an echo in my head
and i remember every word you said

it's a cruel thing you'll never know all the ways i tried
it's a hard thing, faking a smile when i feel
like i'm falling apart inside
and now you're gone, there's like an echo in my head
and i remember every word you said

but you never were, and you never will be mine
no, you never were, and you never will be mine

for the first time, there is no mercy in your eyes
and the cold wind's hitting my face and you're gone
and you're walking away  away 
and i am helpless sometimes
wishing's just no good
'cause you don't see me like i wish you would

cause you never were, and you never will be mine
no, you never were, and you never will be mine
there's a moment to seize every time that we meet
but you always keep passing me by
no, you never were, and you never will be mine

i saw you at the station
you had your arm around what's her name
she had on that scarf i gave you
and you got down to tie her laces
you looked happy and that's great
i just miss you, that's all

cause you never were, and you never will be mine
 you looked happy, and that's great 
no, you never were, and you never will be mine

i was only wanting
hour on the phone like
till your reasons start to shift
really think you could give yourself away
half a moments living in the sunset of our youth
kill the world wasn't enough to turn us loose
you never notice when my breathing gets loud
but give yourself a break

another sunlight in your eyes
and now they remind me of
nothing ever made it right

painting it powder blue
like the reflections in your room
we can just take a day
acting around on top of you

time there was a cracked wrist
honouring intentions
dancing in the pouring rain
you don't deserve to miss every chance you get
i discovered that you wouldn't like to give up
it makes me wonder if you'd ever give me trust
i heard you think i'm not the quickest catch
but you know we've got it made

it's just a lover's bid to lose
one o' clock after noon
to follow all the paths you choose

painting it powder blue
like the reflections in your room
we can just take a day
acting around on top of you
counting the time of dream
love's an illusion hard to keep
spinning the dark
to make it all fall back in peace

you tread them through like it's just another day
 i'll take your word for it 
he'll treat the weeks like they're for free
you soften your voice
i know exactly what i'm supposed to do
to look all the boys, i could say anything i wanted to

it's just a lover's bid to lose
one o' clock after noon
to follow all the paths you choose

painting it powder blue
like the reflections in your room
we can just take a day
acting around on top of you
counting the time of dream
love's an illusion hard to keep
spinning the dark
to make it all fall back in peace


i could get you down
fully loaded, fully loaded with my face up in the clouds
i could find a town
trade the city for a place where i can keep the pressure down
got to save some face
tired of pleasing all the players when they wind up in the chase
got to be a place
where our shoulders won't be burning by the burning of the blaze

i've been waiting on the summer
i'll take you there
come with me and get some colour
i'll bleach my hair
if you go and find a lover
everyone shares
i've been waiting on the summer
i'll take you there

go and build your tribe and let them decide
where they willing, what the rules are, just swallow your pride
take a look inside and let them describe
i'm a doctor, it's your weakness, let you seek and you will find
that you will find

i've been waiting on the summer
i'll take you there
come with me and get some colour
i'll bleach my hair
if you go and find a lover
everyone shares
i've been waiting on the summer
i'll take you there

the summer comes so slow
and moves too fast
and when you're young, you don't ever know
how long it lasts
the summer comes so slow
and moves too fast

i've been waiting on the summer
i'll take you there
come with me and get some colour
i'll bleach my hair
if you go and find a lover
everyone shares
i've been waiting on the summer
i'll take you there


if you didn't know that you were right for me
then there's nothing i can say
tried to call you out to spend some time to see
but somebody's in your way
tried to let it go and say i'm over you
i'm not over you
but i'm trying

party for one
if you don't care about me
i'll just dance for myself
back on my beat
i'll be the one
if you don't care about me
making love to myself
back on my beat

you don't want my love
if you don't care about me
i'll just dance for myself
back on my beat
party for one
if you don't care about me
making love to myself
back on my beat
ahh, ahh, ahh

once upon a time, i thought you wanted me
was there no one else to kiss?  no one else to kiss 
was it all a dream i let myself believe?
i'm not over this  i'm not over this 
but i'm trying

party for one  hey 
if you don't care about me
i'll just dance for myself
back on my beat
i'll be the one
if you don't care about me
 you don't care that i'm 
making love to myself
back on my beat

you don't want my love
if you don't care about me
i'll just dance for myself
back on my beat  back on my beat

 verse 
i said i didn t need you
i said your love it wasn t worth it
and i would leave you
you always said i wasn t good enough
and i believed you
sorry's to painful now
it s too late for us
sorry's to...
 chorus 
but i still believe in magic
i still believe in love
i still believe that every day's another day
to find someone
with magic
and with love
i m gonna wait and find someone
with magic
and with love
i m gonna wait and find someone
 verse 
so what becomes of this
is this the end of us
is this the end of love
i guess it s all that i got for now
memories stacked on memories
of this and us and this and love
an all i had was this
thought that i'd die with this
 bridge 
don't don't
i guess you ll live without my love
i know you always had a thousand lives to live
i guess you ll choose another life
i bet you ll fall in love and find the perfect wife, tomorrow
while i ve been loving you
i've been loving you
 chorus 
and he'll be better than you
and when he says he loves me i'll know that its true
you said "i probably should have told you along time ago
i didn't have a heart to love but, i didn't know.  but you should still believe in magic"
 chorus 


here, in a familiar place
we got our heads down
and we pretend it's 'cause the night is dark
and running out of space for us to run around
but it's a dead end and money's tight

and it's been a long time of this
something has got to give

everyone here is ready to go
it's been a hard year with nothing to show
from down this road
it's only on we go, on we go
everyone here is ready to go
it's been a hard year and i only know
from down this low
it's only up we go, up we go

let's get on another flight
maybe set out to sea
pick it up and shake our fist at it
'cause death is harder to come by than it is to breathe
when you got to make or break for it

'cause it's been a long time of this
something has got to give

everyone here is ready to go
it's been a hard year with nothing to show
from down this road
it's only on we go, on we go
everyone here is ready to go
it's been a hard year and i only know
from down this low
it's only up we go, up we go

nothing gives easy, easy gives nothing
i'm just trying to keep income coming in
dawn is bound to break when the night is done
always darker days before brighter ones

everyone here is ready to go
it's been a hard year with nothing to show
from down this road
it's only on we go, on we go
everyone here is ready to go
it's been a hard year and i only know
from down this low
it's only up we go, up we go


i envy the birds high up in the trees
they live out their lives so purposefully
i envy the spiders, the squirrels and seeds
they all find their way automatically

but in this handmade heaven, i come alive
bluebirds forever colour the sky
in this handmade heaven, we forget the time
'cause birds of a feather fly together

i carry along a feel of unease
i want to belong like the birds in the trees
i sit on my own, look over the town
the skyscrapers glow like they'll never fall down

but in this handmade heaven, it's paradise
bluebirds forever colour the sky
in this handmade heaven, we forget the time
'cause birds of a feather fly together
in this handmade heaven, i come alive
bluebirds forever colour the sky
in this handmade heaven, handmade heaven
handmade heaven, handmade heaven

and i could no longer ignore
the ivy growing tall
this life don't suit me anymore
the writing's on the wall

in this handmade heaven, i come alive
bluebirds forever colour the sky
in this handmade heaven, handmade heaven
handmade heaven, handmade heaven

 bluebirds forever  birds of a feather
 bluebirds forever  fly together
 bluebirds forever  in this strange, strange weather
 bluebirds forever  in this handmade heaven
in this handmade heaven, in this handmade heaven
in this handmade heaven, in this handmade heaven

i'm so tired of moving on
spending every weekend so far gone
heat wave, nothing to do
woke up in my clothes having dreamt of you

swirl in the white evening sun
tell me that i'm the only one
and i hope i never get a clue
green eyes, i don't know what to do

and i hope whoever it is
holds their breath around you
'cause i know i did
and otherwise
if only sometimes
would you give it up, green eyes?

passing phases wear you thin
same old world that you've been sleeping in
and i hope it never spends you up
green eyes, what could ever be enough?

and i hope the love that you find
swallows you wholly
like you said it might
and otherwise
if only sometimes
would you give it up, green eyes?

i'm feeling low
i'm not into sometimes

mama said when you fly away
like a leaf in the wind
paper rolls from that other place
where the bluebirds sing
on the coast of my fantasy
there's a hope for a change
though the things that are still to be
always seems so strange

i'm, i'm far away from my home
finding my way, looking for stars in the storm, oh
but i found some roses to show you
were growing wild through the floor
i'm, i'm far away, on my way back to your door

mama told me to take the light
from the house on the hills
and let it shine in a foreign night
when the hearts are still
on the clouds of my fantasy
we'll be pushing the storm
so i'll be where i need to be
at the break of dawn

i'm, i'm far away from my home
finding my way, looking for stars in the storm, oh
but i found some roses to show you
were growing wild through the floor
i'm, i'm far away on my way back to your door

i'm, i'm far away, on my way back to your door


clocks strikes upon the hour
and the sun begins to fade
still enough time to figure out
how to chase my blues away
i've done alright up 'til now
it's the light of day that shows me how
and when the night falls loneliness calls

oh  wanna dance with somebody
i wanna feel the heat with somebody
yeah  wanna dance with somebody
with somebody who loves me

i've been in love and lost my senses
spinning through the town
soon or later the fever ends
and i wind up feeling down
i need a man who'll take a chance
on a love that burns hot enough to last
and when the night falls
my lonely heart calls

oh  wanna dance with somebody
i wanna feel the heat with somebody
yeah  wanna dance with somebody
with somebody who loves me
oh  wanna dance with somebody
i wanna feel the heat with somebody
yeah  wanna dance with somebody
with somebody who loves me
don't you wanna dance? with me baby?
don't you wanna dance? with me boy?
don't you wanna dance? with me baby?
with somebody who loves me

oh  wanna dance with somebody
i wanna feel the heat with somebody
yeah  wanna dance with somebody
with somebody who loves me
oh  wanna dance with somebody
i wanna feel the heat with somebody
yeah  wanna dance with somebody
with somebody who loves me
oh  wanna dance with somebody
i wanna feel the heat
yeah  wanna dance with somebody
with somebody who loves me

you say i'd best be going cause it's getting late
and i say
why don't i walk you home cause it's on the way
but the last time
that we made love, you left in tears
so this time
you're wondering how to leave it here
and i haven't seen you since last winter break
and i know that i broke your heart
but always such a smart one, always so intelligent
you must know that i took it hard

oh, baby i think we both know
this is the love that we won't get right
still if you said that you wanted
i know i'll always have one more try
oh, baby, i think we both know
this is the love that we won't get right
still if you said that you wanted
i know i'll always have one more try

you pull
that face like, 'here we go again'
so i pull
a flask out the back of my jeans
and then you take a pull
and in my mind we're in my bed
and i'm pulling
your sweater up over your head
and i haven't seen you since last winter break
and i know that you hate how that went
but always such a smart one, always so intelligent
you must know what's happening

oh, baby i think we both know
this is the love that we won't get right
still if you said that you wanted
i know i'll always have one more try
oh, baby, i think we both know
this is the love that we won't get right
still if you said that you wanted
i know i'll always have one more try

oh it's magnetic, isn't it?
the sense of something underneath the surface
when you're laying on thin ice
just a little bit masochistic
a tentative ellipses
the parting of your lips and the ache in your eyes
but i think i'm gonna kiss you

all despite
what we both know
this is the love that we won't get right
still if you said that you wanted
i know i'll always have one more try
oh, baby, i think we both know
this is the love that we won't get right
still if you said that you wanted
i know i'll always have one more try


you said, you said
"turn the lights down, i wanna be alone"
i read your head away
i couldn't stand how it pleaded
i needed to take

take a break, take me down, take me down there
i wanna stare at the tears, how they watered your years
take a break, take me down, take me down there
i wanna stare at your tears, how they

i, i, i lied, now i'm lying awake
i, i, i cried 'til my body ache
i, i, i lied, now i'm lying awake
i, i, i cried 'til my body ache

you sweat, and you bled
i couldn't look cause your body, your body would shake
and you feared a lonely death
like a lake leaves you alone in her depths

take a break, take me down, take me down there
i wanna stare at the tears, how they watered your years
take a break, take me down, take me down there
i wanna stare at your tears, how they

i, i, i lied, now i'm lying awake
i, i, i cried 'til my body ache
i, i, i lied, now i'm lying awake
i, i, i cried 'til my body ache

i wanna know what's your
i wanna know what's your quietest feeling
i saw you break out, i saw you break out
saw you unreeling
i lied, now i'm lying awake
i cried until my body ache
i lie, now i'm lying awake
now i'm lying awake, now i'm lying awake

i, i, i lied, now i'm lying awake
i, i, i cried 'til my body ache
i, i, i lied, now i'm lying awake
i, i, i cried 'til my body ache

now i'm lying awake, now i'm lying awake
until my body ache, until my body ache
i, i, i cried 'til my body...
body ache
body

ooohh oh ooooh, oh oh oh ohhh
ooohh oh ooooh, oh oh oh ohhh

it's a cruel, cruel world, to face on your own
a heavy cross, to carry alone
the lights are on, but everyone's gone
and it's cruel

it's a funny way, to make ends meet
when the lights are out on every street
it feels alright, but never complete
without you

i trust you, if it's already been done, undo it
it takes two, it's up to me and you, to prove it
all the rainy nights, even the coldest days
you're moments ago, but seconds away
the principal of nature, it's true but, it's a cruel world
ooooh oooh oohh, ooh ooh oooh ooh, ooo wooah

we can play it safe, or play it cool
follow the leader, or make up all the rules
whatever you want, the choice is yours
so choose

i trust you, if it's already been done, undo it
it takes two, and it's up to me and you, to prove it
ei ei ei ei ei, oh oh oh oh oh, ye oh oh
ei ei ei ei ei, oh oh oh oh oh, ye eh, ye eh, ye eh
i trust you, if it's already been done, undo it
it takes two, it's up to me and you, to prove it
ei ei ei, woah wo, yeah eh
ei ei ei ei ei, oh oh oh oh oh, ye eh, ye eh, ye eh
i trust you, if it's already been done, undo it
it takes two, it's up to me and you, to prove it
ei ei ei ei ei, oh oh oh oh oh, ye oh oh
ei ei ei, oh oh oh oh oh, ye eh, ye eh, ye eh
i trust you


i walked across an empty land
i knew the pathway like the back of my hand
i felt the earth beneath my feet
sat by the river and it made me complete

oh simple thing, where have you gone?
i'm getting tired and i need someone to rely on

i came across a fallen tree
i felt the branches of it looking at me
is this the place we used to love?
is this the place that i've been dreaming of?

oh simple thing, where have you gone?
i'm getting old and i need something to rely on

and if you have a minute why don't we go
talk about it somewhere only we know?
this could be the end of everything
so why don't we go
somewhere only we know
somewhere only we know

oh simple thing, where have you gone?
i'm getting old and i need someone to rely on
so tell me when you're gonna let me in
i'm getting tired and i need somewhere to begin

so if you have a minute why don't we go
talk about it somewhere only we know?
this could be the end of everything
so why don't we go
somewhere only we know
somewhere only we know


i found myself dreaming in silver and gold
like a scene from a movie that every broken heart knows
we were walking on moonlight, and you pulled me close
split second and you disappeared and then i was all alone
i woke up in tears, with you by my side
a breath of relief, and i realized
no, we're not promised tomorrow

so i'm gonna love you like i'm gonna lose you
i'm gonna hold you, like i'm saying goodbye
wherever we're standing, i won't take you for granted
cause we'll never know when
when we'll run out of time
so i'm gonna love you, like i'm gonna lose you
i'm gonna love you, like i'm gonna lose you

in the blink of an eye, just a whisper of smoke
you could lose everything, the truth is you never know
so i'll kiss you longer babe  hey  any chance that i get
i'll make the most of the minutes and love with no regret
so let's take our time to say what we want
use what we got before it's all gone
no, we're not promised tomorrow

so i'm gonna love you like i'm gonna lose you
i'm gonna hold you, like i'm saying goodbye

and just when we discover that we need each other
here our lives keep pulling us away
now we're both so unstable at the kitchen table
with these peanut bagels in a foreign state

because the point is that i see it's not just me
the point is that you feel my company
i don't wanna say goodbye
guess i'll see you when the screen is vibrating

it's not just me
i know you're feeling the same way
and i can't fail to believe
when you're feeling the same way
it's not just me
i know you're feeling the same way
and i can't fail to believe
when you're feeling the same way
it's not just me

back then, i'd just decided i was so misguided
that you'd all forget about me, in time
bet you remember it was new year's eve
sparklers through palaced streets
we knew though years do change
we'd always feel the same

because the point is that i see it's not just me
the point is that you feel my company
you know i'll never be too far if you're looking for somebody
i'm here

it's not just me
i know you're feeling the same way
and i can't fail to believe
when you're feeling the same way
it's not just me
i know you're feeling the same way
and i can't fail to believe
when you're feeling the same way
it's not just me

it seems so hard you ll start to feel so
good to know sweeping it under the carpet
it seems so hard you'll start to feel so
good to know sweeping it under the carpet
and i know when you know

it's not just me
i know you're feeling the same way
and i can't fail to believe
when you're feeling the same way
it's not just me
i know you're feeling the same way
and i can't fail to believe
when you're feeling the same way
it's not just me


i wanna fuck you slow with the lights on  lights on, lights on, lights on 
you're the only one i've got my sights on  sights on, sights on, sights on 
type of sex you could never put a price on  price on, price on, price on 
i'll take it off, you're the one i'll roll the dice on  dice on, dice on, dice on 
and i just want a baby with the right one
 i just want a baby with the right  
'cause i could never be the one to hide one
 i could never be the one to hide  

and we lost a lot of things in the fire

it's late and i am tired
wish i could spark a smile
the place is flying high, but right now i want to be low
don't want to move an inch
let alone a million miles
and i don't want to go, but i know i gotta go
i just want to feel alive

the times you don't want to wake up
'cause in your sleep, it's never over when you give up
the sun is always gonna rise up
you need to get up
gotta keep your head up
look at the people all around you
the way you feel is something everybody goes through
dark out
but you still gotta light up
you need to wake up
gotta keep your face up

seems like the more you grow
the more time you spend alone
before you know it you end up perfectly on your own
the city's shining bright, but you don't see the light
how come you concentrate on things
that don't make you feel right?
i just want to feel alright

the times you don't want to wake up
'cause in your sleep, it's never over when you give up
the sun is always gonna rise up
you need to get up
gotta keep your head up
look at the people all around you
the way you feel is something everybody goes through
dark out
but you still gotta light up
you need to wake up
gotta keep your face up

i'm looking for more than a little bit
i'm gonna have to find my way through it
gonna leave a mark, i'm gonna set a spark
i'm coming up off the ground
i won't be looking down

the times you don't want to wake up
'cause in your sleep, it's never over when you give up
the sun is always gonna rise up
you need to get up
gotta keep your head up
look at the people all around you
the way you feel is something everybody goes through
dark out
but you still gotta light up
you need to wake up
gotta keep your face up


riding through the city on my bike all day
'cause the filth took away my licence
it doesn't get me down and i feel okay
'cause the sights that i'm seeing are priceless

everything seems to look as it should
but i wonder what goes on behind doors
a fella looking dapper, and he's sitting with a slapper
then i see it's a pimp and his crack whore

you might laugh, you might frown
walkin' round london town

sun is in the sky, oh why, oh why
would i wanna be anywhere else?
sun is in the sky, oh why, oh why
would i wanna be anywhere else?
when you look with your eyes
everything seems nice
but if you look twice
you can see it's all lies

there was a little old lady who was walking down the road
she was struggling with bags from tesco
there were people from the city having lunch in the park
i believe that it's called al fresco

when a kid came along to offer a hand
but before she had time to accept it
hits her over the head, doesn't care if she's dead
'cause he's got all her jewelry and wallet

you might laugh, you might frown
walkin' round london town

sun is in the sky, oh why, oh why
would i wanna be anywhere else?
sun is in the sky, oh why, oh why
would i wanna be anywhere else?
when you look with your eyes

sun is in the sky, oh why, oh why
would i wanna be anywhere else?

somehow we've always been together
but never got together
i never felt the pressure 'til now
there's something in the air
i'm here and you're just there
i can't pretend that i don't care

yeah, one day i might get it right

one risk from lying on your shoulder
when i was feeling colder
and now i can't get over
one kiss, a dangerous situation
i'm lost in hesitation
my heart's a little shaken

yeah, one day i might get it right
am i ready for tonight?
yeah, caution, caution, amber lights
still can't get you off my mind

don't know how, i don't know where

we don't really talk too often
 cause i don't wanna tell you i believe
you're just another ghost i m stalking
my story's in the winded whispered
things i'd rather see

i want this time to mean something to me
i have to feel my blood start boiling
if all we do is grow apart, then
can we ever get back to the seed?

we don't know love 'til it's taken from us
we don't know love
we don't know love

resurrect the story i was told
of when we were awake, alone and cold
up against the only truth we know
with every question was just another myth to tell our own

and i want this time to mean something to me
i have to feel my blood start boiling
if all we do is grow apart, then
can we ever get back to the seed?

we don t know love  til it's taken from us
we don t know love
we don't know love 'til it's taken from us
we don t know love

we don't, we don't, we don't
we don't, we don't know love
we don't, we don't, we don't

we don't know love 'til it's taken from us
we don't know love
we don't know love 'til it's taken from us
we don't know love

true, it's dance, we know the moves
the bow, the dip, the woo
though the words are true
the state is old news
wrap me in your arms
i can t feel it but
rock me in your arms
i can't feel it but
get up, get down
get up, get down
feel the turn of rotation and stop
see the next one waiting
get up, get down
get up, get down
get up
sentiment's the same but the pair of feet change
i know my words will dry upon the skin
just like a name i remember hearing
wild winters, warm coffee
mom s gone, do you love me?
blazing summer, cold coffee
baby's gone, do you love me?
wrap me in your arms
i can't feel it but
rock me in your arms
i can't feel it but
get up, get down
get up, get down
feel the turn of rotation and stop
see the next one waiting
get up, get down
get up, get down
get up
sentiment's the same but the pair of feet change
get up, get down
get up, get down
feel the general attention
and stop, see the mix won't work
get up, get down
get up, get down
get up
sentiment's the same but the pair of feet change
my baby does the hanky panky, baby
my baby does
 rock me 
my baby does the hanky panky, baby
 in your arms 
my baby does
get up, get down
get up, get down
feel the general attention
and stop, see the mix won't work
get up, get down
get up, get down
get up
sentiment s the same but the pair of feet change


i dream of you
moment i can feel you there
i can hold you
but sometimes there's a shift in the motion
i can't keep you near, just an illusion

can i count on you?
can i count on you?
you're my only virtue

inner demons
that i can't seem to push aside
i can't stop it
and that's why i need you here
i am no good, could you steer me clear of my delusions?

can i count on you
to be there with me now?
i can't bare the thought
of losing you somehow
please hold down the fort
since i am not around
can i count on you
to be there with me?
you're my only virtue

now i may not deserve you
but i can not do without you
didn't know what i had lost
you are my elevation
you're the closest thing to heaven
if i ain't got you
then where am i meant to fall?
moments i can feel you
hold you in my arms
fills this void that i'd found

can i count on you
to be there with me now?
i can't bare the thought
of losing you somehow
please hold down the fort
since i am not around
can i count on you
to be there with me?
you're my only virtue

can i count on you?
can i, can i, can i count on you?
you're my only virtue
count on you, count on you


i can't help it, i'm a moth to the flame
i can't help it, i'm a moth to the flame
i can't help it, i'm a moth to the flame
i can't help it, i'm a, a
he's that kinda man, mama

i should know better than to take your love letters to heart
when the game's already lost before it starts
but hope hides inside the clich 
like a nod of understanding
from the poet who first felt this way
how can i turn away?

i can't help it, i'm a moth to the flame
i can't help it, i'm a moth to the flame
i can't help it, i'm a moth to the flame
i can't help it, i'm a, a
he's that kinda man, mama

but every little pull at the end of the golden rope
fills my foolish heart with foolish hope
that maybe you might feel the same
as if feeling the same was the name of the game
the name of the game
i shouldn't be playing

i can't help it, i'm a moth to the flame
i can't help it, i'm a moth to the flame
i can't help it, i'm a moth to the flame
i can't help it, i'm a, a
he's that kinda man, mama

close enough, close enough
close enough to you, i can't get

close enough to you, i can't get
i shouldn't be playing
close enough, close enough
close enough to you, i can't get

i can't help it, i'm a moth to the flame
i can't help it, i'm a moth to the flame
i can't help it, i'm a moth to the flame
i can't help it, i'm a, a
he's that kinda man, mama

close enough, close enough
close enough to you, i can't get
close enough, close enough
close enough to you, i can't get
close enough, close enough
close enough to you, i can't get
close enough, close enough
close enough to you, i can't get
he's that kinda man, mama

closing like footsteps without a sound
i may be a fool but this is the truth
it s coming for me, and trust me, it's coming for you

i, i wanted peace in my mind, in my mind
i say now, you, you make it harder to find, to find

i've been working on myself and on my patience

and i see you've been tryin your best to give me explanations
but words don't really cut it lately

hands around my body
fucking 'til we're good
fucking 'til we're good

'cause it's so obvious it ain't true

remember when our love was precious
we thought what we had was the best yet
now every answer's a question
