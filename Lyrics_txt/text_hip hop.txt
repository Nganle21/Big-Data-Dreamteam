

1988 senior year at garvey high
where all the guys were corny but the girls were mad fly
lounging with the tipster, cooling with sha
scoping out the honeys they know who they are
i was the b ball playing, fly rhyme saying
fly girl getting but never was i sweating
'cause when it came to honeys i would go on a stroll
until i met my match her name was flo
yeah, i messed around with the one called flo
all the troopers 'round the way used to call her a ho
but deep down in my heart i knew that flo was good to go
'cause i thought it was me like bell biv devoe
but little did i know that she was playing with my mind
the only thing i learned is good girls are hard to find
i feel like heavy d, i need somebody for me
not someone whose mind is blank and tryna juice me for my banks
swinging with my main man lucky behind my back
what type of crap is that yo, how's about a smack?
word life, i can't front, thought i was all that
but now it seems, i've met my match
i was a stone cold lover, you couldn't tell me jack
settling down with one girl, wasn't trying to hear that
i had tonya, tamika, sharon, karen
tina, stacy, julie, tracy
used to love 'em, leave 'em, skeeze 'em, tease 'em
find 'em, lose 'em   also abuse 'em
my whole attitude was new day, next hon
and believe it or not, they all got done
well here comes flo with the crazy whip appeal
and i'm all true man like alexander o'neal
is this really love, then again how would i know
after all this time trying to be a super ho
she finally played me, but yo i'd find another
'cause i got the crazy game and yo, i'm smooth like butter

ayo, it's like butter, it's like butter baby
it's like butter, it's like butter baby
it's like butter, it's like butter baby
it's like butter, it's like butter baby
it's like butter, it's like butter baby
it's like butter, it's like the butter baby
not no parkay, not no margarine
strictly butter, strictly butter, baby

i remember when girls were goodie two shoes but now they turning freaks
all of a sudden  we love you phife   ease off ho, my name's malik
phife this, phife that, where you going, where you at
these girls don't know me from jack, yet i feel like the mack
you didn't want me then, so yo hon, don't want me now
here, here   take the towel, wipe off your brow
and take the contact out your eye, you're far from looking fly
you get an e for effort, and t for nice try
now tell me what's the reason, for dying your hair
slum village gold still dangling in your ear
you barely have a neck but still sporting a rope
four finger ring just so phifer can scope
you looked in the mirror, didn't know what to do
yesterday your eyes were brown but today they are blue
your whole appearance is a lie and it could never be true
and if you really liked yourself then you would try and be you
if your hair and eyes were real, i wouldn't have dissed ya
but since it was bought, i had to dismiss ya
but if you can't achieve it, then why not try and weave it
if you can't extend it then you might as well suspend it
if you can't braid it, best thing to do is fade it
i asked who did your hair and you tell me, "diane made it"
if you were you and just you, talk to you, maybe
but i can't stand, no bionic lady
trying hard to look fly, but yo, you're looking dumber
if i wanted someone like you i would've swung with jaime sommers
you wanna be treated right, see father mc
or check ralph tresvant, for sensitivity
'cause i am not the one, i got more game than parker brothers
phife dawg is on the mic and i'm smooth like butter


yo, microphone check one, two, what is this?
the five foot assassin with the roughneck business
i float like gravity, never had a cavity
got more rhymes than the winans got family
no need to sweat arsenio to gain some type of fame
no shame in my game cause i'll always be the same
styles upon styles upon styles is what i have
you wanna diss the phifer but you still don't know the half
i sport new balance sneakers to avoid a narrow path
mess around with this you catch a size eight up your ass
i never half step cause i'm not a half stepper
drink a lot of soda so they call me dr. pepper
refuse to compete with bs competition
your name ain't special ed
so won't you seckle with the mission
i never walk the street thinking it's all about me
even though deep in my heart, it really could be
i just try my best to like go all out
some might even say yo shorty black you're buggin' out

zulu nation, brothers last creation
minds get flooded, ejaculation
right on the two inch tape
the abstract poet incognito, runs the cape
not the best not the worst and occasionally i curse
to get my point across, so bust, the floss
as i go in between, the grit and the dirt
listen to the mission listen miss as i do work, umm
as i crack the, monotone
children of the jazz so, get your own
smokin r b cause they try to do me
or the best of the pack but they can't do rap
for it's abstract, original
you can't get your own and that's, pitiful
i know i'd be the man if i cold yanked the plug
on r b, but i can't and that's bugged

buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out

yo when you bug out
you usually have a reason for the action
sometimes you do it just for mere satisfaction
people be hounding, always surrounding
pulsing, just like a migraine pounding
you don't really fret, you stay in your sense
camouflage your feeling, of absolute tense
you soar off to another world, deep in your mind
but people seem to take that, as being unkind
"oh yo he's acting stank," really on a regal?
a man of the fame not a man of the people
believe that if you wanna but i tell you this much
riding on the train with no dough, sucks
once again a case of your feet in my nike's
if a crowd is in my realm i'm saying    mic please
hip hop is living, can't yank the plug
if you do the result, will end up kind of bugged

yo, i am not an invalid although
i used to smoke the weed out
ali shaheed muhammad used to say i had to be out
scheming on the cookies with the crazy booming back buns
pushing on them real hard just so we can have the big fun
when i left for road, see, i was boulevard status
battling a mc was when tip was at his maddest
it was one mc after one mc
what the world could they be wanting see from little old me
do i have the formula to save the world?
or was it just because i used to
swipe the women and all the girls
i'm the type of brother with the crazy extended hand, kid
dissed by all my brothers i was all up what my man did
supposed to be my man
but now i wonder cause you're feeble
i go out with the strongies and i separate the evils
it's your brain against my mind, for those about to boot out
all you nasty critters even though you see i bug out

buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out


woo...grand groove, grand groove
woo...grand groove, grand groove

rough, rough, rugged
tough like a nugget
listen to the abstract poetic, don't snub it
the midnight marauder is the hype beat arranger
don't front on my lyrics or the tool 'cause it's danger
hook you like a junkie, you'll flip like a monkey
to the openness of the rhythm, so proceed because i'm funky
i get down, down like a fly hooker's panties
make you catch a spirit and motivate a fanny
i be the fly poet, rappers, they get jelly
upset when i rock, 'cause yo, they rhymes is smelly
see, i got it going on like a forbes tax return
listening to these lyrics when it's hot will make it burn
baby burn, baby burn, up into the heavens
the skies up above, the one you think of
is the highly regarded, hell of the people
your mic and my mic? come on, yo, no equal  word  
so if ya wanna do it to yourself
that is to mess around with the jazz, then just blame yourself
'cause you made your bed, so now you lay in it
that's your shit on the floor, then go and play in it
i refuse to catch a 'l' in a battle
'cause yo, i got the jazz and i'll whup a rapper's ass
into little next to nuthin'
test me if i'm frontin'
i'll pass with flying colors 'cause yo, i am that brotha that can rock

who got the jazz?  we've got the jazz 
who got the jazz?  we've got the jazz 
who got the jazz?  we've got the jazz 
who got the jazz?  we've got the jazz 
we've got the jazz, we've got the jazz, come on

no need for introductions 'cause you know who i be
 the phife dawg  yep, the one who loves to slaugher mc's
i got style, grace and razamatazz
i'm like my girl patrice rushen, yo, i add pizzazz, now
most people remember phife from the phife like smoothness
but now it's time to hit you with roughneck rudeness
i'm still vexed, fuming, gots to come raw
the first punk that tries to flex, i'll be cracking your jaw
i'll mold you, fold you, roll you up like a spliff
don't ever try for test or else that ass will get whipped
i'm forever poppin' junk, it's like a fat invite
to any mc who wants to flex, yo, we can do this tonight
gel up my posse up on linden and 1 9 2
pull up my brothas from sayers ave., the brooklyn zoo
all my crew up in strong island, so yo, don't sleep
'cause it only takes a beat to watch that ass get beat
brothas wanna play rough, but they can all get some
wanna be hero, but you're a zero, that means you gets none
don't ever try to step to a kid you can't get with
why mess with a brotha that your girl once slept with?
i'm a negro, he's a negro, wanna be a negro too?
but beatin' on a girl, is somethin' that a puss' would do
i love jazz, but that doesn't mean that i'm timid
not really a gangsta rapper but i can swing it for a minute

who got the jazz?  we've got the jazz 
who got the jazz?  we've got the jazz 
who got the jazz?  we've got the jazz 
who got the jazz?  we've got the jazz 
come on

 ad lib 


all we want in this life
is peace, prosperity and a little paper
objects, they seem greater
but i'm sure we overcome when we illin' on a drum

we in a world that places heavy emphasis on money synthesis
y'all can be my witnesses
that a fella fascination with money has grown
to the point that he will shit on his own
we got to have it y'all, its not a spike lee cinematic
a piece of paper making niggas get dramatic
but the money doesn't come automatic
gotta motivate ourselves to go and grab it
we got to get it y'all, in an orderly fashion
some cats go about it with too much passion
we got to mediate our greedy levels
'cause the lust of currency can have us sleepin with the devil
gotta recognize it, realize the power
that this little ma huckin piece of paper will devour
man can be greater than the thing he creates
see, i'mma do my thing and see how much i can scrape
yo, i'd rather have respect than money, no doubt
but listen to me y'all, i want the mass amount
that the sesame street dracula can't count
so that i can give my people when that thing surmounts
to higher levels.. of being.. so when i'm mc ing
i hope to see you there steady g ing  say word 
but the only way we can truly reach that goal
is finding true inner peace and prospering souls
it's like that


here comes your royal highness, one of queens finest
believe me, honest, you know you can't stop it
come on son, never leave your mic 'round me
true mc for real, ask my man shaheed
strictly focused on what i'm in this rap game for
not for fame and screwing every whore after whore
with all that aids stuff going round
tell me how that sound
rather hit the studio and hear some beats that pound
now, don't get me wrong, i love honeys galore
but see hip hop's my bread and butter
'cause that's what i get paid for
see this is what i wanted, allah helped me to get it
and if the beat is wicked, you know malik will rip it
from the bottom of my heart, that's where the love starts
the love for breakdancing, my love for the art
and with this love i do hip hop from the soul
a real mc, who never sweats how many copies are sold
yeah, i want to go gold, platinum, uh huh, etcetera
but why put out some wackness when no one will respect ya?
i'm staying true, nuff respect to those that paved the way
from bambaataa down to shah; that be my dj
without my peeps i don't know how the hell i'd make it, word
sometimes i feel that my career is headed for the curb
one love for lending hand and giving all your help
believing in me when i didn't believe in my own self
the abstract with whom i'm always making rugged tunes
kid hood resting in heaven, i hope to see you soon
i keep things hot and this year they're even hotter
big mu and shah, one day i'll take my shahada
out


look into my eyes
you will see what you mean to me
search your heart, search your soul
oh, when you find me there you'll search no more

don't tell me it's not worth tryin' for
you can't tell me it's not worth dyin' for
you know it's true, everything i do, i do it for you

look into your heart, you will find
there is nothin' there to hide
take me as i am, take my life
i would give it all, i would sacrifice

don't tell me it's not worth tryin' for
you can't tell me it's not worth dyin' for
you know it's true, everything i do, i do it for you

there is no love, like your love
an' no other could give me more love
there's nowhere, unless your there
all the time, all the way

you can't tell me it's not worth tryin' for
i just can't help it, there's nothin' in the world i want more
oh, i would fight for you
yeah, i'd lie for you
walk the wire for you

my mother went away for a month long trip
her and some friends on an ocean liner ship
she made a big mistake by leaving me home
i had to roam so i picked up the phone
dialed ali up to see what was going down
told him i pick him up so we could drive around
took the dodge dart, a '74
my mother left a yard but i needed one more
shaheed had me covered with a hundred greenbacks
so we left brooklyn and we made big tracks
drove down the belt, got on the conduit
came to a toll, and paid and went through it
had no destination, we was on a quest
ali laid in the back so he can get rest
drove down the road for two days and a half
the sun had just risen on a dusty path
just then a figure had caught my eye
a man with a sombrero who was 4 feet high
i pulled over to ask where we was at
his index finger he tipped up his hat
el segundo, he said, my name is pedro
if you need directions, i'll tell you pronto
need a civilization, some sort of reservation
he said a mile south there's a fast food station
thanks, se or, as i started the motor
ali said "damn, tip, what did you drive so far for?"

well, describe to me what the wallet looks like

anyway a gas station we passed
we got gas and went on to get grub
it was a nice little pub in the middle of nowhere
anywhere would have been better
i ordered enchiladas and i ate em
ali had the fruit punch
when we finished we thought for ways to get back
i had a hunch
ali said: pay for lunch, so i did it
pulled out the wallet and i saw this wicked beautiful lady
she was a waitress there
put the wallet down and stared and stared
to put me back into reality, here's shaheed
"yo tip man, you got what you need?"
i checked for keys and started to step
and what do you know, my wallet i forget

it was a brown wallet, it had props numbers
it had my jimmy hats, i gotta get it man

lord, have mercy
the heat got hotter, ali starts to curse me
i feel bad but he makes me feel badder
chit chit chatter, car starts to scatter
breaking on out, we was northeast bound
jetting on down at the speed of sound
three days coming and three more going
we get back and there was no slack
490 madison, we're here, sha
he said, "all right, tip, see you tomorrow
thinking about the past week, the last week
hands go in my pocket, i can't speak
hopped in the car and torped' to the shack
of shaheed, we gotta go back
when he said "why?," i said "we gotta go
'cause i left my wallet in el segundo"

i left my wallet in el segundo
i left my wallet in el segundo
i left my wallet in el segundo
i got to get it, i got, got to get it
i left my wallet in el segundo
i left my wallet in el segundo
i left my wallet in el segundo

don't be bitter, i hear that honey resembles a critter
heard she likes the two on one like my man john ritter
but back to the subject, you can't catch wreck
you must get respect, to earn respect
suckers think they could hurt me, 'cause now i wear specs
you're full of jokes, but yo, your name ain't flex
i got the riches, the bitches, i'm large like a huxtable
you think you're all that, but your girl's quite doable 
yeah, i'm tellin' you g, to back up off me

i'm the undercover brother, dump your hoe in the trunk
save all the sad songs and the tearjerkers
niggas step back, it's the lyrical worker
the poems that i create ain't in paperback books

if you step to this then the plot just thickens
i'll run you around the track like a bunny and a dog
to me, your just another mc on the log
a link in the chain, fluid on the brain
i boast of hype lyrics, and yours are mundane
see, i can't maintain, especially if you come back
i'm the lyrical master blaster, yeah, i could do that
i could also do your girl, so leave the hoe at home
'cause when i get done, i'll have her strung on bones
it's the no joke pressure, that elevates my mind
make me pick up and go when it's time to drop my rhymes
my title is rock, the abstract poetic
i'm in the idle mode but my energy's kinetic
so smooth and debonair, special for the ear
gotta keep my thing in gear
'cause it's evident and clear that i will rock, rock, rock...

yup yup yup
to the north to the south to the east to the west
i don't discriminate boy i bring it to your chest
if you oppose, then your soul will decompose
strive to get money and i'm not no hoe
fresher than the air that you're breathing through your nose
iller than the kicks that you're puttin on your toes
you can ask bo but yo that nigga don't know
about the dominant factor, the accurate rapper
here's the next chapter, page ninety five
niggas so hard it's a wonder they alive
but yo we still survive through the danger that lurks
my eyes remain wide while you ass like urk
and yo my family matters, so all you mad hatters
put your thinking caps on and motherfuckin brainstorm
'cause i got the plan that wins and can't lose
your man knows who's nice, say tip, he'll say "true"
a lot of these jokers out here is blas 
i'll be rockin mikes until a horse says 'hey'
some are preoccupied with glamour and glitz
actin all bougie and making big movies
but i'll be in the cut, call me incognito
busy making joints that will bump for my people
you're listening to a man who was something from nothing
stay in me forever head, never be frontin'

once in a while we have fun in the mix
into good living but some be into glitz
everybody knew, all the fellas and the chicks
we gotta wear a shoe that fits
c'mon word, check it out now 
uh, uh, check it out now 
what? uh, check it out now 
 uh, check it out, yo

peace to the girl named hurricane g
peace to my girl named dawn paris
peace to the organized kon fus ion
peace to all my shorties who be dying too young
peace to both coasts and the land in between
peace to your man if you're doing your thing
peace to my peoples who is incarcerated
asalaam alaikum means peace, don't debate it
devouring, and towering over fools
your mic is broke and my shit's cool
the black man with the understanding of
the three wise men and the theories of zen
yo, i get inside the crevice like a dentist
disrupt, the block, like dennis, the menace
shaheed is on the needle, the shit it won't weeble
or wobble, your rhymes is mixed up like boggle
bingo  that was the damn dog's name
but yo i know another one with much more fame
the phife dawg, and that's my word to the cipher
about to bring it to your chest and 'cause strife, check it out
you're doubling back to your rhyming pad
what i represent is mc's gone mad
in a perfect world there's imperfect acts
we've come like a guide to redirect alla that
so people with a gift can just flaunt and get money
so much, we in the bank that the shit ain't funny
money is invested in real estate and stocks
but not inside the glamour 'cause all of that stops

yo, this the cons to the quence
up in ya like a stiff one, nah'mean?
it's nine five, you got to live it or rip it
so if you step on the streets keep it movin, nah'mean?


check my style out
life situations are the ones i speak about
it seems cats nowadays be gettin' introduced to courage
don't get discouraged 'cause my words are fluid like flourish
we got the bounty, we from the queens county
overlookin' things like a rushmore mounty
and got no other choice except to get a little love
we rise above, the beat be fittin' like a glove
the pain in my heart is getting dosed by joy
we have no other ploy but to bring the b boy
there's nothing on this earth that can instill fear
the locomotive, puttin' my thing in gear
i only have the fear of god and that's taqwa
you need binaca; your trap is blazing like blanka
i got the lethal, you couldn't put a match to it
let me know, yo, where we could do it like stuart
mind over matter, action is needed
when the big one not to be superseded
responsibility is somethin' i can't deny
the illegalties is the nonsense reply
most cats who scramble do so because they want to
but known to kick rhymes in the past on impromptu
my willy's hot like two links in the skillet
a room filled with speakers, one stage, watch me kill it
knowledge should be sought from the cradle to the grave
rhyming opposition get it twist like super dave
you be looking bug just like uncle jesse
don't make the scene messy
'cause it'll jump, that's word to aunt bessie
profound sentences of pure lyric gems
some of my friends be liking people with stems
folks be on the chase for this cheddar
thinkin' it makes your life better
but it can make you ass out
and when i'm at a show chicks never pass out
we got the joints to make the whole mash out out
a tribe called quest make the party go down
plus we bring positive vibes to fill up all your crowns
lyrics comes to cats like a hot and cold flash
some can come with ease, therefore, it's in a smash
held the fort down like the justice league hall of super friends
but in the world turmoil spins
brothers walk the street with the ill pace face
city life breeds contempt for each race
all praises due to allah and i should say it
it's the abstract motivator making things clear
puttin' things in perspective to rock and roll
'cause you know this kid has got wild soul
americana makes drama like starved out piranha
cold like ice, jet hot like a sauna
it's the haves verse the have not
and guess who's arrived in the hood
exposing all wrongs, it's all good
ayo, word up, hip hop is live like a wire
let's get a little bit before the whole joint expire
i got to stress it again, this here is for my kin
and all my babies, children of the world, no maybe's
so, yo, we gotta move through and push through
because we gotta make it happen, keep it true blue
it's like that
so much confusion goin' on
so much confusion goin' on
inside all mine
inside all mine
so much confusion goin' on
uh, uh, uh, uh
but everything will be fine
so much confusion goin' on
so much confusion goin' on
gotta make it alright
gotta make it alright
gotta elevate your mind
elevate your mind
elevate your mind
elevate your mind
elevate your mind
elevate your mind
elevate your mind


yo.. yeah
nowhere to run to nowhere to hide
sittin' on the front stoop right outside
in the moonlight when i take flight i fly
crank the engine, then i break out like i'm benchin'
thousands of pounds spit thousands of rounds
and verses help 'em out like a found missin' person
this time i'mma try to lounge on the cursin'
so people can hear how my rap sound perfect
could hate a nigga but in fact it's not worth it
never know how long you've got on this earth kid
count them blesses and pay them dues
keep rollin' with the winners cause they don't lose
in the two g era the skies is looking clearer
and nothing can stop them guys that's in the mirror
so thankful that i keep my hands on the bankroll
can't play the shit wreck, falling of the plankroll
so i stay stable like a natural born hustler
kickin' that hot shit right for all the customers
near or far comin' here to star
i'll be pourin' out beer in the park
for my loved ones
deep and thick is how my love runs for you
so with no further ado
i'mma smash it kick that shit they call acid
24 hours a day remain classic
chorus
 in the sun.. sun.. su.. su.. su.. sun
 ah, in the sun kid
 keep going
 in the sun.. sun.. su.. su.. su.. sun
 ah, in the sun kid

 we can't stop it
 in the sun.. sun.. su.. su.. su.. sun
 yeah, in the sun kid

i arise from my melinence to the sun beginning
kiss by the ray of a sunny day
but i feel it in my bone, a child's without a home
a prison cell holds a dream to a black teen
i never thought i'd see the day when brothers pledge allegiance
to a red white and blue that's wavin' untrue
yo, where's the forty acres and the mule, huh?
you rather give us mickey d's and a tool, huh?
and in the sun i see the way you pull our hearts' strings
and in the sun i see your old way to new things
every man has to bow down to god's grace
every soul has to concede to god's goal
politicians get religious to a starved people
as the constitution reads, it says i'm not equal
three fifths of the gifts from a love supreme
this gotta be a bad dream, i'm hearing trains scream
little kids are getting warped from computer thoughts
family structure is destroyed, marriage null and void
all has gotten formulated, really hate to say it
but i can see it easy, really, in the sun
 without lp

yo don't ever think i've forgotten
them days black plottin'
and schemin'
sittin' in the lunchroom
eatin' and dreamin'
on about the things we do
when we reach independence
nothing is brand new
it's all still accordin' to plan
meet your man
from decades ago can't nobody understand
the hardships we've been through
sun to sun
on the wake up knock knock
everybody gotta run for the ultimate goal
can't lose they soul
in the process
so and to you i say god bless
seeing your face lets me see my own
so i zone, and think about the days we got stoned
in the staircase of apartment buildings
little childrens
growing in a world so cold
just like pilgrims, we migrate daily
now a days we rarely get to see one another
but when we connect we still brothers
and now we in the corporate world
and the game is different
you get caught up in the twirl
if your fam ain't affective
so here's our perspective
to help each other
cause man ain't it hectic
 to fade


as we start trudging
me and my brothers we be looking and be bugging
vehicles of life they be rolling and be nudging
searching for the virgins of life
that be shoving out the door that's crack
the valleys of time, are always on my feet
as least the beat will combine
the calluses and corns with the funky bassline
you don't need underdog for a nickel shoeshine or the shoes that's phat
but can i get a level on the bass and on the treble?
footing up and down like a unlv rebel
the answer be amongst us 'cause we rarely dig acoustics
can't be too much flacking, not too much packing
you must container that at least to dip your hand in rap
your feet will be infectious so at least realize the fact
the rhythms are inserted and the nurse can be converted
this ain't rock 'n' roll 'cause the rap is in control
if you're a megastar, words will buy you a car
i'd rather go barefooting, for prints i will be putting
all over the earth if we can get there first
now that we are in it, footprints are being printed
so if you recognize 'em, you can try to size 'em
they'll probably be the ones with the size nine flying
all over the field, you won't have to yield
if you want protection you can hide behind the shield

and the musician often tries to capture the new thing so that we might have melody and have rhythm as we do our thing
it's rough and tough in this ghetto, a lot of funny stuff going down but you got to walk tall. walk tall 

you can game on the gallons if you really need to rock
but we walk while we talk as we stomping through the block
hand in hand 'cross the land as muhammad cross the fade
it's a tribe who meanders, precious like a jade
it's a art, theo arch rhymes the ground placed upon
the mind will unwind, it will soft to beyond
catch the track, track by track, get a map to track a trail
you will find yourself behind for a map does not prevail
see the levels peaking as the rhythms keep a screeching
a quest, oh yes a quest, inside the jam i will keep preaching
the point, oh yes the point, because it's close but yet so far
the liveliness is mean as we scoot across the star
we are bulging, i'm indulging in a rat a tat tat
explanation for the line is that the rhythm is phat
keep it wild, wide and deep, you could dig it in a jeep
but dig it in the ground because the footprint now

walk tall 

if there's a storm that's brewing, it won't keep us from doing
our thing as we start swinging, travelling is bringing
joy inside the domes as we hit the road to rome
a chair is not a chair, a house is not a home
because my skin is brown, yo i'm gonna do the town
rub it in the face and rub my feet all through the place
when you get your finger on the music it'll linger
sing a song o' sixpence, sing it like a singer
a nubian, a nubian, a proud one at that
remember me, the brother who said "black is black"
you can come while we quest, i don't play, i don't jest
get emotions off your chest, we are black, we been blessed
making moves, making motions, flowing like an ocean
the walking will continue, we know that we will bring you
the times that you have waited, more anticipated
be gone but not for long because the feet will stay strong


linden boulevard represent, represent sent
tribe called quest represent, represent sent
when the mic is in my hand, i'm never hesitant
my favorite jam back in the day was "eric b. for presi "

rude boy composer, step to me you're over
brothers wanna flex, you're not mad cobra
mc shorty black, there ain't no other
trini born lad like nia long's grandmother
tip and sha they all that, phife dawg ditto
honey tell your man to chill, or else you'll be a widow
did not you know that my styles are top dollar?
the five foot assassin knocking fleas off his collar
hip hop scholar since being knee high to a duck
the height of muggsy bogues, complexion of a hockey puck
you better ask somebody on how we flip the script
come to a tribe show and watch the three kids rip

queens is in the house represent, represent
a tribe called quest represent, represent
no taming of the style cause it gets irreverent
a tribe called quest represent, represent
huh huh, here we go, you know that i'm the rebel
throwing out the wicked like god did the devil
funky like your grandpa's drawers, don't test me
we in like that, you're dead like presley
when we coming through get tickets to see me
we work for the paper so there'll never be a freebie
lyrics are abundant cause we got it by the mass
egos are all idle cause the music is the task
valenzuela on the pitch, curveball, catch it
i think i got it locked, just smooth while i latch it
right, now i must move with the quickness
here comes shaheed so we must bear the witness

stir it up  stir it up  stir it up 
steve biko
stir it up  stir it up  stir it up 
steve biko

new york city represent, represent
a tribe called quest represent, represent
the dawg is scientific with the styles i invent
a tribe called quest represent, represent
mcs like to meddle, but here's my proposition
i let my lyrics flow, and juxt your whole position
i'm radical with this like the man this song is after
yo tip settle down, what's the reason for the laughter?
i really can't say, i guess i laugh to keep from crying
so much going on, people killing, people dying
but i won't dwell on that, i think i'll elevate my mental
thanks for these bars on the biko instrumental
yo i'll take it back, i'm the indian giver
mcs take notes as i stand and deliver
percussion isn't less, ds wear the vest
why they dodging bullets, you should be dodging quest
don't get me wrong, violence is not our forte
i just like to rhyme, kick the lyric skills like pel 
tip educate 'em, my rhymes are strictly taboo
fill 'em with some fantasies and i'll look out like tattoo

ok, i am recognizing that the voice inside my head
is urging me to be myself but never follow someone else
because opinions are like voices, we all have a different kind
so just clean out all of your ears, these are my views and you will find
that we revolutionize over the kick and the snare
the ghetto vocalist is on a state wide tear
soon to be the continent and then the freaking globe
there's room for it all as we mingle at the mall
we welcome competition cause it doesn't make one lazy or worn
we gotta work hard, you know the damn card
try to be the phattest is the level that we strive
try to be the phattest also to stay alive

each other we got the right seeds done
that ain't enough to plant our dreams in
oh i want some sugar in my bowl
a deeper connection baby

summer '88, started a fight, that can't wait
ask dorothy, same kid pussy up in marcy
blazing that ted rossi up in the marquees
he lost like a hundred ounces, jake rushed his houses
had him on the porch, ass no trousers
this souped up, individual stuck, the new stuff
same kid crying on the stand with judge kuffner
kissed him with odd numbers three to nine style
before he left he flashing his face like denzel
richard dale took his beaver, un threw up all in his whip
mussy dropped and split his wig with the heater

with dirt in his mouth, slim woke him up told him he wild out
blood leaking from his teeth he smiled like he gummed out
big bolo, stacking his shit, financed a volvo

posing like he rapping out...


yo; this goes for all my brothers and sisters locked down
for all my peoples incarcerated, for those who ain't make it

yo, in the housing, thousands seen early graves
victims of worldly ways, memories stays engraved
all my live brothers, is locked down with high numbers
the young hunger, blind to these lies, they die younger
in this new world the order slaughter men, women, and children
ten feet gates surround the building keep us sealed in
the projects, lifeless like a vietnam vet
constant war, sever threats of enemy conquest
crooked cops comb my building complex that's in the rumble
streets are like a jungle, can't let my cypher crumble
vivid thoughts, devils resort to trick knowledge
they kick garbage, lust for chicks and quick dollars
i know the pain the game bring, i did the same thing
spaced out in the staircase, performing a sting
it's hard to keep control, i bless those who seek a scroll
trying to reach a whole nation and break the sleeper hold
not a role model, i walk a hard road to follow
i sold bottles of sorrow then chose poems and novels
the gospel was told, some souls it swallowed whole
mentally they fold, and they eventually sold
their life and times, deadly like the virus design
but too minute to dilute, the scientist mind

you can't party your life away, drink your life away
smoke your life away, fuck your life away
dream your life away, scheme your life away
'cause your seeds grow up the same way

a voice cries from the wilderness of the north
a representation of the families that lost one
all victims of incarceration
or other divisions of the family structure
youths are injected with serums that leads
to skin irritations, babies being born with
disfigurations, experimentations
on their faces there bear worry ations
of mothers that carry the pain
of blood stained streets where sisters mourn and wail
fifth brothers been slain from hails of gun fire
it lightly begins to rain screams of terror
are hidden by the passing trains
this can't be little hussein, his uncle cries
as he drops to his nephew's side, holding his cane
just give me a name, of who has inflicted this
bitter sickness, and left us to witness

yeah, yo; curses from war, innocent blood spills for days
soothe in godly ways, hands, solemn in praise
tree of life, more precious than rubies, golden game
the wise shall flourish inherit, halls of fame
crime visions in my blood got me, locked in prison
while we die hard living people whine about religion, vision
blow, spin, and sin and killing what's revealing
it's a never ending battle with no ending or beginning, listen
zero process, progress, become the hunted
america's most wanted, good life flaunted, want it
some love the speed, some satisfy a need
some want to be down, young gun seed, jungle breed
the strong must feed, someone die, someone bleed
one flew astray, and it caught my little seed
can it be, the ice savage, trife life, made me grab the knife
the righteous man was beat with many stripes, pipes
take in my energy, breath and know the rest
'cause the good die young and the hard die best

you can't party your life away, drink your life away
smoke your life away, fuck your life away
dream your life away, scheme your life away
'cause your seeds grow up the same way
'cause your seeds grow up the same way
'cause your seeds grow up the same way

y'all bitches love dances, and pulling down your pants
while your man's on tour, your spending up his advances
your friends ain't shit, all they do is drink, smoke, and suck dick
the whole projects is trapped in six
you either high school drop outs, one to three cop outs
fifteen years old, shorty ass and top out
ninety nine cent beer drinking pussy stinking
fucking so much your ass and titties start shrinking
new world order slave trade, minimum wage, medicaid
can a devil fool a muslim nowadays
inside my lab, i'm going mad
took two drags off the blunts, and started breaking down the flag
the blue is for the crips, the red is for the bloods
the white's for the cops, and the stars come from the clubs
or the slugs that ignites through the night, by the dawn
early light, why is sons fighting for the stripe

as we dwell through this concrete hell, calling it home
mama say, take your time young man and build your own
don't wind up like your old dad
still searching for them glory days he never had
so many bad want to scheme for american dream, no more kings
the cash rule everything now, we going down
these babies looking up to us, it's up to us
the million man march mc's, get on the bus
but envy, greed, lust, and hate, separate
though the devil mind state blood kin cannot relate
no longer, brothers, we unstable
like kane when he slew abel, killing each other

you can't party your life away, drink your life away
smoke your life away, fuck your life away
dream your life away, scheme your life away
'cause your seeds grow up the same way
'cause your seeds grow up the same way
'cause your seeds grow up the same way


feelings. the emotional side of a man, woman or a child's character. a response or tendency to respond. a belief, which can be vague, illogical, but mostly, irrational

i never gave a fuck on how the next nigga felt
i rocked a heavyweight belt cause that's the way i felt
still feel, so inspired to write a rhyme that's ultimately
no other emcee could get with me, is way i felt

you never know, how when i first came out, how my brothers felt
i've been going through it, plus a lot of deep pain was felt
we would last for a night, but a better tomorrow

i felt the angel of death breathe
when i felt the four fifths something told me squeeze
i felt like it was the end of a dynasty
like i was fighting a clique of five chinese thieves
karate slippers with slip on's so i kept slippin'
the floor was too smooth felt like i couldn't catch a grip in
felt like dragonfly jones, was dragonfly tone
so i kept spitting, woke up when i heard the phone

i never gave a what on how the next rapper felt
i take that rapper's belt myself, i feel how cappa felt
i don't really need help, use a sharpie, don't need the felt
marker, walk on water, i see how jesus felt
no rhyme or reason, just bleeding, my every breathing's felt
this about a thesis that even paraplegics felt
these boys ain't needing, they barely breathing, believe it, seen it
till you got cheated, you couldn't tell me how cheating felt
i'm not a failure, i couldn't tell ya how losing felt
might not have nailed her, but i can tell ya how spooning felt
remember when you first heard the rap and the way it felt
i burned the track with a murder rap and i know it's felt

dust rocks and ice in a particular pattern
then this fascinating picture has emerged from surface
a wonder of the young world with an urgent purpose
a wild fire engulfing every home
it's history chiseled and carved in every stone
a workshop where skills are learned
handcrafted and drafted, written works the main concern
urban center provided with a social structure
and a curious culture full of superconductors
each stain is part of a scene with
intricate geometric raps on a larger screen
spell bounding, marvelous and it's surrounding
viewpoints remain the same, it's all astounding
a place where the forgotten art is so powerful
a striking image is something that's so valuable

nitt da gritt, rgf productions
squad


well excuse me, take a few minutes, to mellow out
big daddy kane is on the mic and i'mma tell about
a minimum length, of rhymes of strength
and power, so listen to the man of the hour
flow and go to a slow tempo and you know
sing ho, swing low, then yo the show
will go on, as i perform
transformin on stage like a decepticon
but i'm not animated like a cartoon
i'm for real, shootin lyrics like a harpoon
across the crowd, the listeners, the spectators
so let's groove with the smooth operator

"cause i'm so smooth..."
the b i g, d a double d y k a n e
i'm good and plenty, servin many and any
competition, wishin' for an expedition
i'm straight up dissin' and dismissin', listen
rappers act so wild, and love to profile
frontin hard but ain't got no style
i give nightmares to those who compete
freddy kreuger, walkin' on kane street
confuse and lose abuse and bruise the crews
who choose to use my name wrong, they pay dues
destruction from the exterminator
but in a calm manner, cause i'm a smooth operator

"cause i'm so smooth..."

now girls step up to this
one simple kiss, and it's over, miss
sold to nice dreamers, high as the price seem
girlfriend, you been scooped like ice cream
so just swing or fling a gathering, try to cling
cause it's a big daddy thing
and i'm lovin em right, word is bond
so just play marvin gaye and let's get it on
i make it real good like dr. feelgood
to make sure that my point is understood
that when it comes to this there's none greater
sincerely yours... the smooth operator

"cause i'm so smooth..."

now ain't that the pot callin' the kettle black
sayin' i'm a new jack, you need to be smacked
the smooth way i say 'em and the way i display 'em
to make them sound different in a way that's gifted
and hey i'm, makin sure every lyric is done fine
and i make one line, bright as the sunshine
attack you like robitussin on a cough
if you know like i know    step off
competition, i'mma get rid of
you can't get a bit of, so just consider
a break or rest, vacation, hibernation
and make way for my smooth operation
i'm a smooth operator

"cause i'm so smooth..."
ahhhhh yeahhh, and you don't stop
genuine for '89
and i still ain't half steppin, peace 


cold gettin' dumb   yeah 
aight, here we go once again
back, for more, with the one, sir vicious just ice
my man mantronix providin' the funky sound for your listenin' pleasure
to rock it on to the break of dawn
on and down to the a.m
with my man dmx, the original human beatbox
yo change the bass
keep it on like this to the break of dawn
show you how a real mc cold rocks the mic and gets things right

it's like that, never the wack, in actual fact
it's like this dominant black, come right and exact
so nice very precise yes, just ice
like this never no tricks you see it's justice
to the best of my knowledge i guess that i'm fresh
and when i manifest i never protest
so you say you never melt, you're supposed to be an adult
sympathetic emotions i never felt so get help
you know that you are lost
and you know that if you're meltin', that you are soft
just ice, sir vicious, is here to rock on
tell you all about myself, let my knowledge be born
respect on the mic when it comes to a rhyme
if you think we're much alike you know you're out of your mind
as i reminisce your chance ended
to try to convince me to believe your stupid nonsense
i'm twice as nice, a gripping vice, precise just ice
rockin' parties nine years of my life
it's a new conceptual, highly intellectual
for me, only 'cause it is genetical
'cause now, 'bout to get loose, got gallons of juice
to pour, and more if you want to choose
negotiable and sociable is done
but let's build and we'll all have fun so don't run
'cause if you leave you will be fooling yourself
you better go and seek some better help
it's time to stop bein' stubborn, and so defiant
just hear my words, acknowledge my science
but if you're crying like the rain, i know it's the pain
obtain some math, and move your brain
to a new potential, identical, the main principle
the science i speak well everything is just rational
the most pressin', i'm giving you a lesson
i test the rest they gets depressed
they didn't appreciate the agony, of defeat
it's the way that i did it, that made it sweet
'cause the people all around agree
my rap is intellect with high velocity
i'm speakin' about me, a delicate wish
sir vicious so smooth like a rimless swish
come with me young ladies it's not too hard
wanna make you my baby and complete the job
like a psychopathological syndrome
my beneficial words are gonna be known
theoretical dilemma facts hard to pen
just ice sir vicious done rocked it again

 mantronix cold getting ill 
 rock the beats 

peace, to all, that, could come
the time is now the deed must be done
cos i rock, and also will devastate
your thoughts then start to manipulate
the bass beats as i start to capture
every beat in sequence, including the scratch
turn off that music and go acapella
match the sound to my voice, then you'll start to treasure
my intelligent, eloquent way of rap
poetic philosophy, yes down pat
inevitable rights, to party all night
double counter second amateur twice
a prototype to endure, my wrath, is much to contain
alleviate the latter, and crush the remain
opportunist victim in a state of shock
you caught a bad decision and now you are stopped
by the one that's called, most vicious of them all
cos even if i sit, i still stand tall
on the most incredible, elevated pedestal
that's hard to beget, but never forgettable
rap connoisseur, who only gives more
and i am sure my rhymes never bore anyone
who listen 'cause i got your attention
diabolical scheme, now here's my invention
a poem, a rap, a haiku in fact
when my opponent hears this ???
a bunch of rhymes, you're just a beginner
with two thousand left i'm bound to be a winner
it's like that on the comeback in actual fact
like this, sweet as a kiss, as y'all reminisce
it's like this never the wack in actual fact
stand back or you might get slapped, jack

ah yeah
 all you sucker niggas get off my dick  
that's the way it's really done when you cold rock the party with an mc like precise just ice
 peace 
and my man mantronik on the wheels of steel, peace

reunited, double lp, world excited
struck a match to the underground, industry ignited
from metaphorical parables to fertilize the earth
wicked niggas come, try to burglarize the turf
scatting off soft ass beats them niggas rap happily
tragically, that style deteriorate rapidly
uncompleted missions, throwing your best known compositions
you couldn't add it up if you mastered addition
where i come from, getting visuals is habitual
you're more safe walking on hot coals in rituals
i splash the paint on the wall, formed a mural
he took a look, saw the manifestation of it was plural
rhyming while impaired, dart hit your garment
pierced your internal streamlined compartments
just consider the unparalleled advantage
of a natural disaster that's impossible to manage

bitchass niggas counterfeit the funk
i smoke the bead of the skunk, tree top of the trunk
moonshine drunken monk, your head get shrunk
your treasure sunk, i be fucking bitches by the chunk
my name black, you worms wanna play in my dirt
bitch stop, my momma serve free lunch from the church
i cum like a thousand doves
bitch you quiet at the bus, making no fuss, i got self love
unglove the noose, watch a nigga transfuse
dirty add to the fuse, heavy at the booze
i don't walk, i get carried
gold and platinum frisbees on my wall, looking properly
but comely, i u.f.o. you wright brothers
the indian that sold manhattan to the white man
my grandfather, step up and get knocked right the fuck out
come to the cook out, dirty bitch at the mouth

wu tang incorp. take your brain on spacewarp
talk strange like bj rk, great hero jim thorpe
how can i put it, life is like video footage
hard to edit, directors, that never understood it
too impulsive, my deadly corrosive dosage
attack when you least notice through explosive postage
i don't play, the rap souffle saut  for the day
ruler zig zag zig a leg leg arm head
spread like plague, we drink hennessy by the keg
i got the golden egg plus the goose
eighty proof absolut mixed with cranberry fruit juice
ginseng boost, i got your neck in a noose
keep my money wrinkled, the rap star twinkle killer instinct
sixteen bar nickel sell more copies than kinko
grow like a fetus with no hands and feet to complete us
and we return like jesus when the whole world need us

is it appetite for destruction?
slap a murder rap on this production
i touch something, trust nothing
iron lung twisted metal
i see 'em ducking my dart gun, busting from every angle
worldwide total carnage, the sickest flow
that be codenamed agent orange, killing you slow
it's only right you pay homage
to those that's 'bout to blow like that shit up your nose
solid as a rock when i strike target
verbal be screaming on you like a drill sergeant
herbals got me where i wanna be right now

yo, too many songs, weak rhymes that's mad long
make it brief son, half short and twice strong
no doubt, it took time searchin, eventually
it was prime urgent, for you to examine the rhyme merchant
lace mc's with styles when they rhyme drunk
on a label hunt, until twenty thou, out the trunk
eight diagram sword swinga armored tank force
rza throw in the disc but then change the bank source
you can't flow, must be the speech impediment
you got lost off the snare off impeach the president
whether in amsterdam smokin seven grams of green
venue packed, a thousand white teens in tight jeans
this witty unpredictable shot is critical
to analytical analogy, insurance policies why
said he know that sounds define the note
couldn't recognize, blast him the fuck behind the ropes
too many dope niggas i see starvin
catch a single deal, a possible plea bargain
wu slay regardless to whom or what, five mics five nights
hang him from the balcony, drop twenty five flights
a fugitive bass playin rap czar
smoke the cigars, his prints on the strings of his guitar

as high as wu tang get
allah allow us pop this shit
just like black shoe fit
if you can't wear it, well don't fuck with it

the ways these rhymes keep comin, at cha splash ya
get your head piece fractured, with killer cuts
from the shropshire slasher, rip shit up
got this whole thing tang mastered, sho nuff
an mc too good to be touched, john john
bring the phenomenon, i cold crush
mc, inferiorities they froze up, ice cold
as we move on, saga unfold
captivated by a saga that go untold, like goldfinger
caught up in a cliffhanger
yo i n s another code red, danger, break out the vest
now it's tactical warfare, it's all here
come with your shield and hardware, it be on here
don't ever roam, in the naked city
eight million stories none pretty
bomb em wit the witty unpredictable
conditionin' be critical
peace to tang, gettin high on your physical, dis next drink
is a toast to your memory
when i go how many niggas gon' remember me

as high as wu tang get
allah allow us pop this shit
just like black shoe fit
if you can't wear it, well don't fuck with it 


the technique is ill son, watch how i spill one
peace to biggie, 2pac, big l and big pun
havoc on the streets of staten, snitches
house niggas, children watch as they produce the same pattern
somebody raped our women, murdered our babies
hit us with the cracks and guns in the early 80's
for those that murdered me shall stand before god
to fall at the hands of fate, then out comes the rod
bring it back, bring it back, bring it back, bring it back, bring it back

what the fuck is going on, i can't go to sleep
feds jumping out their jeeps, i can't go to sleep
babies with flies on they cheeks, it's hard to go to sleep
ish bowled two 6's twice, i couldn't go to sleep
aiyyo we deep in the stairs, we carry big guns
whippy got hit up with the big shit, bong bong
stop at the cheeba spot, then pass the leak spot
drove past y'all niggas again, you took a cheap shot
not knowing, fucking with me you get your meat chopped
you thought we fell on our face, you need to be stopped
call on the chariots, call on an ambulance
you better smile, my nigga you on candid cam
gangsta broad, these be the laws, walk with big balls
nigga, motherfucking eunuch, i even take which was yours
i'm the nigga that made you, man
when your rap wasn't doing well i'm the nigga that gave you a hand

don't kill your brother, learn to love each other
don't get mad, cause it ain't that bad
look at who you are, you've come too far
it's in your hands, just be a man
get the jelly out your spine
cobwebs out of your mind

i can't go to sleep, i can't shut my eyes
they shot the father at his mom's building seven times
they shot malcolm in the chest, front of his little seeds
jesse watched as they shot king on the balcony
exported marcus garvey cause he tried to spark us
with the knowledge of ourselves and our forefathers
oh jacqueline you heard the rifle shots crackling
her husband's head in her hands, you tried to put it back in
america's watching, blood stained ink blotches
medgar took one to the skull for integrating college
what's the science? somebody? this is trick knowledge
they try to keep us enslaved and still scrape for dollars
walking through park hill, drunk as a fuck
looking around like these devils
i'm ready to break this world down
they got me trapped up in a metal gate
just stressed out with hate
and just give me no time to relax and use my mind to meditate
what should i do, grab a blunt or a brew
grab a .22 and run out there and put this fucking violence in you
i can't go to sleep, i can't shut em, son, i 

don't let the game make you lose your head
you should be calling the shots instead
the power is in your hands
stop all this crying and be a man

yo, pa, i got a lady, i'm 'bout to make her my baby
might even make a baby, the thesis makin' her crazy
she know my style wavy, i'm circlin' her mercedes
father, father was a preacher, i'm almost certain he hates me
but he ain't gotta date me and look, his baby is grown
and she decides on her own who resides on the throne
i'm her king, she my queen, we keep it right in the zone
and she understands the fact that i'm even right when i'm wrong
when she was prayin' in church, i was playin' in dirt
that's 100, i admit that we both was playin' at first
when opposites attract, i ain't always sayin' it works
i'm just sayin' ain't no use in me strayin', that make it worse
it's wu tang, baby, my crew bang
and she's the preacher's daughter, i just call her my boo thang
and we tighter than shoestrings, or 10 grand in rubber bands
man, sometimes i tell your parents just don't understand

no. yo, you mean pastor brown's daughter?
the preacher, the rich slave maker of the poorer?
i used to see her sundays comin' from church
we used to kick it at her window when her pops at work
yo, her parents didn't play
she couldn't even come out to play on a school day
thought she was gonna give me some on april fool's day
 but no, no way  nah,  no, no no, no no, no no way 

the preacher's daughter, she an illegitimate child
she know the word, but she be runnin' in them streets foul
she married to a man, but she's crushin' his brother now
see her in the market place loud and boisterous
with tight spandex on, chokin' her oysters
she a seductress in the form of a goddess
never virtuous or modest, poison the part is
breakin' the vessel, turn brother against brother
man, that's how she molest you
that's why the preacher man prolly a mess too
cause the fruit that she devourin' is evil
never sin around righteous people
black widow, preacher's daughter comin' to eat you

the only girl that could ever please me
was the daughter of a preacher man
the only girl that could ever please me

the only girl that could ever please me
was the daughter of a preacher man

i met her on the bus stop with black eyes
that's why she said she don't fuck with black guys
i cleaned her up, fed her all my wisdom
her father spit the gospel but she never caught the vision
brutal ass whoopins, always facin' these evictions
so she only fuck with thugs that'll wind up in the system
them greasy bastards quick to squeeze a ratchet
never knew the science of virtue, ecclesiastes
like, a time for peace, a time for war
a time to laugh though, she never felt god before
eternal love that'll pop like a kernel, this is grown folk talk
between me and her, it don't concern you

the only girl that could ever please me
was the daughter of a preacher man

so you wanna be a rock superstar?
and live large, a big house, 5 cars, you're in charge
comin' up in the world don't trust no body
gotta look over your shoulder constantly

i remember the days when i was a young kid growin' up
looking in the mirror dreamin' about blowin' up
the rock crowd, make money, chill with the honey's
sign autographs or whatever the people want from me
shit's funny how impossible dreams manifest
and the games that be comin' with it, nevertheless
you got to go for the gusto but you don't know
about the blood, sweat and tears and losing some of your peers
and losing some of yourself to the years past gone by
hopefully it don't manifest for the wrong guy
egomaniac and the brainiac don't know how to act
shit's deep, 48 tracks
studio gangster mack signed the deal, thinks he's gonna make a mil'
but never will 'til he crosses over
still filling your head with fantasies
come with me, show the sacrifice it takes to make the cheese
you wanna be a rock superstar in the biz?
and take shit from people who don't know what it is
i wish it was all fun and games but the price of fame is high
and some can't pay the way
still trapped in what you rappin' about
tell me what happened when you lost clout
the route you took started collapsing
no fans, no fame, no respect, no change, no women
and everybody shits on your name

so you wanna be a rock superstar?

big shot, heavy hitter on the mainstream
you wanna look shanty in the bentley
be a snob and never act friendly
you wanna have big fame, let me explain
what happends to these stars and their big brains
first they get played like all damn day
long as you sell everything will be o.k
then you get dissed by the media and fans
things never stay the same way they began
i heard that some never give full to the fullest
that's while fools end up dining on the bullet
think everything's fine in the big time
see me in my lex' with the chrome raised high
so you wanna roll far and live large?
it ain't all that goes with bein' a rockstar

my own son don't know me
i'm chillin' in the hotel room lonely
but i thank god i'm with my homies
but sometimes i wish i was back home
but only no radio or video didn't show me
no love, the phony, gotta hit the road slowly
so the record gets pushed by sony
i'm in the middle like monie
and the press say that my own people disown me
and the best way back is to keep your head straight
never inflate the cranium
they're too worried about them honies at the paladium
who just wanna cling on, swing on, and so on
go on, fall off, the hoes roll on
'til the next rock superstar with no shame
give him a year, he'll be right out the game
the same as the last one who came before him
gained fame, started gettin' ignored, i warned him
assured him, this ain't easy take it from weezy
sleezy people wanna be so cheesy, the fuckin' lethal
"assassins, assassins"

 scratching "livin' legend"

when i rock it don't stop
like the burnin' sensation when i drop off this mic
can't stop this for life
the rappin' that is
if i came wack, it'd hurt me more than it'd hurt y'all
like when parents slap their kids
what's about to happen is
 nah, what had happened was

rackin' up these dubs, steady packin up the clubs
is there any other crew who does it quite like us?

like a club dj throwin' on more bounce
and y'all know how we do it over here in l.a
everybody and they mamma ?
and i say what i mean when i put it in a verse
rhymes like ? your words would snatch a purse
from a blind senior citizen

your fans, they suck it up, the truth must be exposed
i jump on stage and fuck em up
jabroni's never stand a chance against rap entertainment's most electrifying man
mics short circuit soon as they touch my hands
sell my music on the streets to stay in touch with my fans
man, my crew can't be beat 
we got this thing locked like the door on a white lady's automoblie
when she sees me cross the street
flat out truth when i speak
with no time for plateaus i keep striving for the peak until i go insane
and it's as plain as the clothes on an undercover cop
that i got a fan base that'll never stop growing, been around for a while
and for y'all who not knowin...

the mind activation, react like i'm facin'
time like pappy mason, with pens i'm embracin'
wipe the sweat off my dome, spit the phlegm on the streets
suede timbs on my feet makes my cipher complete
whether cruisin' in a six cab or montero jeep
i can't call it, the beats make me fallin' asleep
i keep fallin', but never fallin' six feet deep

yet i'm the mild, money gettin' style, rollin' foul
the versatile, honey stickin', wild, golden child
dwellin' in the rotten apple, you get tackled
or caught by the devil's lasso, shit is a hassle
there's no days for broke days
we sell it, smoke pays, while all the old folks pray
to jesús, soakin' their sins in trays of holy water
odds against nas are slaughter
thinkin' a word best describin' my life to name my daughter
my strength, my son, the star will be my resurrection
born in correction, all the wrong shit i did
he'll lead a right direction
how you livin'? large, a broker charge, cards are mediocre
you flippin' coke or playin' spit, spades, and strip poker?

i'm the young city bandit, hold myself down single handed
for murder raps, i kick my thoughts alone, get remanded
born alone, die alone, no crew to keep my crown or throne
i'm deep by sound alone, caved inside, 1,000 miles from home
i need a new nigga for this black cloud to follow
 cause while it's over me it's too dark to see tomorrow
tryin' to maintain, i flip, fill the clip to the tip
picturin' my peeps not eatin' can make my heartbeat skip
and i'm amped up, they locked the champ up
even my brain's in handcuffs
headed for indiana, stabbin' women like the phantom
the crew is lampin', big willie style
check the chip toothed smile, plus i profile wild
stash loot in fly clothes, burnin' dollars to light my stoge
walk the blocks with a bop, checkin' dames
plus the games people play bust the problems of the world today

uh, wolf haley, golf wang

i'm a fuckin' walkin' paradox   no, i'm not
threesomes with a fuckin' triceratops, reptar
rappin' as i'm mockin' deaf rock stars
wearin' synthetic wigs made of anwar's dreadlocks
bedrock, harder than a motherfuckin' flintstones
making crack rocks outta pussy nigga fishbones
this nigga jasper tryin' to get grown
about five, seven of his bitches in my bedroom
swallow the cinnamon, i'ma scribble this sin and shit
while syd is tellin' me that she's been gettin' intimate with men
 syd, shut the fuck up 
here's the number to my therapist  shit 
you tell him all your problems, he's fuckin' awesome with listenin'

wolf haley, golf wang
wolf haley, golf fuckin' wang

jesus called, he said he's sick of the disses
i told him to quit bitchin', this isn't a fuckin' hotline
for a fuckin' shrink, sheesh, i already got mine
and he's not fuckin' workin', i think i'm wastin' my damn time
i'm clockin' three past six and goin' postal
this the revenge of the dicks; that's nine cocks that cock 9's
this ain't no v. tech shit, or columbine
but after bowling, i went home for some damn adventure time
 what'd you do?  i slipped myself some pink xannies  yeah 
and danced around the house in all over print panties
my mom's gone, that fuckin' broad will never understand me
i'm not gay, i just wanna boogie to some marvin
 what you think of hayley williams? 
fuck her, wolf haley robbin' them
i'll crash that fuckin' airplane at that faggot nigga b.o.b is in
and stab bruno mars in his goddamn esophagus
and won't stop until the cops come in
i'm an overachiever, so how about i start a team of leaders
and pick up stevie wonder to be the wide receiver?  cool 
green paper, gold teeth, and pregnant golden retrievers
all i want   fuck money, diamonds, and bitches; don't need 'em
but where the fat ones at? i got somethin' to feed 'em
it's some cooking books, the black kids never wanted to read 'em
snap back, green ch ch chia fuckin' leaves
it's been a couple months
and tina still ain't perm her fuckin' weave
damn

wolf haley, golf wang
wolf haley, golf wang, yeah
goddamn goblin
wolf haley, golf wang
wolf haley, golf wang, yeah

they say success is the best revenge
so i beat deshay up with the stack of magazines i'm in
oh, not again  another critic writing report
i'm stabbin' any bloggin' faggot hipster with a pitchfork
still suicidal, i am
i'm wolf, tyler put this fuckin' knife in my hand
i'm wolf, ace gon' put that fuckin' hole in my head
and i'm wolf, that was me who shoved a cock in your bitch
 what the fuck, man?  fuck the fame and all the hype, g
i just wanna know if my father would ever like me
but i don't give a fuck, so he's probably just like me
a motherfuckin' goblin
 fuck everything, man  that's what my conscience said
then it bunny hopped off my shoulder, now my conscience dead
now the only guidance that i had is splattered on cement
actions speak louder than words, let me try this shit
dead


we fight every night, now that's not kosher
i reminisce with bliss of when we was closer
and wake up to be greeted by an argument again
you act like you're ten
so immature, i try to concentrate on a cure
and keep lookin' at the front door
thinkin' if i were to evacuate
you'd probably be straighter than straight
and wouldn't have so much hate
cause you don't know the pain i feel when i see you smilin'
and when i roll up you start wilin'
so i front like everything's hunky dory
but it's a whole different story
you don't like the fact that i'm me
i don't put on a show
when it comes time for you to have company
and your friends don't understand your choice of man
they speak proper while my speech is from a garbage can
but regardless, you shouldn't have to be so raw
i'm lookin' at the front door

i'm lookin' at the front door
baby, i'm lookin' at the front door
i'm lookin' at the front door

and when you're with your friends, i glide to the side
until the spotlight is mine and never sabotage a good time
but when they're not around, the fights commence
i'm the one you're against and it doesn't make sense
cause i'm the one that you claim to love for life
but all i get is gray hairs and strife
and i can play some ole stuck up rapper role
and get foul every time you lose control
but that's not my order of operations
so i should win an award for lots of patience
cause that's all a fella can have
with a girl who's shootin' up his world like shaft
and i don't think that i can take it anymore
i'm lookin' at the front door


my friends always tell me how i'm lucky to possess
the best looking girl in the whole u.s
but every time you scream, you blow your finesse
tryin' to dis the professor
twenty four hours of acting sore
sometimes i wish you'd come down with lockjaw
so i don't have to take in the breakin'
you treat me like a burnt piece of bacon
it seems like just two years
back when we were bonded and not pierced
but now i keep itchin' to jet
sitting' in the chair just to stare, set to sprint
yo, sweetheart, you better take a hint
i say it now like i said it before
i'm lookin' at the front door

anarchists put a flame to a tire, walk around with the fire round necks
mankind gotta deal with a new kind of mind i'm a quick death wrapped in a threat
tell these fuzzy little weak heart bunny babies back up or get wet
never mind where you draw the line, i got a mind for crime, it's all disrespect
i'm a oil rig fire in the flesh, you're a lunchbox walking erect
tasty treats from the lungs to the flesh of the neck
who's hungry? the table's set, come get it
pain is a game then you better run with it, have fun with it, enjoy your suffering
kernel panic, terminal rushin'
empty the clip while your clip's still bufferin'

look in the eye of the violent and villainous
we are the murderous militants
we are the pirates that hide on the island invade or we wilding
marauding and murdering merchantmen
we have been cursed by the curs
we shooting first on our turf
pay us our proper respect
you pray for your god to end the perverse
he sent the worst of the worst
every death demon disperse
we put them all in a hearse
we put them under the earth
we are the savages ravaging hell
death in the air, we relish the smell
we are the hand of the lord
we are the hand with the sword
taking the heads of the faith
we are the sealers of fate
we are the fangs of the snake

let's go 
huh?
huh?
let's go 
huh?
huh?
huh?

the enemies of the state
pardon me, your mistake
see, i'm raised to eat pain
appetite for sliced face
me and mike mount the hellcat
armed to the pearl whites like yikes 
twenty cents gets your ghost ejected
it's free now, go to the light
me and mike bring d'lite to the knife fight
get twenty nine grand sliced
me, i just take it light
might light twenty nine grand up in a night
tongue lash slash in defiance
born to brawl boy, the bastard alliance
hardy harr, you a laugh, i'm a riot
that's not a brag, that's science 

back from the bellows of hell
back from the back of a jail in the cell
back from the gun and the priest to the con and the creed
back to the streets from the east
back to the belly of beast
back to the place of my peace
back to me holding my piece
anything working disturbing that peace
will certainly meet the deceased, capiche?
oh, why must i tell 'em again?
what must i tell 'em, my friend?
that we are born into sin
and we are worshiping murderers
nothing but evil duplicitous men
i know you heard of 'em all
we should just murder 'em all
we should just murder and ball
we dance on the ruins we looting from all of they palace's walls

let's go

whether for worse or better
time s been working against us since forever
it could really work if we work together
but what happens when one wants too much
do we let it go or

do we give it another try
or finally find the good in a goodbye
maybe right one, but wrong time, but it s cool
either way it goes, we re never in control because

we try to decide in our minds who s right
heaven only knows
we like to tell ourselves little lies to get by
heaven only knows
we don t even know if whether things ll ever get better
or not, we tried so why not move on with your life
don t make no sense wasting your time
heaven only knows

yeah, i know it hurts but it gets better
try to ride out the storm and weather the weather
why settle for less than you want?
you can t ignore you need more than smoke and mirrors
you ll get what you deserve  what you deserve 
when you know just how much you re worth
nothing less than someone who will put you first
either way it goes, you re never in control because

we try to decide in our minds who s right
heaven only knows
we like to tell ourselves little lies to get by
heaven only knows
we don t even know if whether things ll ever get better
or not, we tried so why not move on with your life
don t make no sense wasting your time
heaven only knows

heaven only know  heaven only knows 
heaven only knows
thought you had somebody  but it didn t work 
when you play with love  sometimes it hurts 
you re thinking life is over  but it could be worse 
when it s really up to the stars  and the universe 
in the meantime, don t be sittin  around feeling sorry for yourself
 need to let it go 
 cause right now might be the right time to love somebody else
 heaven only knows 
it s not up to you, you don t get to choose
love has its own rules, just let it come to you

'cause we try to decide in our minds who s right
heaven only knows
we like to tell ourselves little lies to get by
heaven only knows
we don t even know if whether things ll ever get better
or not, we tried so why not move on with your life
don t make no sense wasting your time
heaven only knows


i really don t care, i really don t care
really don t care, i really don t care

i know i m not a typical guy, and your friends say i don t have a chance
but i wonder if you pay them no mind,  cause it s costing us time
can you give me a chance to show you why?
we should be forever again, forever again

ooh lets drive around town, don t really have a place to go
we could lay down by the sea and listen to the ocean s symphony

i really don t care, really really don t care
i really really don t care, i really don t care

haven t kissed this long in quite some time
have you ever felt the love like this?
i wonder if you re changing your mind
it feels like ecstasy the second time
loving you forever again, forever again
you ll never be blue

you'd do just about anything to look into their eyes
have you finally found the one you've given your heart to
only to find that one won't give their heart to you
have you ever closed your eyes and
dreamed that they were there
and all you can do is wait for the day when they will care

have you ever loved somebody
so much it makes you cry
have you ever needed something
so bad you can't sleep at night

yeah.  this the one they told me not to put out.  but you got to give the people what they want.  so brothers, sisters, i ve been holding this one back.  this one for y all.  let s go

i'm feeling numb, thinking of changing my name to crystal meth
i m playing this game, holding my mic like a pistol, aiming at death
and i love nobody.  alone in this world that's how i came in it
but shit could flash and reverse the same in a minute
i don't even love life no more my niggas, i just live it
and i don't love love.  all the hurting is infinite
i cry myself to sleep sometimes, wept a gallon of tears
from malice, divorced mates to lost peers
drowned it in a haze of smoke and glasses that never ran empty
bottles of so co, cheap vodka and 20 20
spending my pennies for thoughts on quarts of henny
fame?  got none.  pain?  like the movie, have plenty
like a shotgun, double barrel fully loaded, ready to blow
i want to turn around and aim at myself
been failing my health.  i hardly even eat no more
my lunch is munchies from the corner store, tropical fantasy
me and my family, me and my niggas used to be tight
but now we see each other on the block with no pounds
and keep it moving.  gotta move on
i know i m doing it right.  i m still living, hustling life
still, shit

for all my niggas, smoke a pack a day
for all my niggas, hold a bottle, drink the pain away
what type of life is this?
for all my niggas getting the cash and all my niggas who chill on the ave
let s keep living
for all my niggas, drink the pain away
for all my niggas, smoke a pack of newports a day
what type of life is this?
for all my niggas getting the cash and all my niggas who chill on the ave
let s keep living.  let s keep living

grew up a child of an alcoholic, sister to schizophrenic
and already inherited one and they both are genetic
when sun falls, i gets no sleep.  nights is filled
with party and bullshit, bacardi and full clips
just to deal with it.  got a full heart, but i don't feel
with it no more.  i have fury of woman who scorned
just live my life like the x files and trust nobody
forgetting everyone.  now i'm just for getting the money
funny how shit can change and switch up, fragile to rip on you
spent too much of my young life just trying to stitch shit up
uh.  i'm living day by day now.  every step is play by play
hand to mouth.  i'm just trying to make the moments count
eyes read, stressing my soul.  chest grows
from heavy smoking addict since nine.  a nicotine addict
devoted at it but, still, i need some type of release
i quit the trees at least
yo, i'm learning, niggas, but i'm slow at it
always gave my motherfuckers the benefit of the doubt
but it seems that everybody s just out for self
i used to love her.  now i gotta make her work for my wealth
i gotta eat, y'all

for all my niggas, smoke a pack a day
for all my niggas, hold a bottle, drink the pain away
what type of life is this?
for all my niggas getting the cash and all my niggas who chill on the ave
let s keep living
for all my niggas, drink the pain away
for all my niggas, smoke a pack of newports a day
what type of life is this?
for all my niggas getting the cash and all my niggas who chill on the ave
let s keep living.  let s keep living

it s from rapping to nicotine, niggas clapping and niggas ll fiend
from some shit i haven t seen to everything i ve been through
it's like losing the love of your life twice in the same night
being deaf for years, gained your hearing and losing your sight
trying to shine but i m just getting eclipsed
i'm just trying to find the perfect words to fall from my lips
thinking too hard about what shit has fallen mainly the chips
hoping the next time it s storming, that i'm not attempting to slit wrists
got nothing now.  i ll work my way up from the bottom
to the top of the ladder, claim what's rightfully mine
i m working against time.  it's been too long
and i haven't even had a chance to leave y'all yet.  i apologize
getting older, wiser, seen the picture painted
my destiny fated for this and not for easy times
i put my heart in these rhymes for always
love it or leave it or ready to die
yeah, i m ready.  come on


i ain't even gon  lie, 2019 i'm 'bout to be on my singin  shit
like, mi, mi, mi, mi, mi, mi, mi
fuck you, you, you, you, you, you, you
take your bitch this year and shit
that's gon' be the reason why

all of my peers is threatened by me
i can tell, i can see jealousy livin' in need
these niggas sick 'cause i won't quit
they stuck in the sea, stuck in the wave
stuck in the deep end of the spectrum
they drownin', they floaties ain't working
should ve just stuck to the beats
even though your body is a he, you really a she
fans ll say your rappin' is a a when it s really a d
they get a b for brainwash, the sucky disease
worst part of that is you believe, sneeze
i'm cold as 23 degrees below the only number startin' with a z
that's why they sleep, so i ma crank the heat
so hot, the helium's makin' it hard for them to breathe  ahh 
i'm still independent, i run my own shit  run my own shit 
i can't say the same for niggas i've grown with  grown with 
but keep it real, i'd rather split half of a mill'
than keep the whole hunnid, so my deal with      is comin'
i heard so and so say so and so's they only competition
i started laughin', you must be kiddin'
'cause if so and so drop another so and so
you and i know your conversation is good riddance
with good mittens, you couldn't catch any ball i'm pitchin'
but this ain't a game of bars, no
this is a game about who you with and who you know
and if you with them niggas at the top, then you could blow
so here i go

i gotta keep a chopper on the table in front of the bible
so right before i spray, i pray
that don't nobody try me, high key
make 'em grow wings and make 'em fly away

i wish a nigga would try me, i'm trigger happy
i wish a nigga would try me, gon' make me happy
i wish a nigga would try me, i'm trigger happy
i wish a nigga would try me, gon' make me happy

this the shit that make carl chery neck snap
this the shit that make rob markman pimp slap
your favorite blogger who's callin' himself an author
but never wrote shit about who i fathered, and that's awful
i know how this goes, you niggas sleep 'til i make a heap
then all of a sudden you on my meat, proceed to beat
but nigga guess what, i'll never skeet
'cause i will never be turned on by a fuckin' leech, capeesh?
logic and his manager tried to ruin my deal
i guess that's what happens when you tell a nigga
who spent his whole career proving that he's black
that he ain't black still
but when you taking food out my fridge, i ain't gotta chill
and that for real, this ain't a diss
he won't respond, this ain't a risk
this is me sayin' none of you bigger artists can cock block shit
this industry is a bitch
i been patiently waitin' to blow
ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the idk show
it's the same as before with a lot better flow
and the melodies and the hooks that prolly take your ho, like

i gotta keep a chopper on the table in front of the bible
so right before i spray, i pray
that don't nobody try me, high key
make 'em grow wings and make 'em fly away

i wish a nigga would try me, i'm trigger happy
i wish a nigga would try me, gon' make me happy
i wish a nigga would try me, i'm trigger happy
i wish a nigga would try me, gon' make me happy

used to be a dreamer
dreamin' of a fire

uh, my mama used to pray that she'd see me in yale
it's fucked up she gotta see me in jail
on the visit with lil papi, it hurt even though i seemed to be well
they got a smoker with a key to my cell, damn
and even worst, my judge black don't wanna see me do well
it's either that or black people for sale
gave me two to four years like, "fuck your life, meet me in hell"
and let it burn like lucifer, you look even stupider
tryna impress them people in power when power abusin' us
for 44 dollars a hour, you coward they using ya
is it self hate that made you send me upstate?
this where the so called "real niggas" sweeping up for cupcakes
and that's your phone time, if you ain't got no money, you ain't online
hey call your son, call your daughter just to wish them more prime
oh god, don't let them streets get a hold of 'em
your daughter fuckin' now, it's gon be a cold summer
your son trapping, and your homie giving o's to him
and if he fuck that paper up, he puttin' holes through him
and you just wanna make it home, so you can show it to him
and them people ain't finna give no parole to ya
they want blood, we all hangin' with a noose on our neck
my celly mom just died, he wanna use my collect
and he won't make it to the wake unless he give 'em a check
we still niggas though, what you expect?

i just won
i was on the corner with the reefa
and they got us warring for our freedom
see my brother blood on the pavement
how you wake up in the mornin' feelin' evil?
uhh, trauma
when them drugs got a hold of your mama
and the judge got a hold on your father
go to school, bullet holes in the locker

ain't no ptsds, them drugs keep it at ease
they shot that boy 20 times when they could've told him just freeze
could've put him in a cop car, but they let him just bleed
the ambulance, they coming baby, just breathe
that's what the old lady said when she screamed
this nightmare on elm street, friday the 13th
and in the 13th amendment, it don't say that we kings
they say that we legally slaves if we go to the bing
they told kaep' stand up if you wanna play for a team
and all his teammates ain't saying a thing  stay woke 
if you don't stand for nothing, you gon' fall for something
and in the 60's, if you kneeled, you'd prolly be killed
but they don't kill you now, they just take you out of your deal
kill your account, look where money get spilled
check it, and they don't kill you now, they just take you out of your deal
kill your account, look where money get spilled

i just won
i was on the corner with the reefa
and they got us warring for our freedom
see my brother blood on the pavement
how you wake up in the mornin' feelin' evil?
uhh, trauma
when them drugs got a hold of your mama
and the judge got a hold on your father
go to school, bullet holes in the locker

how many times you send me to jail to know that i won't fail
invisible shackles on the king, 'cause shit, i'm on bail
i went from selling out arenas, now shit, i'm on sale
them cold nights starting to feel like hell, uhh
watching a black woman take my freedom
almost made me hate my people
when they label you felon, it's like they telling you they not equal
11 years going to court knowing they might keep you or drive you crazy
23 hours in a cell, somebody save me
i'm on a jail call, trying to explain it to my baby
i gotta do the calendar twice, and that's a maybe
trauma

i just won
i was on the corner with the reefa
and they got us warring for our freedom
see my brother blood on the pavement
how you wake up in the mornin' feelin' evil?
uhh, trauma

and the judge got a hold on your father

" perfectly fine, that's fine "

said nigga brother, nigga brother, what you living for?
is you gon' finish what you started? what you quitting for?
they told me god gave me a mission
but i'm missing the supplies to complete it
i ain't the one you should read in, i'm used to being defeated
so nigga, brother who you standing with?
i'm independent 'cause these parties never planned for this
brother nigga with a brain, unintentionally swerving in every lane
the feeling's never the same, you chase what you couldn't gain
i'm so accustomed to flames, i couldn't tell you what's fire
situation is dire, hear them calls from the choir
the disposition acquired from my position on earth
it's telling me "decapitate everything for what it's worth "
when i die, these words gon' need separate caskets and a hearse
i don't rhyme, i freeze time and let these hands just do the work
i'm in tandem with my curse, going manic since my birth
see the canvas as a planet i'm commanding with my nerves, ah

tell 'em boys, don't run from us
i been down too long, cousin
i been down too long, brother
tell the world, i ain't scared of nothing
tell the world, i ain't scared of jumping
tell my boy i want a crib in london
tell the world to stop tripping, i'll
build a different house with some different functions
tell 'em boys, don't run from us
i been down too long, cousin
i been down too long, brother
tell the world, i ain't scared of nothing
tell the world, i ain't scared of jumping
tell my boy, i want a crib in london
tell the world to stop tripping, i'll
build a different house with some different functions

try to treat man like baby
feel the teeth sink in like rabies
ah ah ah, ah, ah ah ah ah
ah ah ah, ah, ah ah ah ah
boy, you know you don't look fly
them gold chains turn your neck green, bye
ah ah ah, ah, ah ah ah ah
ah ah ah, ah, ah ah ah ah

nothin' different now  woo   all around now  woo  
who you keep around now? that's a big reflection
don't like how they talkin' to me, why they walkin' to me?
wear your shit upon your sleeve, stop projectin' on me
sense is your surround sound, what's your take on me?
kill the ego now, what that make of me?
angle widescreen, couple sips of tanqueray
i'ma throw a couple punches, i'ma do it anyway
chin up little son, i slide in like the macarena
lose time, pen it, style spiced up, jalape o
supersonic, move through tunnel, two wheel cycle, slightly
silence crowd better than 9 millimeter with extended suppressor
bustin' out the function, highly comfortable
got this hot ting on my body, man, my sweat lethal
sweet kisses like the candy out the carnival
i'ma call my own shots, hit the audible

impending death is the only sign of life
i'm throwing hail marys 'til i die
throw it up, all i have is peace of mind, throwin' up
have my wings clipped, i don't need them shits
learn to fly again
fast track to last place, i swear
i've never been up top but i'm up here somewhere
out here, nobody can tell me shit
shit, never mind what i did back then
you should take a look at yourself instead
maybe you can find yourself, love yourself
here's to health and here's to wealth, all together now

tell 'em boys, don't run from us
i been down too long, cousin
i been down too long, brother
tell the world, i ain't scared of nothing
tell the world, i ain't scared of jumping
tell my boy, i want a crib in london
tell the world to stop tripping, i'll
build a different house with some different functions
tell 'em boys, don't run from us
i been down too long, cousin
i been down too long, brother
tell the world, i ain't scared of nothing
tell the world, i ain't scared of jumping

have you ever met a girl that you tried to date
but a year to make love she wanted you to wait
let me tell ya a story of my situation
i was talkin' to this girl from the u.s. nation
the way that i met her was on tour at a concert
she had long hair and a short miniskirt
i just got onstage drippin', pourin' with sweat
i was walkin' through the crowd and guess who i met
i whispered in her ear, "come to the picture booth
so i can ask you some questions to see if you are a hundred proof"
i asked her her name, she said blah blah blah
she had 9 10 pants and a very big bra
i took a couple of flicks and she was enthused
i said, "how do you like the show?" she said, "i was very amused"
i started throwin' bass, she started throwin' back mid range
but when i sprung the question, she acted kind of strange
then when i asked, "do ya have a man," she tried to pretend
she said, "no i don't, i only have a friend"
come on
i'm not even goin' for it, this is what i'm goin' sing

you, you got what i need
but you say he's just a friend
and you say he's just a friend, oh baby
you got what i need
but you say he's just a friend
but you say he's just a friend, oh baby
you got what i need
but you say he's just a friend
but you say he's just a friend

so i took blah blah's word for it at this time
i thought just havin' a friend couldn't be no crime
'cause i have friends and that's a fact
like agnes, agatha, germaine, and jack
forget about that, let's go into the story
about a girl named blah blah blah that adored me
so we started talkin', getttin' familiar
spendin' a lot of time so we can build up
a relationship or some understanding
how it's gonna be in the future we was plannin'
everything sounded so dandy and sweet
i had no idea i was in for a treat
after this was established, everything was cool
the tour was over and she went back to school
i called every day to see how she was doin'
every time that i called her it seemed somethin' was brewin'
i called her room, a guy picked up, but then i called again
i say, "yo, who was that?" "oh, he's just a friend"
don't gimme that, don't ever gimme that
jus' bust this

you, you got what i need
but you say he's just a friend
and you say he's just a friend, oh baby
you got what i need
but you say he's just a friend
but you say he's just a friend, oh baby
you got what i need
but you say he's just a friend
but you say he's just a friend

so i came to her college on a surprise visit
to see my girl that was so exquisite
it was a school day, i knew she was there
the first semester of the school year
i went to a gate to ask where was her dorm
this guy made me fill out a visitor's form
he told me where it was and i was on my way
to see my baby doll, i was happy to say
i arrived in front of the dormitory
"yo, could you tell me where is door three?"
they showed me where it was for the moment
i didn't know i was in for such an event
so i came to her room and opened the door
oh, snap  guess what i saw?
a fella tongue kissin' my girl in her mouth
i was so in shock my heart went down south
so please listen to the message that i send
don't ever talk to a girl who says she just has a friend

 the offical adventures of... 

psk we're making that green
people always say, "what the hell does that mean?"
p for the people who can't understand
how one homeboy became a man
s for the way we scream and shout
one by one i'm knocking you out
k for the way my dj cutting
other mc's, man you ain't saying nothing
rocking on to the break of dawn
i think code money, your time is on


driving in my car down the avenue
towing on a j, sipping on some brew
turned around, see the fly young lady
pull to the curb and park my mercedes
said "fly lady, now you're looking real nice
sweeter than honey, sugar and spice"
told her my name was mc schoolly d
all about making that cash money
she said, "schoolly d, i know your game
heard about you in the hall of fame"
i said, "mama, mama, i tell you no lies
cause all i wanna do is to get you high
and uh   lay you down and do the body rock"
took a walk to the corner, got into the car
took a little trip to a fancy bar
copped some brew, some j, some coke
tell you now, brother, this ain't no joke
she got me to the crib, she laid me on the bed
i fucked her from my toes to the top of my head
i finally realized the girl was a whore
gave her ten dollars, she asked me for some more


clinton road one saturday night
towing on a cheeba i was feeling alright
then my homie homie called me on the phone
his name is chief keith, but we call him bone
told me 'bout this party on the southside
copped my pistol, jumped into the ride
got at the bar, copped some flack
copped some cheeba cheeba, it wasn't wack
got to the place, and who did i see
a sucker ass nigga trying to sound like me
put my pistol up against his head
and said, "you sucker ass nigga i should shoot you dead"
a thought ran across my educated mind
said, man, schoolly d ain't doing no time
grabbed the microphone and i started to talk
sucker ass nigga, man, he started to walk



back in the days when i was a teenager
before i had status and before i had a pager
you could find the abstract listenin' to hip hop
my pops used to say, it reminded him of bebop
i said, "well, daddy, don't you know that things go in cycles?
way that bobby brown is just amping like michael"
it's all expected, things are for the lookin'
if you got the money, quest is for the bookin'
come on everybody, let's get with the fly mode
still got room on the truckload of black boom
listen to the rhymes, then get a mental picture
of this black man, and black woman fixture
why do i say that? 'cause i gotta speak the truth, man
doin' what we feel for the music is the proof, and
planted on the ground, the act is so together
bona fide strong, you need leverage to sever
the unit, yes, the unit, yes, the unit called the jazz is
delivering each year an lp filled with street goods
you can find it on your rack in your record store
if you get the record, say your thoughts are adored
and appreciated, 'cause we're ever so glad we made it
we work hard, so we gotta thank god
dishin' out the plastic, do the dance till you're spastic
if you diss it gets drastic
listen to the rhyme, 'cause it's time to make gravy
if it moves your booty, then shake, shake it, baby
all the way to africa, a.k.a. the motherland
stick out the left, then i'll ask for the other hand
that's the right hand, black man
only if you are noted as my man
if i get the credit, then i think i deserve it
if you fake moves, don't fix your mouth to word it
get in the zone of positivity, not negativity
'cause we gotta strive for longevity
if you botch up, what's in that 
 what?  a pair of nikes, size ten and a half

we gotta make moves  words 
never, ever, ever could we fake moves  come on, come on 
we gotta make moves  words 
never, ever, ever could we fake moves  come on, come on 
we gotta make moves
never, ever, ever could we fake moves  come on, come on 
we gotta make moves
never, ever, ever could we fake moves  come on, come on 

"time, time is a ship on a merciless sea
drifting toward an abyss of nothingness
until it can be recharted for its own destiny
time is an inanimate object paying and paying and paying for no justification for belief
time is dancing, boogalooing away all memories of past "

we gotta be a winner all the time
can't fall prey to a hip hop crime
with the dope raps and dope tracks we move blocks
from the fly girlies to the hardest of the rocks
musically the quest, is on the rise
we on these excursions so you must realize
that continually, i pop my zulu 
if you don't like it, get off the zulu tip
so what can you do in the times which exist
you can't fake moves on your brother or your sis
but if your sis is a , brother is a jerk
leave 'em both alone and continue with your work
whatever it may be in today's society
everything is fair, least that's how it seems to me
you must be honest and true to the next
don't be phony and expect one not to flex
especially if you rhyme, you have to live by the pen
your man is your man, then treat him like your friend
all it is, is the code of the streets
so listen to the knowledge being dropped over beats
beats that are hard, beats that are funky
they could get you hooked like a crackhead junkie
what you gotta do is know the tribe is in the sphere
the abstract poet, prominent like shakespeare
 or edgar allan poe, or langston hughes, or... 

we gotta make moves
never, ever, ever could we fake moves  come on, come on 
we gotta make moves
never, ever, ever could we fake moves  come on, come on 
we gotta make moves
never, ever, ever could we fake moves  come on, come on 
we gotta make moves
never, ever, ever could we fake moves  come on, come on 

" time is running out on black power advocates in the day and white thighed supporters at night
every time you see them, they're chasin' some white woman with their tongue hangin' out
time is running and passing, passing and running, running and passing, passing and running "

his ma  smoked the crack while she was pregnant so he can't even help that he crazy
he goin' to jail, it s inevitable, forreal

i ain't have nobody to give me no hope
i hope my momma ain't doin' no coke
i used to wish that my daddy was livin'
i had a dream that i seen him as ghost
i used to act up when i went to school
thought it was cool, but i really was hurt
wanted my family to come to my games
my mama couldn't make it 'cause she was at work
lived with my grandma, she took me to church
really no i ain't wanna go
remember i kissed my aunt in the casket
and her forehead was cold
i was like 4 years old
we couldn t afford no clothes
it was hand me down
who would think a nigga get a grammy now?
got a black judge tryna tear me down
all this jail time probably wear me down
turn the lights off in the bathroom
screaming, "bloody, bloody, bloody mary" now
havin  nightmares about candyman
with the tool on me like a handyman
killed my lil' cousin, i m like, "damn it, man"
had to see the footage on a camera, man
on the pavement, with his brains out
with the white sheet, he was laid out
wanna ask 'ye, "is this a choice?"
it was like this when i came out
what the fuck is you really complaining 'bout?
i know niggas that's never gon  make it out
this that shit you won't see in the media
poor get poorer and the rich gettin' greedier
lot of daddies goin' back and forth out of jail
lot of sons growin' up and repeating them
this the belly of the beast, you won't make it out
man, this shit was designed just to eat us up
and my momma told, "nigga, keep it up
you gon' end up in prison, just sweepin' up"
remember, nobody never believed in us
when they see us now, they can't believe it's us, no

i think it's funny how
we used to go to school, play sega's
and then, next thing you know, you runnin' 'round with glock .40s
we ain't never believed in the police, they was shootin' us

yeah, they called it the projects, they put us in projects
what they gon' do with us? can't call the cops yet
you might just get popped at
'cause they the ones shootin' us
i'm on my mom's steps, it's like a bomb threat
the violence pursuing us, i ain't meet god yet
'cause i'm on the block where
it's just me and lucifer, look what they do to us
they know we in poverty
when i went to court, the judge said, "meek, you a menace to society"
huh, you said, you would give me a chance, your honor, why would you lie to me?
16 more years of probation, you know you gon' get some more time on me, huh
whole hood goin' crazy, babies havin' babies
she was fourteen, actin' like she eighty
got pregnant by a nigga that was locked up in them cages
and the story goes on, if you make it, you amazing  word up 

see, i got homie that's a billionaire
and i be tryin' to explain it to him like
if your mom ain't on crack or if she got a job and she doing eight hours a day
and your daddy in the graveyard or in the jail cell, who the fuck gon' babysit?



i know i can
be what i wanna be
if i work hard at it
i'll be where i wanna be
i know i can  i know i can  
be what i wanna be  be what i wanna be  
if i work hard at it  if i work hard it  
i'll be where i wanna be  i'll be where i wanna be  

be, b boys and girls, listen up
you can be anything in the world, in god we trust
an architect, doctor, maybe an actress
but nothing comes easy, it takes much practice
like, i met a woman who's becoming a star
she was very beautiful, leaving people in awe
singing songs, lena horne, but the younger version
hung with the wrong person, got her strung on that heroin
cocaine, sniffing up drugs, all in her nose
could've died, so young, now looks ugly and old
no fun 'cause when she reaches for hugs, people hold their breath
'cause she smells of corrosion and death
watch the company you keep and the crowd you bring
'cause they came to do drugs and you came to sing
so if you gonna be the best, i'ma tell you how
put your hands in the air, and take the vow

i know i can  i know i can  
be what i wanna be  be what i wanna be  
if i work hard at it  if i work hard it  
i'll be where i wanna be  i'll be where i wanna be  
i know i can  i know i can  
be what i wanna be  be what i wanna be  
if i work hard at it  if i work hard it  
i'll be where i wanna be  i'll be where i wanna be  

be, b boys and girls, listen again
this is for grown looking girls who's only 10
the ones who watch videos and do what they see
as cute as can be, up in the club with fake id
careful, 'fore you meet a man with hiv
you can host the tv like oprah winfrey
whatever you decide, be careful, some men be
rapists, so act your age, don't pretend to be
older than you are, give yourself time to grow
you thinking he can give you wealth, but so
young boys, you can use a lot of help, you know
you thinking life's all about smoking weed and ice
you don't wanna be my age and can't read and write
begging different women for a place to sleep at night
smart boys turn to men and do whatever they wish
if you believe you can achieve, then say it like this

i know i can  i know i can  
be what i wanna be  be what i wanna be  
if i work hard at it  if i work hard it  
i'll be where i wanna be  i'll be where i wanna be  
now, go 
i know i can  i know i can  
be what i wanna be  be what i wanna be  
if i work hard at it  if i work hard it  
i'll be where i wanna be  i'll be where i wanna be  

be, be fore we came to this country
we were kings and queens, never porch monkeys
there was empires in africa called kush
timbuktu, where every race came to get books
to learn from black teachers who taught greeks and romans
asian arabs and gave them gold, when
gold was converted to money it all changed
money then became empowerment for europeans
the persian military invaded
they heard about the gold, the teachings, and everything sacred
africa was almost robbed naked
slavery was money, so they began making slave ships
egypt was the place that alexander the great went
he was so shocked at the mountains with black faces
shot up they nose to impose what basically
still goes on today, you see?
if the truth is told, the youth can grow
they learn to survive until they gain control
nobody says you have to be gangstas, hoes
read more, learn more, change the globe
ghetto children, do your thing
hold your head up, little man, you're a king
young princess when you get your wedding ring
your man is saying "she's my queen"

i know i can  i know i can  
be what i wanna be  be what i wanna be  
if i work hard at it  if i work hard it  
i'll be where i wanna be  i'll be where i wanna be  
i know i can  i know i can  
be what i wanna be  be what i wanna be  
if i work hard at it  if i work hard it  
i'll be where i wanna be  i'll be where i wanna be  

save the music, y'all

the corner mean five, horns in disguise, throw on your slides
young niggas racist, smokers is basing
we seen the eyes laying up, playing the cut, what?
stay in the truck, something told me duck, folded me up
my shoulders struck out of luck, fucked the pradas up
fell in a daze like a golotta snuff, niggas tried to body me up
i'm in the lobby bleeding, niggas in the waiting office probably eating
and sprinting and beefing when they heard the shots called the precinct
and seen barber nieces beast, some niggas shot shallah features
and shot through his ellesses, bent the spinal cordless creatures
i'm gagging and flagging a cab down
guess who in the benz wagon, dragging my sound down macking
it was dale breedy the greedy, conniving ass snake genie
cop with a bikini who murdered tosh and benini
i'm feeling wheezy and i'm drained from the cheeba grieving
ain't even looking decent, seeing police niggas reaching

that splash against my hollow bones
that rocks my...

fleeing the crime scene speeding
beefing leaving behind cream, not even peeping that i was leaking
won't see the precinct just got a recent case beaten
still jakes are creeping, don't blow your spot, stay the weekend
keep the ruger peeling who's squealing few knew the dealings
keep the steel concealed in cause we got no time for feelings
eyes on the building guards are on the corners illing
million dollar block villain plotting on a killing
feel like, a superhero talking like a true deniro
they boost his ego found him broke down, reduced to zero
cops fill reports hoping i'll reveal my source, source

that splash against my hollow bones
that rocks my soul

outside the check cashing, flashing, dipped in fashion
five cherry faced faggots tried to cash in
they keep laughing   ghost, you'll get your face bashed in
who gave you these privileges son? why you maxing?
and we... fiending to take those
move slow, i'm hearing how you broke rob's nose
and i heard you keep a banging hammer, golden brass
diamonds embroideries that was stolen that you haven't reported, g
make very little noise, my shit hiccup
don't make this big stick up bigger, me and the boys
i thought for a second, then chose rather than froze
had the gem star in my hand... yo, what the fuck?
yo, that's when i ripped timothy, snatched and dipped
jumped right in back of him, had the mini axe tool, faxed him
shots rang off, bing boggle de dum


the sword it's the best weapon of all
two sharp edges, and a long spine
the blade is very thin and it's easily damaged
you remember that: the vital thing is the point
pay special attention to it, your life could depend on it


i ain't trying to be no d boy, i love music, i'm a b boy
are you the undercover or the decoy
i'm heavy with the d, trouble t roy
a pit with no muzzle about to bust your bubble like a keloid

we left a large solar cloud distinguished by size
interaction with the wise and civilized
the mind caused matter to fall into a center
a great deal of heat that'll radiate within ya
from out of this collision
the central cord became thick enough to trap its own light and bring vision
each drop full of hip hop energy
balanced on all sides such great symmetry
the bars unlocked the power of the stars
the mirror in the telescope pinpoint the gods
from a distance, acting as a guiding coach
analyze the board, universal approach
retune the soul to a certain pitch
changing the frequency frequently, hitting a certain switch
the love is paramount, the connect is brotherly
respect for the intellect and broad discovery

keep watch, lights out when the beat drop
keeping the streets locked
i'm calling all g's from each block, from each block
keep watch, lame niggas out there can kick rocks

and if he wasn't good buddha would not try to help him
"hey you have a pass from the..."

i came home, say, around a quarter to three
still so high, hypnotized
in a trance
from his body, so buttery brown and tantalizing
you woulda thought i needed help
from this feeling that i felt
so shook i had to catch my breath

oops, there goes my shirt up over my head
oh my
oops, there goes my skirt droppin' to my feet
oh my
ooh, some kinda touch caressing my legs
oh my
ooh, i'm turning red

i tried and i tried to avoid
but this thing was happening
swallowed my pride
let it ride and partied
but this body felt just like mine
i got worried
i looked over to the left
a reflection of myself
that's why i couldn't catch my breath

oops, there goes my shirt up over my head

a game of chess is like a swordfight:
you must think first before you move
toad style is immensely strong
and immune to nearly any weapon
when it's properly used it's almost invincible

raw i'ma give it to ya, with no trivia
raw like cocaine straight from bolivia
my hip hop will rock and shock the nation

weak mc's approach with slang that's dead

is comin' through with nuff niggas and nuff guns
so if you wanna come sweatin', stressin', contestin'
you'll catch a sharp sword to the midsection
don't talk the talk if you can't walk the walk
phony niggas are outlined in chalk
i'm mad vexed, it's what the projects made me
rebel to the grain, there's no way to barricade me
steamrollin' niggas like an 18 wheeler
with a drunk driver drivin', there's no survivin'

homicide's illegal and death is the penalty
what justifies the homicide, when he dies in his own iniquity?
it's the master of the mantis rapture comin' at ya
we have an apb on an mc killer
looks like the work of a master
evidence indicates that his stature
merciless like a terrorist hard to capture
the flow changes like a chameleon
plays like a friend and stabs you like a dagger
this technique attacks the immune system
disguised like a lie, paralyzin' the victim
you scream as it enters your bloodstream
erupts your brain from the pain these thoughts contain
movin' on a nigga with the speed of a centipede
and injure any motherfuckin' contender

my peoples, are you with me? where you at?
in the front, in the back, killa beez on attack

quarter pound of fire burnin' daily
harder to remember, gettin' harder to remember
i've been through enough to drive me crazy
i don't think my mama's gonna save me

maybe i'm not flyin', but i'm floatin'
if we're not headed to the top, where we goin'?
two miles an hour, can you picture me rollin'?
'cause life is so much better when you live in slow motion

ca one spliff a day'll keep the evil away
ca one spliff a day'll keep the evil away
ca one spliff a day'll keep the evil away
ca one spliff a day'll keep the evil away
 slow motion 
ca one spliff a day'll keep the evil away
ca one spliff a day'll keep the evil away
ca one spliff a day'll keep the evil away
ca one spliff a day'll keep the evil away

pardon me while i elevate
may not be on time, but i'm never late
blazin' like the player that you wanna be
flavor like your baby mama cup of tea
you see the company i'm keepin' now
feelin' like i'm dreamin', i keep feelin' like i'm dreamin'
don't come around if you don't be around
i been the man you believe me now

maybe i'm not flyin', but i'm floatin'
if we're not headed to the top, where we goin'?
two miles an hour, can you picture me rollin'?
'cause life is so much better when you live in slow motion

here in 1992 we present
the fabulous what's the scenario remix
whereas there are seven mc's
six which are in physical form, one which is in spiritual essence
and he goes by the name of, uh... hood 

check the vibe, walk that ass or get got
f it  shit  i lick buckshots
hood, madman, i rip up stages
lay down your wages, i'm wild like larry davis
extra, extra, pick up a clip
i'll tear ass out the frame  ha   and grab my dick  ohh  
i'm a rock'em sock'em robot kid, i drop bombs
i'm rugged and deadly, so i shit on the petty
i baseball bat a bastard, i'm bad news
i'm crazy and clever, cut throats of crews
death on the phono, my skills are porno
you say "oh no," you bitch ass homo
i bag up waste, electrifyin', i'm prime time
i slaughter a slime, i'm the greatest of all time
sick ass brother, nasty ass nigga
pump slugs in your face, and dump that ass in the river
two tears in a bucket, fuck it, kick the can
 say what, say what?  i'm a bad, bad man

quick is how i flip from the tip of the lip
punchin' out hits like gladys knight and the pips
the five foot assassin has just raided your area
your booty rhymes are wack and that's the reason i ain't hearin ya
 so   roll out the red carpet 'cause i'm kickin' this
vanilla ice platinum? that shit's ridiculous
excuse my french, but profanity is all i knew
and to you other sellouts, oh yeah, f you too
and let it be known, i'm not the one to step to
you're better off calling d nice to your rescue
freestyle fanatic, probably the best around
as for corny mcs, like chuck d, i shut 'em down
the artical don of hip hop and i won't stop
the five foot assassin has come to wreck 'nuff shop
so do like michael jackson and "remember the time"  do you remember? 
put on your dancin' shoes or somethin 'cause you sure can't rhyme

 big up, big up   enter new identity
next to say something 'cause you pass it to me
what does it take to check a technique?
 many styles, many styles  
hostile heat, brings bursts of energy
milo in de dance is the new identity
one two mic check, select for the ruffneck sect
ten to one that i come  correct  
in my cyphers on blocks, i bring box to connect with knots
so i can grow dreadlocks
maintain the rock  don't stop the rock 
maintain the rock  don't stop the rock 
kicking right inna your what's it not
i could rock longer but fair is fair
so c. brown are we in the clear?  yeahhh  
c. brown are we in the clear?  yeahhh  

makin moves y'all  moves y'all   on and on and on
 check it, check it out    to the break of, break of dawn
 who's that?   just one of the l.o.n.s
and a tribe called quest  east coast  to west
remix mad kick, more than metallica
to all mcs fall like the battlestar galactica
stampin', stompin', rompin' compton
 people all over the world   i'm promptin  style  
pick a style, any style, strong isle
representation, sensationalization
"scenario" for the radio, 'bls and kiss, so
 here we go yo   yeah
force, main source lp on the rise
in living color let's see through original eyes
and i'm out like shout, ooh ahh, ooh ahh
 ooh ahh, ooh ahh   there it is baby pah

flying in on a limb, slim trim, d i am
there i am  there i am   don't run from a grim
sight we be right, be polite for my mics
like i'm like  see sick, see syke 
and slip away, and off to the poconos
spot picked the clothes, hype swing the pretty pose
yamaha  ay ha may  
let's flip the funk, now it all spells  hey  
enough enough, ms. fitted i'm with it
if i did it, i was blitted, and probably shouldn't have quit it
cause yo, my vocal status at knight's like the gladys
bed rest, spread test, and yo i'm like the maddest
male, not female, hail from uniondale
bounce the b ball cause beats are being yelled
in the hallways always ringing with a  ho  
this is my two times nine on the scenario

check it out everybody, rhymes and mics
black mens gettin' loot  doin' what they like  
eight black brothers in the public eye
if you listen very close, i will tell you why
 hood   phife, milo, dinco and c. brown
shaheed, myself, and busta bust down
will commence to rock  rock   so bring on the flocks  flock  
in terrogation for the knockin of the box
the boom box ruler, controls the medulla
none come cooler, i win like shula
so bust out the moves as you start to pursue her
intensified mind, non blunt consumer
tip will come booty  well it's only a rumor  
the meanin' so deep that it starts brain tumors  tumors  
peace to hood baby from the midnight crooner
smoke 'em up later, if not then sooner

hey what we gon' do  dooo  in '92
even though we had fun  fuuun  in '91
wonderful my days, herb dream comin' down
ponna ponna new sound, leavin' cracks in the ground
what's goin on my man?  goddamn   and now my brain is hurtin'
listen up, busta, rhythm will hit 'em then i get 'em
flip on 'em, shit on 'em, hit on 'em, then i will sit on 'em
open up your mouth if you want the food
to get rude, flipmode, 'cause i'm in the mood
ah heh, ah heh  yeah man, that's how it goes
body drippin with blood comin out your nose
give me a band aid, what are you asking for?
 more   only your sacred and pure
adverse, zig zag, check it and the busta new rap
rap, busta rhymes, or bust this wicked rhymes
yeah y'all in '92, i'm packin my roach spray  anyway  
take a lick, tribe called quest, leaders of the new school
mad brother when stealthy
rrraaaow rraow rraow 
to my dragon, baby, stop whinin'
i see my influence still shinin'
more crazy in '92, uh oh, time to go, yo
that's the scenario 


let me flaunt the style, i think that the time's near
that we drop scuds, there won't be no duds here
rappers play the dumb, kinda on the space tip
but when they hear the jams, they be on the dilsnick
now i'm not for the rock, i know the territory
go ahead and try, that's a different story
similar to grimm, i could tell a better one
all about a kid, who couldn't rap and didn't run
stands on the side when the mic is getting dumb
resorts to bagging billy, asking could he have some
no never ever, go back and try again man
if you come back, i'll be the first to shake your hand
competition's good, it brings out the vital parts
the abstract poetic, majors in recital arts
do it for the kids, the elders and the rap peers
we know the job is done when we hear a lot of cheers
gotta feel the vibes, real from my creation
if the hands clap i'm filled with elation
here i am ghetto, full with a lot of steam
think i gotta, i think i gotta, i think i gotta scream
cause that's how good it feels child
let your hair down, so we can get buckwild
do your ill dance, don't think about the next man
we must have unity and think of the bigger plan
division we will fall, we must stick together, see
i'd like to take this time to say what's up to kool g
the name is q tip, the midnight marauder
giving nuff respects to afrika bambaataa
as a man in the world, i must do my job
take care of mama duke, i won't resort to rob
bob you'll get your dough, mase is my witness
obsessed with the rap, for it's the mental fitness
like shooting cee lo, and always hitting head cracks
the industry is luck, winning with the fake raps
peace to the crews who pump the real hip hop
not selling out, from hardrock to disc jock

i don't know what to say, but here i go freak it
if the papes come, then you know i'll seek it
i'm just a short brother, dark skin face
weigh a buck fifty, 36 waist
hair is crazy curly, flip like mr. furley
to this day i still believe that no mc can serve me
brothers try to front, but everybody know
i get more props than the arsenio hall show
party animal i was, but now i chill at home
all i do is write rhymes, eat, drink, shit, and bone
found my thrill in amityville, i'm always in the island
fudge and lucky know the time, they know who keeps 'em smiling
go out on my own, something that i gotta do
do what the hell i want and have no one to listen to
i'm prompt with my business and i do things on the double
yo, i'm out like buster douglas, i say peace to mc trouble
rest in peace

word up, rest in peace, and you know what else?
we got, we got, we got the vibes
all the people in long island, we got the vibes
brooklyn and queens, we got the vibes
uptown and now rule, we got the vibes
people upstate, we got the vibes
if you're in dc, you got the vibes
maryland, virginia, carolina vibes
out west, we got the vibes
in the bahamas, we got the vibes
over in europe, you know what, we got the vibes
and we gotta keep it alive, it goes um...

of rap i'm a fan, i've seen a whole lot of slums
good with the girls, i get a whole lot of 'em
from fat to skinny, freda to winnie
emma to cindy, constance to wendy
cause i be real friendly, never on the snotty side
i don't brag to brothers about the little papes i got
my vocal styles can vary, the sight is never scary
it's only legendary, my father well prepared me
my job ain't temporary, i'm here for the long shot
better yet the long term, i don't have a perm
in a way i do, call 'em the perma naps
i'm crazy slap happy and i'm scrappy and i'm nappy
when i get the mic in my hand with the crowd in the stands
it's as good as grand like that

yo, i wanna say peace and dedicate this joint to mc trouble
and to uh... trouble t roy
and to um... scott la rock
and to um... cowboy, you know what i'm sayin?
this is for the slain rappers and the fallen rappers, you know what i'm saying?
this is a special, special, special, special, special dedication
and also to my pops and also to vinia's moms, you know what i'm saying?
you just gotta keep it happy and keep the vibes going
cause this is vibes and stuff, and we out...


i just left my baby girl a message
sayin' i won't be coming home
i'd rather be alone
she doesn't fully understand me
cause i'd rather leave than to cheat
if she gives me some time
i can be the man she needs
but there's a lot of lust inside of me
and we've been together since our teenage years
i really don't mean to hurt her, but i need some time
to be alone

but when you love someone
you just don't treat them bad
oh, how i feel so sad
now that i wanna leave
she's crying her heart to me

i just need time to see
where i wanna be

i don't mean to hurt you, baby, oh, no, no...

never did i imagine
that you would play a major part
in a decision that's so hard
do i leave, do i stay, do i go?
or think about my life and what matters to me the most
girl, the love that we share is real
but in time your heart will heal
i'm not saying i'm gone, but i
have to find what life is like
without you

but when you love someone
you just don't treat them bad
oh, how i feel so sad

back in the days on the boulevard of linden
we used to kick routines and the presence was fittin'
it was i, the abstract
 and me, the five footer 
 i kicks the mad style so step off the frankfurter 
yo, phife, you remember that routine
that we used to make spiffy like mr. clean?
 um... um... a tidbit, um... a smidgen

tell your mother, tell your father, send a telegram
i'm like an energizer 'cause, you see, i last long
my crew is never ever wack because we stand strong
now if you say my style is wack that's where you're dead wrong
i slayed that buddy in el segundo then push it along
you'd be a fool to reply that phife is not the man
'cause you know and i know that you know who i am
a special shout of peace goes out to all my pals, you see
and a middle finger goes for all you punk mc's
'cause i love it when you wack mc's despise me
they get vexed, i roll next, can't none contest me
i'm just a fly mc who's five foot three and very brave
on top remaining, no home training 'cause i misbehave
i come correct in full effect have all my hoes in check
and before i get the butt, the jim must be erect
you see, my aura's positive i don't promote no junk
see, i'm far from a bully and i ain't a punk
extremity in rhythm, yeah that's what you heard
so just clean out your ears and just check the word

back in the days on the boulevard of linden
we used to kick routines and the presence was fittin'
it was i, the phifer  and me, the abstract 
 the rhymes were so rumpin' that the brothers rode the 'zack 
ayo tip, do you recall when we used to rock  what? 
those fly routines on your cousin's block?
 um, let me see, damn i can't remember 
 i receive the message and you will play the sender 
you on point tip?  all the time, phife 
you on point tip?  yeah, all the time, phife 
you on point tip?  yo, all the time, phife 
so play the resurrector and give the dead some life

okay, if knowledge is the key then just show me the lock
got the scrawny legs but i move just like lou brock
with speed, i'm agile plus i'm worth your while
one hundred percent intelligent black child
my optic presentation sizzles the retina
how far must you go to gain respect? umm...
well, it's kind of simple, just remain your own
or you'll be crazy, sad and alone
industry rule number four thousand and eighty;
record company people are shady
so kids watch your back 'cause i think they smoke crack
i don't doubt it, look at how they act
well off to better things like a hip hop forum
pass me the rock and i'll score 'em with decorum
and proper what you say hammer? proper
rap is not pop, if you call it that then stop

bonita applebum, remember way back woo
when you used to play your knickers and your pigtail 'do
i used to be all on it like a fly to shit
back in the days, bonita was a hit
i flirted and i flirted 'til there was no end
but you kicked the diabolical and said we was friends
honey, you was funny but i'm tired of that
it's three years later, i got a new rap
got a little older, a titbit wiser
i gained twenty pounds, six inches higher
speaking of high i saw you smoke a hootie mack
your ex boyfriend claims he gets the booty back
but i'm here to testify it'll be a hard try
slapping my knees, letting out sighs
want to keep it slamming like a hip hop song
bonita applebum, you gotta put me on

bonita applebum  hey hon, hey hon 
bonita applebum  go 'head with yourself 
bonita applebum  hey hon, hey hon 
bonita applebum, you gotta put me on

bonita applebum  hey hon, hey hon 
bonita, bonita, bonita, bonita, bonita
in the words of the immortal sweet daddy  uh 

i'll never shed a tear but then again i won't steer
you wrong, i steer you strong, for affection steer here
i'll take you to a place that's farther than the uno
what do you know, if we go to el segundo
your presence should be closer like on "buddy" i'll toast
to the ever clever youth, to say the least, you're the most
honey, you're my honey, a yo, dip, you're my dip
treasure and forever there'll be pleasure with tip
as we glide and move
cushioned like a pillow that's soft and smooth
ricky d said we got to "show and prove"
do it to the music, that's the raw butt groove
intimidate the boy
cupid that's his name
picking all us suckers is his flipping game
but tip don't fall for that
instead i'll get the natives and we rush to the latest
lambskin store, get a six pack of hats for

bonita applebum  hey hon, hey hon 
bonita applebum  go 'head with yourself 
bonita applebum  hey hon, hey hon 
bonita applebum, i said you gotta put me on
i said bonita applebum  hey hon, hey hon 
bonita applebum  go 'head with yourself 
bonita applebum  hey hon, hey hon

fu manchu'n cause i'm doing what just had to be done
now we in there like swimwear, girls calling me hon
give me hugs, little peck, mucho tongue, lots of sex
nuff respects to my bros that live on five six street  right

which is wild now i smile when i whip lash mcs with my style
call me cuckoo, i'm making buku bucks
i'm geared and fully prepared to tear all mcs that are schmuks
for bros who sleep and cavity creep and listen when i talk
as i soothe in the groove, 'cause i'm smooth like mr. rourke
doobely zoo mr. wu, no need to be rude but f.u
'cause i ain't got nothing to prove

now here i go, once again with the ill flow
other mcs that rap, their style is so so
phife dawg was never the type that ever lacked skills
i just stay true to my roots and then i get ill
twenty years of age but yet i still seek  knowledge 
and this year, was so called, my senior year in  college 
but i chose to pursue, in a field called music
and with some hype beats and breaks you know i won't refuse it
get on the board lay down the track and i'll do ten laps
pass the pen, pass the pad, and i'll kick nuff  raps 
just come inside your jam and witness who is boss
and it won't be tony danza nor diana ross
as small as i am, i still can pack jams
do a freestyle and step, but yet i still slam
not trying to say that no one can get with me
not only is it the lyrics i write, it's my delivery
name one rapper that you know who has this high strung voice
my name's malik and i'm unique, in other words top choice
nothing commercial 'bout this, it's mainly hardcore
now that you got what you want, do you want more
because i got more in store

la schmoove, yo we don't got nothing to prove
la schmoove, yo we don't got nothing to prove
la schmoove, yo we don't got nothing to prove

mc, the shining one, a.k.a. the golden child
i have a grin at times but then throw up a fake smile
vaseline intensive care, don't fear mon frere
sak pase, everybody that rappin', g pull his hair
back in the groove, it's no way you can handle this
shit so fly, that you can call it scandalous
'cause i manifest in, words that i'm preaching
unleashing you now seek the sounds that i'm teaching
i hear  not  see  not , knots to makes butts  rock 
i rides rhythm to the beginnin, then won't stop
the chinese son of sam, the skipper's peter pan
the rootinest tootinest cowboy in the east
releasing a new type of lyrical lingo
single, "the alarm", the girls cooties i will tingle
no expiration date, so you know i won't  expire 
no skippin a weekly check, so i don't have to  retire 
write, the ca pital, m.o
chip fu with the kung fu givin shouts on my show
ir regular styles is here too
tripped, boo boo, you first made a mistake
not alexander but considered to be great
great, but, like the grape ape
fake, the moves, and your ankles i will break
break or broken, the m.o., has spoken
movements on the slick, taking the train you need a token
i guess not, 'cause you pause for the cause
you either biting your nails, or start picking straws
holy mick i'm living large just like trunk jewels
nuff respects to many minds, ah owwwwee

to all the lowriders, and big riders
lowride, what happened in the car yo
f'real, let a nigga

brand new truck, butter soft seats
4 point something with a low ridin something
ain't nothing better than to ride out the hood with it
who looking better and damn you looking good in it
take a chance with a nigga in the choice ride
listen to the cd's i play inside
mos def, jay, prince and stevie
marvin gaye, led zeppelin and biggie
and when the evening is over, love
gonna find a nice spot for the rover, love
do things to make the man in the moon blush
my mind race but i tell my waist don't rush
you's a upper echelon piece
so when you find there's a stash then you don't freak
you wanna nibble on a nigga ear
and do all the things that make a nigga wanna get near
oh, i'm a queens representative
get wild by any means my incentive is
when we done, i start it up again
and ride round with you ,cause you my special friend

me and you i think we should ride
come on come on come on come on
don't worry just done get inside
come on come on come on come on

the second part, my ride is like art
we get creative in it when we take it out and spin it
the backseat is the canvas we painting on
abstract the word we creating on
the tv's in the back and the dash too
got miss napkins and bamboo
don't worry, the tints passed the legal one
outkast's banging loud in my eardrum
the way the wheels spin cutting through the still wind
outsiders looking in with the ill grin
fuel injected, brand new inspected
emissions got tested, details perfected
got the armor all touch, empty out the dutch
no tobacco spilling on my rug, klutz
kick off your shoes, show off your pedicure
shake off the blues, we all for getting more
more of that thing
stuff that brings ecstasy making you cling
a little harder than your average hug or grab
lady tell me this is better than taking a cab
and when you bounce, tell all your girls
you rode around hot wheeling, drinking, no earl
vacationing, v up my v8
just one night we drive and we escape

me and you i think we should ride
come on come on come on come on
don't worry just done get inside
come on come on come on come on
me and you i think we should ride
come on come on come on come on
don't worry just done get inside
come on come on come on come on

verse one: tash
caps get peeled rolling in my force field
like a nine with hollow points, i keep rap flows concealed
so when you walkin down the block you better watch who you approachin
 i'm not your r b singer  so ain't no need for vocal coachin
just a forty and a roach and i'll evict you out the units
while y'all niggas couldn't move me if you worked for starving students
downin all beer types, from st. ide's to red stripe  yipes  
the man that's stuffin mics down motherfuckers windpipes
has returrrrned, to burrrrn, it's time y'all niggas learrrrrn
i neutralize y'all niggas like relaxer in a perm
with flows that go against the grain with a story so compellin
i should mind the people's court, snatch the mic from doug llewellyn
and host my own show, after bill cosby comes ricooooo 
transmitting live to all my black people
catch my drift, i'm down with my nigga e swift
my name is tash, i'm from the group that you don't wanna fuck with
never shy, sippin on some why ask why
smokin thai with this bitch that's more fly than jasmine guy
hooked up with john q so let me do my thiiing
while niggas rock that played shit that they bought from chess king
but still, i train rhymes to flip like a seal
niggas say my rhyme skill on the steel is unreal
but all i do is chill and swing it when i bring it
oh shit, that's my nigga, show these niggas how you sing it
verse two: q tip
i bring it to your chest, pa, all the way live
we deliver ill verses guaranteed to cause hives
when we start rappin, heads roll like patton
what the fuck bloodclot, the alkaholiks rhyme a lot
yo i'm like grimace when i'm on this rap scrimmage
and i got this magic wand to make your puny soul diminish
the abstract delivers, i be the queens nigga on point
mary jane ain't nuttin but a joint
they called a nigga up to add a little bit of flavor
now i'm cuttin and slashin like luke's light saber
yeah, what? you trapped in the zone
where mc's get seared and your spot s blown
and in this rap shit a nigga need to be thicky
i fuck with the crew who downs the deuce deuce mickey's
i'm from the rotten apple, y'all niggas can't grapple
and love to the liks, hit your ass like a tackle
[tash: pow, bust my liquid ass style
peace to madlib and my nigga wildchild]
 tha alkaholiks  
 king tee  
 it s tha liks  
 the abstract  
 tha alkaholiks  
 king tee  
verse three: j ro
yo, put in the disc, e
while i hit the whiskey
the nigga missed me
i'm in this rap game so i'mma aim to be best
it's fresh, but off the head it's like the dunk contest
i don't walk the street, i roll my jeep in an instant
i rock the beat to sleep like an infant
the likwit crew, comin like this on you
with that four minute olde english piss on you
you're bustin dumb raps off the cap, oh shit
but i got the pen and pad locked down like a pit
i let the ink submerge into the thin wood sheets
beats make my head bop, so i'mma rock it for the streets
i fill all my days with big butts and boom
i let my pants hand cause my big nuts need room
i'm not old school, or new school, i'm out of school, i'm ditchin
when my girl starts bitchin i gets hot like a kitchen
i fly down like the chi town wind
 cause i got the iller noise to make the hardcore grin
when, the saints come marchin in
i'mma roll right by  em in the fly lincoln
roughneck niggas wanna box me down
 cause i got the ladies lookin like foxy brown
tha liks bring the beer, tip sticks it in your earholes
i drop the mic and strike the heisman pose
 it s tha liks

verse four: king tee
hardcore g, i get hardcore man
from the underland a fuckin wonderman, bam
lunatic potential, an isperential differential
confidentially smashin instrumentals
on this tune i bring raps of doom to the mic
and put my rare shit in flight, peep
if the drunk funk don't wanna hump in your trunk
man you got some motherfuckin junk

we can get down, we can we can get down  repeat x8 
it's like that man, it's like that  yes    repeat x4 
check it 

i'm not your average mc with the joe schmoe flow
if you don't know me by now, you'll never know
stepping on my critics, beating on my foes
the plan is to stay focused, only then i can grow
straight from the heart, i represent hip hop
i be three albums deep, but i don't wanna go pop
too many candy rappers seem to be at the top
too much candy is no good, so now i'm closing the shop
crushing competition like italians on grapes
my rhymes styles be blending like a ron g tape
my man where ya going, you can't escape
when the tribe is in the house that means nobody is safe
how can a reverend preach, when a rev can't define
the music of our youth from 1979
we rap by what we see, meaning reality
from people busting caps and like mandela being free
not every mc be with the negativity
we have a slew of rappers pushing positivity
hip hop will never die yo, it's all about the rap
so mayor barry smoking crack, let's preach about that
the trash you talk won't matter, that old bogus chatter
the more that you condemn us, it only makes us phatter
when i talk, i know i'm talking for hip hoppers all around
you know you love the sound, we gets down


i'm the cherry on the top of yo ice cream
i'm the mystic thought inside your dream
listen to the way we pulsate the jam
i'm the nigga here with the mic in hand
styles that we present are just a few
to do away with you and your hum drum crew
this is '93 and the shit is real
black people unite and put down your steel
ladies make a forum on your sexual drive
devote it to your lover and make it thrive
the rhythm's in f, i'm a hip hop body
release my energy with the force of a shotty
standing on the wall with my polo on
talking to the girl with the liz claiborne
keep the poetry in my black knapsack
got my timbo hooves and my doublemint pack
hit the city streets to enhance my soul
i can kick a rhyme over ill drum rolls
with a kick, snare, kicks and high hat
skilled in the trade of that old boom bap
i can do a trick with the opposite breed
i used to down 40s and smoke grade weed
now, i'm doing shows with half loot down
now it's time for me to take ya uptown
it's like that man, it's like that  yes    7x 
it's like this, shaheed 
shaheed: scratching  until end 
rakim: "why waste time on the microphone"

a tribe called quest consists of four members:
phife dawg, ali shaheed muhammad, q tip, and jarobi
a e i o u and sometimes y


i hope that you're the one
if not, you are the prototype

being the only bastard in a box logo casket
rashes on my dick from licks of shishkabob sagets
in some kanye west glasses screaming out "fuck faggots"
catch me in my attic taking photos of my dad's dick
drop the beat here to make it extra climactic

what the fuck?
i... i'm speechless, that was... fuck
shit, tyler, you're gonna need some help

blowing woofers and tweeters, shaking syllable meters
disaster's cataclysmic, mystic natural, it's about time
we hit you with some substance that's actual
i got a gift call, hip hop prophecy
since 2003 ends the reign of the jiggy mc
no more roaming on this planet like scavengers
scientists broke the code of the gregorian calendar
defying laws of space and time, trying to trace my lines
hold up, respect the architect
digital roland, my whole crew roll with vs
type to master this whole universe in three steps
we stretch across the equator with something major
universal rhyme tones, tamper with ya timezone
minds blown by the millions just for the feeling
hip hop, it just don't stop until i make a killing
nah i'm kidding, but for real
the world ain't the same no more
take your life to next level or remain no more
take your life to next level or remain no more
word up, word up

well i'm colliding with the mind of a
survivor surviving, uncover the time brother
the high volume wide column, height slalom
preferred jog on the side
dodgin' mirages, conquer the vibe, hunger lurks
nine to five work saga, god bless the life
father trife, travel to light
balance the globe off life, vocal pimpin' it's throat
so you know how we go down yo
struggle in the ghetto yo
metal throat, settle the dough, live showbiz

fascist through the atlas, first class diplomatic status
stagma flag, then overstanding the plan
bar scan, identify camera shots
streets watch, timex clocks
punch lunch on the dot, five minutes to rock
so we blue block cruise, it's old news how we do...

i'm a drop one rhyme, for every time i cross the thin line
between yours and mine, see, it's part of my design
shifting paradigm, yin and yang combined, must be out ya mind
thinking stahhr would never shine
props due, focus with a hawk's eye view
i'm all that, a plantain, and some ital stew
gettin' spinach, british, atl to venice
even abercrombie figures open off of this verb elixir
magnetic attraction,  raw as millie jackson
straight open in the caption, here comes the hix and braxton's
lyrical contraction, delivery reaction, it started with a passion, that's just the way it happened
born with umbilical cords strapped to korgs
won't drop a kurzweil plus those zip disk files?
sharp with the needles, found no iv's for the feeble
y'all fiending for the sequel and the beat's not even eq'd....

something sinister to it, pendulum swinging slow
a degenerate moving through the city with criminals, stealth
welcome to enemy turf, harder than immigrants work
"golf" is stitched into my shirt
get up off the pavement, brush the dirt up off my psyche
psyche, psyche

can i get that, oh  let me get that beat in my headphones, louder

it's probably been 12 years since my father left, left me fatherless
and i just used to say i hate him in dishonest jest
when honestly i miss this nigga, like when i was six
and every time i got the chance to say it i would swallow it
sixteen, i'm hollow, intolerant, skip shots
i storm that whole bottle, i'll show you a role model
i'm drunk, pissy, pissing on somebody front lawn
trying to figure out how and when the fuck i missed moderate
momma often was offering peace offerings
think, wheeze cough, scoffing and he's off again
searching for a big brother, tyler was that
and plus he liked how i rap, the blunted mice in the trap
too black for the white kids, and too white for the blacks
from honor roll to cracking locks up off them bicycle racks
i'm indecisive, i'm scatterbrained, and i'm frightened, it's evident
in them eyes, where he hiding all them icicles at?

uh  time lapse, bars rotten, heart's bottomless pit
was mobbin' deep as '96 havoc and prodigy did
we were the pottymouth posse crash the party and dip
with all belongings then toss em out to the audience
nothing was fucking awesome, trying to make it from the bottom of syd's
feeling as hard as vince carter's knee cartilage is
supreme garment and weed gardeners garnishing spliffs
with keef particles and entering apartments with 'zine article
tolerance for boundaries, i know you happy now
craven and these complex fuck niggas done track me down
just to be the guys that did it, like, "i like attention"
not the type where niggas trying to get a raise at my expense
supposed to be grateful, right? like, "thanks so much, you made my life
harder, and the ties between my mom and i are strained and tightened
even more than they were before all of this shit"
been back a week and i already feel like calling it quits

out of the ruins
out from the wreckage
can't make the same mistake this time
we are the children, the last generation
we are the ones they left behind
and, i wonder when we are ever gonna change
living under the fear, until nothing else remains

we don't need another hero
we don't need to know the way home
all we want is life beyond
thunderdome

looking for something we can rely on
there's gotta be something better out there
love and compassion
their day is coming
all else are castles built in the air
and i wonder when we are ever gonna change
living under the fear until nothing else remains

all the children say
we don't need another hero
we don't need to know the way home
all we want is life beyond
thunderdome

so, what do we do with our lives
we leave only a mark
will our story shine like a light
or end in the dark
give it all or nothing

we don't need another hero
we don't need to know the way home
all we want is life beyond
thunderdome


friends ‎  how many of us have them?
friends ‎  ones we can depend on
friends ‎  how many of us have them?
friends ‎  before we go any further, let's be
friends

is a word we use everyday
most the time we use it in the wrong way
now you can look the word up, again and again
but the dictionary doesn't know the meaning of friends
and if you ask me, you know, i couldn't be much help
because a friend's somebody you judge for yourself
some are ok, and they treat you real cool
but some mistake your kindness for bein' a fool
we like to be with some, because they're funny
others come around when they need some money
some you grew up with, around the way
and you're still real close to this very day
homeboys through the summer, winter, spring and fall
and then there's some we wish we never knew at all
and this list goes on, again and again
but these are the people that we call friends

when we first went out together, we barely knew each other
we had no intentions, on becoming lovers
but in no time at all, you became my girl
me and you, one on one, against the world
talkin on the telephone for hours at a time
or else i was at your house, or you was at mine
and then came the arguments and all kinds of problems
besides making love, we had nothing in common
it could've lasted longer because it started out strong
but i guess we went about the whole thing wrong
'cause out of nowhere it just came to an end
because we became lovers before we were friends

friends ‎  how many of us have them?
friends ‎  ones we can depend on
friends ‎  how many of us have them?
friends ‎  before we go any further, let's be
friends

you say you and your girlfriend were so tight
you took her out with you and your guy one night
she even had a set of keys to your home
and you shared mostly everything you owned
but as she shook your hand, she stole your man
and it was done so sweet, it had to be a plan
couldn't trust her with cheese, let alone your keys
with friends like that you don't need enemies
you wonder how long it was all going on
and you re still not sure if you re glad he s gone
you say, well if she took him he was never mine
but deep inside you know that's just another lie
and now you're kinda cold toward people you meet
'cause of something that was done to you by some creep
but nevertheless, i'll say it again
that these are the people that we call friends

friends ‎  how many of us have them?
friends ‎  ones we can depend on
friends ‎  how many of us have them?
friends ‎  before we go any further, let's be
friends

"boogie down was performing, hey they ain't no joke"
"down with the sound called b d p"

back in the days i knew rap would never die
i used to listen to awesome 2 on whbi
i used to hear all kind of rap groups before sampling loops
rappers wore bell bottom lee suits
me and kenny couldn't afford that
so we would go to the park when they was jammin' to hear rap
i used to listen till the cops broke it up
i always thought to myself "damn, why they fucked it up?"
but nevertheless i was in love with the microphone
and it stayed that way until i left home
on the streets of new york, now i'm free
but with freedom comes big responsibility
i used to walk around driven by the force
i remember how large super rhymes was when he fell off
i used to wonder about crews that used to rock
they were large, but none of them could manage to stay on top

do you ever think about when you outta here?
record deal and video outta here?
mercedes benz and range rover outta here?
no doubt bdp is old school, but we ain't goin' out 

after livin' on the streets alone
some years went by, i signed myself into a group home
i used to watch the show "i dream of jeannie"
and dreamt about "when will i be large like whodini?"
but i was messin' with graffiti on the subway
and gettin' chased by the cops almost everyday
i knew it had to bea better way see
so i would go to my room, blast run dmc
around 1984 i left the group home, again alone
still dreamin' about the microphone
gimme a chance man, i know i can rock it
but i had to worry about puttin' money in my pocket
so when i reached the shelter i met my helper dj scott la rock
and we both loved hip hop
i was takin' suckas out in the shelter system
yeah there was rappers in the shelter but i had to diss 'em
but all along, my vision was never lost
i kept seeing all these rap groups fallin' off

do you ever think about when you're outta here?
fly girl and fresh gear outta here?
five thousand dollar love seat outta here?
no doubt bdp is old school, but we ain't goin' out 

while i'm battling these rival crews
yes, bdp would stay in the street news
some said, all they wanna do is battle
they can't write a song, so their careers won't last long 
around this time i used to hang with ced gee
and dj scott la rock used to buy gold with eric b
i didn't meet rakim till later with scott
i remember we were jammin' at the rooftop
it used to irk me when these critics had opinions
scott would say "just keep rappin', i'll keep spinnin'"
we had a fucked up contract, but we signed it
and dropped the hip hop album criminal minded
we told the critics your opinions are bull
same time eric b and rakim dropped paid in full
hip hop pioneers we didn't ask to be
but right then hip hop changed drastically
people didn't wanna hear the old rap sound
we started samplin' beats by james brown
in the middle of doin' "my philosophy"
scott was killed and that shit got to me
but knowin' the laws of life and death
i knew his breath, was one with my breath
i had nothin' left and it was scary
so i dropped by all means necessary
another hip hop group that was a friend of me
was a revolution crew called public enemy
it takes a nation of millions to hold us back
these two albums set off consciousness in rap
but all along, i'm still lookin' around
and all i can see are these rap groups fallin' down

do you ever think about when you outta here?
condominium and beach house outta here?
credit cards and bank accounts outta here?
no doubt bdp is old school, be we ain't goin' out 


don't, don't play with her, don't be dishonest  ayy 
still not understandin' this logic  ayy 
i'm back and i'm better  and i'm better 
i want you bad as ever
don't let me just let up
i wanna give you better
baby, it's whatever
somebody gotta step up
girl, i'm that somebody, so i'm next up
be damned if i let him catch up
it's easy to see that you're fed up
i am on a whole 'nother level
girl, he only fucked you over cause you let him
fuck him, girl, i guess he didn't know any better
girl, that man didn't show any effort
do all i can just to show you you're special
certain it's your love that holds me together
lately you say he been killin' the vibe
gotta be sick of this guy
pull up, skrr, get in the ride
left hand is steerin' the other is grippin' your thigh
light up a spliff and get high
shawty, you deserve what you've been missin'
lookin' at you i'm thinkin' he must be trippin'
play this song for him, tell him, "just listen"

don't
don't

girl, said he keeps on playin' games
and his lovin' ain't the same
i don't know what to say, but
what a shame
if you were mine you would not get the same
if you were mine you would top everything
suicide in the drop switchin' lanes
and that thing so fire, baby, no propane
got good pussy, girl, can i be frank?
to keep it one hundred, girl, i ain't no saint
but he the only reason that i'm feelin' this way
givin' you the world, baby, when you get space
pen game get me laid, baby, that's penetrate
oh baby

don't

h town got me feelin' so throwed

missing you
is nothing like i thought it'd be
it's harder, baby
and loving you
is great but sometimes we just have to move on
yeah
know i keep my head held high
i still get choked up inside
at the thought of you
i try so hard to be strong
but it's hard to carry on without you
yeah
but i'm okay
i'm on a rise
nothing's gonna stop me from gettin' it
but i'm okay
i'm on a rise
nothing's gonna stop me from gettin' it

ask a nigga in my hood, he go and said it on stand
and when them situations came, i came out like a champ
when it was pourin' down rain and i came out of it damp
but now it's champagne showers when we poppin' the champ', ugh

niggas can't be us 'cause they rats
stand tall, point a finger, never that
i knew a nigga had it all, went to the b, ain't get it back
that's why i'm humble as ever, and i rumble whatever
don't chase hoes 'cause they come with this cheddar
i seen my man girl start actin' bougie when he fuck up his cheddar
before you knew it, niggas was fuckin' her better
i knew about it and i 
wanted to tell him, i felt funny as ever
but when i told him, he went runnin' to tell her, damn
remember i was down bad, i'm talkin' under the cellar
now the rolls royces come with umbrellas
for the rain and all the pain that we been through
if you don't feed your wolves they gon' put you on the menu
that's why i be with family and some bulls that i been knew
if money determined loyalty, we'd cut you with a ginsu
now i go against you, facts

rule number one, never count your homie pockets thinkin' you deserve it
rule number two, never trust a bitch that'll fuck you for some purses
rule number three, save you some of that money, shit you better stop splurgin'
'cause when it's all said and done and you back at the bottom, they gon' treat you like you worthless
respect the game

fuck the fame
we millionaires fuck your watch and lil' chain
niggas disappear as quick as lil zane
you feelin' yourself, i know you got a lil' lane
just hold your composure, i seen this shit happen over and over
that couple hundred thousand holdin' you over
that ain't real money
that's bill money, buy a rollie, get a wheel money
catch a case, pay a lawyer, take a deal money
now you tapped out and got no appeal money
callin' home like niggas done did you wrong
but when you had that money you could've put niggas on
and the moment they put cuffs on you, your bitch was gone
student of the game, i'm just ahead of my class
i'm that nigga, but i never got my head up my ass
you doin' good, but i'm ready for bad
and you won't never catch me frontin' 'cause i'm used to bein' second to last
respect the game

rule number one, never count your homie pockets thinkin' you deserve it
rule number two, never trust a bitch that'll fuck you for some purses
rule number three, save you some of that money, shit you better stop splurgin'
'cause when it's all said and done and you back at the bottom, they gon' treat you like you worthless
respect the game

tell me lord, can you help me?
 i said lord, can you help me? 

this just the way i feel
mind's been racing so long, yeah
it's just no way to deal
with these problems alone

and i really can't take it no more
i've been fighting temptations, my lord
i'm making them restless
 i said, lord can you help me? 
i never felt selfish before
i've been living so reckless, i know
tell me lord, can you help me?
 i said lord, can you help me? 

do not stop
we are black people and we shouldn't have to feel like this
we shouldn't have to protest because you are treating us wrong
we do this because we need to and we have rights

falling outta harmony, be singing different melodies

smooth it out now 


move over bacon there's something meatier
a natural born lover with love to give free to ya
meatier, so all you bacon lovers move over
cause i'm so smooth they should call me blackanova
i'm not tryin' to say that i'm number one
i'm just a smooth operator that gets the job done
so, let me lick you from head to toe
realllllllll slowwwwwwwww
cause ever since i was young i could keep girls sprung
just by the movement of my tongue
i remember it all started way back
in ummm... kindergarten  
some played with legos, some played with play doh
but i was feelin' girls like a ripe tomato
and now it's 1990 and you can find me as i dunk
lockin' up girls like i want
yes i got a harem, but i don't share em
i collect em like per diem and mmm, you gotta see em
because the ladies is all i dream of
and not even anita baker can give sweeter love
you know why?
cause i can do it right  4x 
yesssss i can 

step up girls and get somethin' to treasure
and welcome to the smooth operator's palace of pleasure
and if you're wondering if i want it   
i got a craftmatic with your name written on it
i reminisce saying i take em eight to eighty
but i was just kiddin', no you have to be a lady
even if you're too young, with the hypest body
i just don't go to a similac party
so all those of age, we can get intimate
bumper to bumper, so you can get your fender bent
i treat girls just like pastry
mmmmmmmmm  smacks lips  tasty 
very kinky when it comes to hanky panky
a well known player, but not for the yankees
i won't say i'm the baddest or portray that role
but i'm of the top two, and my father's gettin' old
i'm taking love to a brand new height
and if loving girls is wrong i don't wanna be right
cause my man babyface said that it's no crime
and of course i'll work diana ross overtime
you know why?
cause i can do it right  4x 
yesssss i can 

if i was on the movies i'd frame roger rabbit
play spike lee with jessica, because she's gotta have it
but i'm not an actor, i'm just a mack
that charms girls as i whisper sweet nothings to attract her
and bring about that feeling of passion
to have her on my body like modern day fashion
layin' next to me, in pure ecstasy
you're like a door and you know that sex the key
so send your man to the lost and found
i'm bringing something that's world renowned
in other words   good lovin' that's major
i got girls in more areas than a skypager
running around saying, "please me, please me, please me"
that's why i say it ain't easy
but i've been able to maintain my status
with ladies macking without if's, and's, or maybe's
and other players just can't understand it
and couldn't keep they girls even if they were branded
i always end up with them on my shelf
 smack  i gotta jump back and kiss myself
you know why?
cause i can do it right  4x 
yesssss i can 


i sit alone in my four cornered room
starin' at candles
oh, that shit is on?
let me drop some shit like this here, real smooth

at night i can't sleep, i toss and turn
candlesticks in the dark, visions of bodies bein' burned
four walls just starin' at a nigga
i'm paranoid, sleepin' with my finger on the trigger
my mother's always stressin' i ain't livin' right
but i ain't goin' out without a fight
see, every time my eyes close
i start sweatin' and blood starts comin' out my nose
it's somebody watchin' the ak'
but i don't know who it is, so i'm watchin' my back
i can see him when i'm deep in the covers
when i awake i don't see the motherfucker
he owns a black hat like i own
a black suit and a cane like my own
some might say, "take a chill, b."
but fuck that shit  there's a nigga tryin' to kill me
i'm poppin' in the clip when the wind blows
every 20 seconds got me peepin' out my window
investigatin' the joint for traps
checkin' my telephone for taps
i'm starin' at the woman on the corner
it's fucked up when your mind's playin' tricks on ya

i make big money, i drive big cars
everybody know me; it's like i'm a movie star
but late at night, somethin' ain't right
i feel i'm bein' tailed by the same sucker's headlights
is it that fool that i ran off the block?
or is it that nigga last week that i shot?
or is it the one i beat for 5000 dollars?
thought he had 'caine, but it was gold medal flour
reached under my seat, grabbed my popper for the suckers
ain't no use to me lyin'
i was scareder than a motherfucker
hooked a left into popeye's and bailed out quick
if it's goin' down, let's get this shit over with
here they come just like i figured
i got my hand on the motherfuckin' trigger
what i saw'll make your ass start gigglin'
three blind, crippled and crazy senior citizens
i live by the sword
i take my boys everywhere i go, because i'm paranoid
i keep lookin' over my shoulder
and peepin' around corners; my mind is playin' tricks on me

day by day it's more impossible to cope
i feel like i'm the one that's doin' dope
can't keep a steady hand, because i'm nervous
every sunday morning i'm in service
prayin' for forgiveness
and tryin' to find an exit out the business
i know the lord is lookin' at me
but yet and still it's hard for me to feel happy
i often drift when i drive
havin' fatal thoughts of suicide
bang and get it over with
and then i'm worry free, but that's bullshit
i got a little boy to look after
and if i die, then my child'll be a bastard
i had a woman down with me
but to me it seemed like she was down to get me
she helped me out in this shit
but to me she was just another bitch
now she's back with her mother
now i'm realizing that i love her
now i'm feelin' lonely
my mind is playin' tricks on me

this year halloween fell on a weekend
me and geto boys are trick or treatin'
robbin' little kids for bags
'til a law man got behind our ass
so we speeded up the pace
took a look back and he was right before our face
he'd be in for a squabble, no doubt
so i swung and hit the nigga in his mouth
he was goin' down we figured
but this wasn't no ordinary nigga
he stood about six or seven feet
now that's the nigga i be seein' in my sleep
so we triple teamed on him
droppin' them motherfuckin' b's on him
the more i swung, the more blood flew
then he disappeared and my boys disappeared too
then i felt just like a fiend
it wasn't even close to halloween
it was dark as fuck on the streets
my hands were all bloody from punchin' on the concrete
goddamn, homie 
my mind is playin' tricks on me

believe that 
what i don't understand is when lootpack steps in the jam
brothers wanna bob their head but somehow cannot slam
sometimes i can relate, but i cannot take
paying ten dollars just to watch no one participate
i think to myself, "lootpack, make that crowd lift
make that crowd jump up to your surround gift"
but before i bust a mic check this loud teen
attempts to pick pocket the mic from jack in front of the scene
as i come with frustration and coordination
my crew gets in attack formation and takes 'em out

o.p.p., how can i explain it? i'll take it, frame by frame it
to have y'all all jumpin', shoutin', sayin' it
o is for "other," p is for "peoples'," scratch your temple
the last p, well, that's not that simple
it's sort of like, well, another way to call a cat a kitten
it's five little letters that are missin' here
you get on occasion if the other party isn't gamin'
it seems i gotta start the explainin', bust it
you ever had a girl and met her on a nice hello
you get her name and number
and then left feelin' real mellow
you get home, wait a day
she's what you wanna know about, then you call up
and it s her girlfriend s or her cousin s house? 
it s not a front, a f to the r to the o to the n to the t;
it's just her boyfriend's at her house
 oh, that s why she s scary 
it's o.p.p., time other people's what you get it
there's no room for relationship, there's just room to hit it
how many brothers out there know just what i'm gettin' at
who think it's wrong 'cause i was splittin' and co hittin' that
well, if you do, that's o.p.p. and you're not down with it
but if you don't, here's your membership

you down with o.p.p.?  yeah, you know me  
you down with o.p.p.?  yeah, you know me

you down with o.p.p.?  yeah, you know me  
who s down with o.p.p.?  all the homies  

well, for the ladies o.p.p. means somethin' gifted
the first two letters' the same
but the last is somethin' different
it's the longest, loveliest, lean, i call it the leanest
it's another five letter word
rhymin' with "cleanness" or "meanness"
i won't get into that, i'll do it ah sorta properly
i'll say the last p, hmmm, stands for "property"
now lady, here comes a kiss
blow a kiss back to me, now tell me exactly
have you ever known a brother
who had another, like, a girl or wife
and you just had to stop a toast
'cause he looked just that nice?
you looked at him, he looked at you
and you knew right away
he had someone but he was gonna be yours anyway 
you couldn't be seen with him at all and still you didn't care
'cause in a room behind a door no one but y'all are there
when y'all are finished, y'all can leave
and only y'all would know; and then y'all could throw that skeleton bone right in the closet do'
now don't be shy
'cause if you're down i want your hands up high
say o.p.p.  o.p.p.   i like to say with pride
now when you do it, do it well and make sure that it counts
you're now down with a discount

you down with o.p.p.?  yeah, you know me  
you down with o.p.p.?  yeah, you know me  
you down with o.p.p.?  yeah, you know me

spokesman of the precious few
i represent the views of independent youth
that wrestle nail and tooth to evade neckties and suits
cause truthfully a nine to nine's a waste of time
plus a waste of mind, so i blaze a dime
tryna find creative ways to escape the grind
i gotta take what's mine in this land of milk and honey
filled with money, still hungry and won't finish
till i fill my tummy, grill me or love me
my passion is unbridled, when idol crafted recitals
they can't lose like magic or michael, pick or choose
not only dropping knowledge but slamming and dishing jewels
navigate with slicker moves, through the gritty city i cruise
confused what to do with my life, but got my sights set on the apex
it's a safe bet that i ain't taking no for an answer
this quest for dough is like a cancer
spreading over body parts, especially my mind and heart
time to start the relentless pursuit so i can make my mark
on this planet, granted i meant it, see saw mechanics
from circumstances that only causing confidence damage
planet firmly i'm standing on the outskirts of the average
relishing the challenger till the day my spirit vanish
man this life is tough and i've had enough, my tank's on empty
valleys are plenty, but from the top they can't prevent me
the rotten apple, it tempts me, locked in the grapple at lensy
time to take stock and watch how far determined they should get me

everybody across the world better get your hustle on
out in the street, move your feet before your money's gone
mama can't sleep and baby need clothes
i gotta make my moves so i got some
mama can't sleep and baby need clothes
i gotta make my moves so i got some
yeah, yeah

stress should hear me, never any rest for the weary
try to progress, at best i eat, sleep barely
the future is scary and so i proceed to look for solid ground
but difficult because i'm always in and out of town
weigh by the pound, not in a duffle
i bear a bigger burden on my back that go beyond the strength of muscle
the hustle and bustle, trying to figure out the puzzle
of how to triumph amongst the troubles sent to bust your bubble
trust i'm accustomed with the everyday
i wonder will my stress will ever decay, looking for a better way
ahead of the days of a bigger mission, sealing my vision
c.a.l.i.b.e.r. living and bringing it to fruition
lord if you listen, i'm only asking for the strength
to bask in the paper after laboring for such length
it's like an eternity with much ahead
i hope of every second i invested, i'm collecting at the end


just do it, just do it
just do it, do it, do it
just do it, just do it
just do it, do it, do it
we gotta hustle y'all, right now y'all
we gotta hustle y'all, right now y'all
we gotta hustle y'all, right now y'all
we gotta hustle y'all, right now y'all

try to find what you can get
but all they dish you up is shit

look around, we're folding earth
try to find out what it's worth
what it s worth, worth
what it s, what it s worth

time and time what i m working for
is it worth it, though?
look at fam realize what i m working towards
keep they pockets filled with stacks
gotta keep food up in they fridge
keep my moms up out of that trap
keep my bro up out of that pen
never had a land in hand, always had to play my part
play it smart
artist about his craft
but sometimes survival is bigger than art
yo, this life is bigger than me, feel weighed down by a hundred boulders
got family on my hands, crown on my head, city on top of my shoulders
fuck what these niggas say, fuck what these niggas think
it ain t worth the time
when you got fans with they hands in the air
making sure you don't gotta work a regular job on a regular
you got niggas tryna live they dream
but you got niggas that live the reality, not tryna live above they means
this what, this kinda life i dream
two shots to the head, two shots till we dead
just what this kind of life might bring
that s what this kinda night might mean
you clock in or be glocked in, ogs here, no stopping
as long as breath s in my lungs waving white flags ain t never the option


i see i m talking and debating about my rating
if i only had one fan rating me high i could never feel underrated
so i hear too many questions about
why you not working, when the latest out
never was one to go to another one just to feel validated  bout
shit i m doing, all around the world
tryina give  em what they asking for
yeah, i m good from the borough all the way to euro
hood pass with a passport
hit a toenail, go back to the mo
but it sound like we re raised around criminals just to hear shots outside of the door
give a fuck less about shots and subliminals
so so so so
let it breathe, let it doze
me and my niggas had dreams, cashing checks with seven os
pa, westside, hop in the truck like let s ride
mom s looking at the time, hoping that her oldest son make it back inside
and i did that, live by a code, live for tomorrow
walk down streets where empty hollows stray, sidewalks where broken bottles lay
i did that, went from boom bap in the day, go rap round the neck
double track and the deck, lay it back on cassette
yeah, yeah, they lived that

what you think


used to draw
hard to admit that i used to draw
portraiture and the human form
doodle of a two headed unicorn
it was soothin', movin' his arm in a fusion
of man made tools and a muse from beyond
even if it went beautifully wrong
it was tangible truth for a youth who refused to belong
no name nuisance, stews in a bedroom
oozing a brand new cuneiform
barely commune with the horde
got a whole gray scale ungluing his world
might zone out to the yap of the magpie
unseen hand dragging his graphite
cross contour, little bit of backlight
black ink after a bristol to baptize
you can't imagine the rush that ensue
when you get three dimensions stuffed into two
then it's off to a school where it's all that you do
being trained and observed by a capable few
back in new york, five peeps and a dog
in a two bedroom doing menial jobs
plus, rhymin' and stealin' and being a clod
distractions free to maraud
i left some years a deer in the light
i left some will to spirit away
i let my fears materialize
i let my skills deteriorate
haunted by the thought of what i should have been continuing
a mission that was rooted in a 20 year affinity
in rickety condition with an id crisis
nap on the front lawn, look up in the sky, it's 

shapes falling out of the fringe
all heart, though we would've made cowardly kings
they will chop you down just to count your rings
just to count your rings, just to count your rings
and there were colors pouring out of the fringe
all heart, though we would've made cowardly kings
they will chop you down just to count your rings
just to count your rings, just to count your rings

used to paint
hard to admit that i used to paint
natural light on a human face
stenciled fire on his roommate's bass
it was blooming addiction
amiss in the pushing of pigment
book like a tattooed pigskin, look
pinhead kids of the minute
drank kool aid from a tube of acrylic
and it grew up into linseed oil over linen
joy to the poison, voice of the resin
capture a map of the gesture
back up, add a little accurate fat to the figure
redo that, move that inward
zinc white lightning shoots from his fingers
studio strewn with illusion and tinctures
stay tuned for the spooky adventures
you can't imagine the stars that align
when a forearm starts foreshortening right
or a torso hung on a warping spine
in proportion reads as warm and alive
routine day with a dirt cheap brush
then a week goes by and it goes untouched
then two, then three, then a month
and the rest of your life, you beat yourself up
i left some seasons eager to fall
i left some work to bury alive
i let my means of being dissolve
i let my person curl up and die
eating up his innards, an unfeasible anxiety
has brutally committed to relinquishing his privacy
aligning with the trials of the anti midas
nap on the back lawn, look up in the sky, it's 

shapes falling out of the fringe
all heart, though we would've made cowardly kings
they will chop you down just to count your rings
just to count your rings, just to count your rings
and there were colors pouring out of the fringe
all heart, though we would've made cowardly kings
they will chop you down just to count your rings
just to count your rings, just to count your rings

i'm blowed and i'm liquored up, i've been told that i'm cold as a winter month
and i showed i can explode when it sickens up, bloaw
i'm back on the style, let me pick it up
did you predict that what i spit on this hit is ridiculous
i should tip my pimping cup
just for pitching up percent of a pigeons rent
given for living expense at the stripping club


don't let me catch you slipping up your numbers up
give and duck, or run a muck
attempt a jump like double dutch, the clips'll bust
your clique is just sick of us
bringing the heat steaming me swinging defeat
you street, dreaming on sleep, idiots?
el, the sickest you ever heard
and predicting a set of words
that he stick in the head of nerds
or just gifted with lady curve and positions written to say something
gotta stay buzzing coming off on the line like a fadeaway dr. j jumping

cu zin, we got the streets buz zin
villa blowing, bubb ling
those who ain't caught on, fill em'...in
we in this grizzie now and we playing to win



feels like that warm summer night
like when everything was going right
it's a beautiful love song haunting your mind
forever be this way
she has to concentrate
a painted face to hide the other person
whose tired and used
but she still has that shit on her nose

spiraling, spiraling
spiraling, out of control
no one, no one
no one ever can know
 she's coming to get you 
spiraling, spiraling
 she's looking to get you 
out of control
no one  she's going to catch you  no one
no one   she's still gonna catch you  ever can know

now she's standing in the pouring night
but the light she sees is out of sight
like a beautiful love song haunting the mind
forever in the chase

you know that i fuck too
i'm ashamed, i'm ashamed
but misery loves company
you know that song, oh what's the number
here we go again

spiraling, spiraling
spiraling, out of control
no one  she's going to get you  no one
no one  she's still gonna get you  ever can know


so if the role, so if the role don't fit me
got to be moving on

i could be a typical kinda girl
wasting my time
that ain't my style
see i would rather be occupied
always tryna keep my mind
pointing to a higher place
i can have anything i want
anything i can dream of
i've been told from the day i was born
so i make sure everyday
that i don't let nothing hold me back
got to be on track
i gotta move

so if the role don't fit me
got to be moving on
cause if it don't work for me
guess i'll be moving on

hey i could take liberty
but that would cause me a change
and that ain't my thang
cause i don't wanna stand with the crowd
only true to myself
don't have a follow to no one else
not trying to be alone
but if the fact doing wrong
got no problem leaving the room
don't feel no sympathy
at least not for me
cause i know just what i am gonna do
i gotta move
 2x 
so if the role don't fit me
got to be moving on
cause if it don't work for me
guess i'll be moving on
keep moving  7x 
on   on and on
 2x 
keep moving
keep moving
keep moving
on   on

so if the role don't fit me
got to be moving on
cause if it don't work for me
guess i'll be moving on
 2x during chorus 
keep moving
keep moving
keep moving
on   on

on the east side that you rented
little two flat, inexpensive
i didn't have a glove to pitch in

outkast bumping up and down the street
slantback, cadillac, 'bout 5 niggas deep
75 mc's freestyling to the beat

should have bought an ounce, but you copped a dub
should have held back, but you throwed a punch
supposed to meet your girl but you packed a lunch
no d to the u to the g for you
got a son on the way by the name of bamboo
got a little baby girl four year, jordan
never turn my back on my kids for them
should have hit it, quit it, rag top
before you re up, get a laptop
make a business for yourself, boy, set some goals
make a fat diamond out of dusty coals
record number four, but we on a roll
hold up, slow up, stop, "control"
like janet, plan it, stankonia's on ya
moving like floyd, coming straight to florida
lock all your windows then block the corridors
pulling off a belt 'cause a whipping's in order
like a three piece fish 'fore i cut your daughter
yo quiero taco bell, then i hit the border
pitty pat rappers trying to get to 5
i'm a microphone fiend tryin' to stay alive
when you come to atl, boy, you better not hide
'cause the dungeon family gon' ride, hah

socially i'm not inane, black and white got game
if you came to the jam, well i'm glad you came
see, nigga first was used back in the deep south
falling out between the dome of the white man's mouth
it means that we will never grow, you know the word dummy
upper niggas in the community think it's crummy
but i don't, neither does the youth cause we em 
brace adversity it goes right with the race
and being that we use it as a term of endearment
niggas start to bug, to the dome is where the fear went
now the little shorties say it all of the time
and a whole bunch of niggas throw the word in they rhyme
yo i start to flinch, as i try not to say it
but my lips is like the oowop as i start to spray it
my lips is like a oowop as i start to spray it
my lips is like a oowop as i start to spray the

oh, i, nanana nanana nanana nanana, woah
before you get a boyfriend

please pardon me for keeping distance
it's not that i don't seek persistence but
i like what this is, how it is
so i hope you don't look at it as me being different
because you know i don't got no secret mission
i reside between your thighs, baby switch positions
now we're looking eye to eye, i hear your thoughts, listen
baby i already love you but just won't admit it
maybe i fell in love with you the day i saw you
maybe you fell in love with me the night we did it
maybe you already love me and just won't spit it
one thing i can say our love is how you ain't tripping
ain't tripping over the hoes
ain't slipping under unknown
just kissin', rubbing your kitten
got fingers all in your
ain't dipping in the with o
just slipping out of the clothes
dipping out of the robe
it's getting out of control like

oh, i, nanana nanana nanana nanana, woah
before you get a boyfriend, girl
oh, i, nanana nanana nanana nanana, woah
before you get a boyfriend

she got them hips turn style hot
i'm ready to rock and roll
proper spliffs, well she got, she know how to scroll
all this place is pain but she paid the toll
and when i'm in a rush she understands the give and go
the dominance is prominent, the mutual is crucial, girl
put my metal in your microwave  so we could watch it blow 
and if you need anything don't hesitate to let me know
and i'll be there in a jiffy with a stiffy in the piffy  like ah 
when it comes to you i have not because i asked nice
you're spaced out, i'm an astronaut
letting time fly by and what not
but you never throw shade though the sun hot
we don't need no sunblock
my closure blinker
feel the love but never speak up
while i get to know you deeper
while i mix the track while you mix the margarita
while you start dance while i'm turning up the speaker
no, i'm not that type to link up but i kinda
'cause i'ma see another bad drip and wanna holla
but maybe we could build, if it's not a problem
but either way i just had to keep it honest like

oh, i, nanana nanana nanana nanana, woah
before you get a boyfriend, girl
oh, i, nanana nanana nanana nanana, woah
before you get a boyfriend
oh, i, nanana nanana nanana nanana, woah
before you get a boyfriend, girl
oh, i, nanana nanana nanana nanana, woah
before you get a boyfriend




nobody move, there's blood on the floor
and i can't find my heart
where did it go? did i leave it in the cold?
so please give it back, 'cause it's not yours to take
it must've fell when i lost my mind
deep in the cut, drowning in a pain
somebody help 'cause i can't find my way
nobody move, nobody move

somebody tell me how i'm supposed to feel
when i'm sitting here knowing this ain't real
why in the world would i give my heart to you?
just to watch you throw it in the trash
i've been traveling so long, i don't think i can hold on
where were you when i needed you the most?
now i'm sitting here with a black hole in my chest
a heartless, broken mess
ooh oh, ooh oh, oh
ooh oh oh, ooh oh oh
ooh oh, ooh oh, oh
ooh oh oh, ooh oh oh


they split my world into pieces, i ain't heard from my nieces
i been feeling defeated, like i'm the worst in the boyband
i ain't sleep in some weekends, tryna headline both weekends
lead my niggas, y'all sheepin', i keep the world in my hands
i know accounts should be deleted
i know some niggas should stop hitting my phone
whenever they needing money or favors done
'cause i'm still worried 'bout when ashlan finna put the razor down
so i don't really give a fuck about what story they done spun
and i ain't done  no, no  yeah  tell something 
and i ain't done, you heard me? i ain't done
 yeah, i'm screaming oh, oh, oh, oh oh 
i really miss the old days before the cosigns
i really miss them cold days before the road signs
i really miss when i ain't know which way i was supposed to head
and i was pressed because my shawty gave me cold signs
i was writing poems 'bout her, dawg, in study hall
and she was mad 'cause i never wanna show her off  scared 
and every time she took her bra off my dick would get soft
i thought i had a problem, kept my head inside a pillow screaming

i don't wanna waste no more time
i'm ready to go
i put my life on standby
i can leave you alone


'cause we're born with a dollar sign attached to our temple
life is a dish served cold most times
and all my life i've taken handfuls
force fed by the hand that feeds us
but not all hands created equal
i stand by, waiting for something good to come
in due time, the skies will split for the sun to smile

my mother called me today
she said she thought she felt my energy a country away
i apologized for not calling enough due to weight
but couldn't tell you if i kept it in my head to decay
i asked her "why this world love echoing hate?"
she said "don't let those who don't know you start dictating your fate"
i think the hardest part of love could be rebuilding the breaks
conditioned to omit them until our foundation will shake
it's no debate
the road to peace is filled with snakes, you gotta keep your cool
and recognize the wolves that wanna try and leave you wool
don't let 'em treat you like a window, you know you're a jewel
this world is cruel and not as simple as they teach in schools
sometimes you gotta step away and check your own intentions
and analyze if what they do can compromise your vision
if people trust you, they don't need to question your decisions
you never needed them if they make you another villain

pressure
"they tried to take the bike. and they took my friend's bike and then my friend was gonna get it back but then he didn't get it back and then we had to go to the police station. and then, um, then some   pressure  random stranger brought back his bike. we just, you know, and we didn't tell our mums so we got in trouble  pressure makes me   because they found out like a day later."
do you want to start the game again?

pressure makes me lash back, wish i could get past that
i can't take a step back, makes me wish you'd pass that
pressure makes me lash back, wish i could get past that
i can't take a step back, makes me wish you'd pass that
take it all or leave it
pressure makes, pressure makes, pressu 
wish i could, wish i could, wish i 
i can't take, i can't take, i can't 
makes me wish, makes me wish, makes me 
pressure makes, pressure makes, pressu 
wish i could, wish i could, wish i

makes me wish, makes me wish, makes me

i sip the dom p, watchin' gandhi 'til i'm charged, then
writin' in my book of rhymes, all the words past the margin
behold the mic i'm throbbin', mechanical movement
understandable smooth shit that murderers move with
the thief's theme, play me at night, they won't act right
the fiend of hip hop has got me stuck like a crack pipe
the mind activation, react like i'm facin'
time like pappy mason, with pens i'm embracin'
wipe the sweat off my dome, spit the phlegm on the streets
suede timbs on my feet makes my cipher complete
whether cruisin' in a six cab or montero jeep
i can't call it, the beats make me fallin' asleep
i keep fallin', but never fallin' six feet deep
i'm out for presidents to represent me  say what? 
i'm out for presidents to represent me  say what?

god bless your life
to my peoples throughout queens

i trip, we box up crazy bitches
aimin' guns in all my baby pictures
beef with housing police, release scriptures that's maybe hitler's
yet i'm the mild, money gettin' style, rollin' foul
the versatile, honey stickin', wild, golden child
dwellin' in the rotten apple, you get tackled
or caught by the devil's lasso, shit is a hassle
there's no days for broke days
we sell it, smoke pays, while all the old folks pray
to jesús, soakin' their sins in trays of holy water
odds against nas are slaughter
thinkin' a word best describin' my life to name my daughter
my strength, my son, the star will be my resurrection
born in correction, all the wrong shit i did
he'll lead a right direction
how you livin'? large, a broker charge, cards are mediocre
you flippin' coke or playin' spit, spades, and strip poker?

it's yours, it's yours
it's yours, it's yours

i'm the young city bandit, hold myself down single handed
for murder raps, i kick my thoughts alone, get remanded
born alone, die alone, no crew to keep my crown or throne
i'm deep by sound alone, caved inside, 1,000 miles from home
i need a new nigga for this black cloud to follow
 cause while it's over me it's too dark to see tomorrow
tryin' to maintain, i flip, fill the clip to the tip
picturin' my peeps not eatin' can make my heartbeat skip
and i'm amped up, they locked the champ up
even my brain's in handcuffs
headed for indiana, stabbin' women like the phantom
the crew is lampin', big willie style
check the chip toothed smile, plus i profile wild
stash loot in fly clothes, burnin' dollars to light my stoge
walk the blocks with a bop, checkin' dames
plus the games people play bust the problems of the world today

 it's yours

if you feel the urge to freak, do the jitterbug
come and spread your arms if you really need a hug
afrocentric living is a big shrug
a life filled with fun that's what i love
a lower plateau is what we're above
if you diss us, we won't even think of

weeded up, please, speed it up
sittin' in the cali sun heated up
inked arm needled up
rocket style, don cheadle'd up

people lookin' at me sideways like i'm on the verge
like them on the purp that's blazed, i don't say a word

you ain't got the nerve
you just wanna swerve with a little herb, absurd
got you paranoid in the paragraph when i paraphrase
got a pair of jordan's dancin' on your fuckin' face
paralyzed, see the paranormal paratroops
summoned by the grandmaster as he prepares to loose
temple doors open up, smoke billows out
now you hoping, what, for mercy? get your soul brilloed out
from another hood, you ain't really fuckin' with our brotherhood
even if another could, i wish a motherfucker would
clip it up or sip it up

ever heard of me?
wicked as you ever seen
heavy on the throttle
smoke when we hit the scene, rollin' unseen
under the cover of night
spirit flying free, niggas higher than a kite
you got nothing on me, we some nomads
and my clan goes way back to the cro mags
run together, unbreakable bloodline
too much to fuck with when all the brothers combine
everything you ever heard of is not a myth
crazy dogs you don't ever wanna deal with
which smell? it's the hash that we left around
smoke a whole pound when i feel myself comin' down
live how i wanna live and answer to no one
similar to the ways of the shogun
think again before you try and come and get me
or you'll be shot up by a gang of gypsies  shot

your inner strength is the reason you haven't said a word
but your countenance reveals the bad day that you've endured
it's probably not the first and not the last to be assured
the past is fleeting the future
a promise present keeping us moving forward
with hope we seek true happiness
throughout our lives with
trials we face bring pain and sorrow, but resistance, sir, is strength
the easy path rarely leads to what our heart truly desires
in this life we must face many a worthy challenge for the outcome to satisfy us
to win inspite of struggle implies much greater magnification
to ones honor which i value more than instant gratification
so believe me when i say that time can heal most any wound
and ease most pain, yet the scars remain until the day we lay entombed
so please know nothing in this moment is the same as a moment ago
each one that pass is a treasure lost.......

 i just hope you know that, that it gets 
that it gets better with time
 i just hope you know that, that it gets 
that it gets better with time
 i just hope you know that, that it gets 
that it gets better with time
 i just hope you know that, that it gets 
that it gets better with time
 i just hope you know that, that it gets 
 i just hope you know that, that it gets 
 i just hope you know that, that it gets 
 i just hope you know that, that it gets 

tommorrow's not in your hands
that's why i pray to the man
and i think it's arrogant to make plans in advance
one day at a time
i burn the sage for all the negative, pay it no mind
i'm at ease with the struggles, they're better with time
need not i remind
tomorrow's not in your hands, neither is control
nigga, reap what you sow and pay it in full
think before you burn the bridge, paying the toll
just play your role
so much pressure in the world i started my gnashing teeth
hit the gas so hard i blew a gasket and leaked
drain me for what i got like a nasty leech
you'll find hard learned lessons just asking our teach'
life is what you make it, take it how you gon' take it
my ground is solid and no earthquake could not shake it
ain't waiting on nothing, not even no reparations
heavily meditating, but it gets better with time
and i'm sober now, no alcohol to hide behind
i grow older and grow bolder
i move mountains and move boulders
i cross borders, don't take orders
and thank god, that's important


you ain't gotta tell me i been on your mind
you fell asleep in my t shirt
gripping my pillow tight
you didn't think i would be here tonight
went to bed listenin' to what we like
made the perfect little playlist
looks like somebody was makin' plans to welcome me home again

but i landed early and i couldn't wait up
i been missin' you lately, i made my escape
but it seems like i'm already here in your dreams
and i couldn't stand to mess up a good thing

 it's been a mighty long time since i held you tight 
but i can't wake you when you're dreaming of me
 get ready for the sunrise, i'ma make it right 
but i can't wake you when you're dreaming of me

lately i've been puttin' in overtime, life on the road can get lonely
i was never good with time away and it gets a little harder everyday
everything is better when i'm by your side, i mean the world is amazin'
all i ever really want to do is make my way back to you

but i landed early and i couldn't wait up
i been missin' you lately, i made my escape
but it seems like i'm already here in your dreams
and i couldn't stand to mess up a good thing

 it's been a mighty long time since i held you tight 
but i can't wake you when you're dreaming of me
 get ready for the sunrise, i'ma make it right 
but i can't wake you when you're dreaming of me

you've been calling my phone all day
i'm sorry if i made you worry
but now that i'm standin' in your grace
i'm reminded why i have to earn it

 it's been a mighty long time since i held you tight 
but i can't wake you when your dreaming of me
 get ready for the sunrise, i'ma make it right 
but i can't wake you when you're dreaming of me


hey, i wanna give you a little advice
i noticed that you're not acting yourself
and i'm sure you're probably having some problems in your relationship
but, i want to tell you this
i met this guy that, uh, this guy that you dated
and i can't think of his name, but anyway
he says he's a nice young fella
and i gotta say this, if you're willing to work it out
that shows you love one another

for him she packed all her louie  all her louie 
all her gucci  all her gucci 
all her prada  all her prada 
but somehow she left her heart
i heard that she called her momma  she called her momma 
told her she's leaving  told her she's leaving 
said she was tired  said she was tired 
momma said, "tired ain't through"
she didn't understand
she didn't know the power of man
so we both know
one day she's going back to be with him, be with him
so whoever's ? is just a rebound, rebound, a rebound
i call it recess
but when this gets old, you better know, she's going back
to that good old, good old
faithful, faithful, faithful

dear me, you got some work to do to better you
he said some hurtful things, but i know all of it was true
i may not mean it though it comes off as an attitude
and that ain't good for us, when we have problems i can't talk 'em through
gotta learn to listen, can't cut him off when he talkin' too
i know you only get upset though cause you love him, this is true
really don't understand and he need to stop and listen too
a two way street, you both need to meet like tires on the coupe
i know it's hard cause you was raised that way just like your momma
and you yell a bit and that was it, that really drove him off the roof
got you packin' bags, when inside you know you don't wanna lose
what you got, cause baby make you laugh and when it all is cool
and all is cool, but then you got some pride and got some scars to prove
that you don't trust him, thought your heart is crying all the baby blues
the other dude's lyin' about the way you feel about him too
and momma askin' how you do and you say, "fine" she know that you
pretending, she remembering that she was young just like you
tryin' to talk, but you won't listen, stubborn but you're hurtin' boo
you left your heart and i know he's all you think about
brand new start just won't happen cause you just can't do without


yo, i got it bad i'm tryin' to fight it, hide it from the world
but momma's right, damn, she really knows her baby girl
checkin' on his twitter page to see what he did yesterday
i miss him and this dating game i'm playing is just that, a game
thumbing through my contacts, always manage to stop on his name
i wanna call him, well dammit won't you do it then?
i tell myself, wastin' all this time on all these other men
that interest and it's just a break though until i'm back with him
unless he datin' too, unlike me, havin' fun with them
makin' love with them, cause maybe he feels that i'm over him
then what? what if he don't take me back forever
then i'm left here with these maybes and what if we stuck together
and these why you nevers, like why you never call him?
thinkin' of my lonely days stuck in my room bawlin'
rain on the window mirror, saw the tears i let go
my pride and all these scars inside, it's time for me to let go
so what we fall, like momma said, it's not unusual
need to pack my bags, go back, cause what we had was beautiful




yeah man
so i start looking out the window
i see gun store, gun store, liquor store, gun store
where the fuck are you taking me?

we bout to twist it up
we bout to lift it up
we never givin' up
the startin' salary, it's hard reality
find solidarity
we got our leaders too but where they lead us ?
do they leave us or they see it through?
yeah we packin' precious metals
our shit is next level
we raise the threat level

every ghetto, every city, like ms. hill
they way too used to the missed meals
hard to concentrate, hard to sit still
murder rate permanent place in the top 10
we live here, these hipsters drop in
you hear them barrels cockin'
they say consciousness mean a nigga ain't rugged
until they get beat within an inch of it
self made niggas don't get discovered
they actin' like you owe 'em somethin'
homie i don't owe you nothin'
fuck your beef
it's way too early in the mornin' for the hate
you ain't brushed your teeth yet nigga
and your toast ain't buttered
a perfect storm and the coast is flooded
most discovered that my flow got 'em
you posers sound like  stuttered
man i'm goin' too fast, let me slow it down

i'm good walkin' in every ghetto around the world
the hood often embrace ya when you profound with words
i say the shit they relate to, i keep it down to earth
other rappers sound like they hate you, them niggas sound absurd
so when they walk through the ghetto they get their chain snatched
they gotta talk to the ghetto to get their chain back
it's like an open air prison and it remain packed
nothin' but straight facts

indie 5, for the people by the people
ya ya, giddy up, who got the juice now?
snatch it out your kiddies cups
the shit you gave us watered down
this one's for basquiat
they be brushin' with death, uh
is this the art of war for cops?
we double dutchin' duckin' shots
every home ain't got a pops
every man ain't sellin' rocks
a different will to win here
different from switchin' cars
they pray that we switch our bars
to a fiend from a metaphor
worldstar, worldstar
lotta love and this life hard
keep us prayin' like "oh god"
illegally thievery think us peelin' off easily
frustrated we hate it
that's why we scream out "nigga we made it"
it's an odd future they ain't know we was all some creators
somethin' from nothin' was told kings walk and man you frontin'
for the people and by the people but them over money
i'm on my viola davis here, workin' for justice
how you get away with murder? be a cop and just kill us
how we supposed to not catch feelings?
innocent lives, boy we got kids in these buildings
i'm on my viola davis, it's what you call a defense
for all the drama they gave us i'm spittin' shonda rhimes wit
too high for you like ganja, that s what shonda rhyme with
i holla back in the hamptons, you still black if you rich
spread love ain't just the brooklyn way, it's universal
360 and the nine lives, whoa, what a circle

we bout to live it up
we bout to give it up
we bout to twist it up
the startin' salary, it's hard reality
find solidarity
we got our leaders too but do they leave us?
or they lead us and they see it through?

big old whiskey on them icy rocks
flood down some veins like oxy does
i need fresh air, i need oxygen
who the hell you fooling? it's so obvious
i don't feel it, i don't see it, this is blasphemy
i can't help but feel like you is after me
is you drinking for the pain? is you drinking for fun?
there's a party outside, 'til the morning gon' come
is you dancing all alone? is you dancing for someone?
there's a party outside, know the night is young
is you having fun?

say it with your chest, say it with your chest
pray it work again
putting diamonds on my back, putting diamonds on my back, yeah
say it with your chest, say it with your chest
pray it work again
putting diamonds on my back, putting diamonds on my back, yeah

but you know if i waste my time
talking 'bout what ain't mine
and you know i'll be last in line
just like last, last night

i said, i said "who that? who that? who that? who that?"
lurking in the shadows
tryna catch me liberating spirits from the gallows
they wanna blackball me, but i held my avocados
then they melt down like the hash we mix in our tobacco
circle tighter than the castro, they feeding you castrol
you'd think that it's gas, you turn the key, it's a fiasco
could be stronger than vibranium, don't mean that i ain't fragile
grapple with reality to break out of these shackles

but you know if i waste my time
talking 'bout what ain't mine
and you know i'll be last in line
just like last, last night

suicidal thoughts, but i won't do it
take that how you want, it's important i admit it
i'm afraid of commitment, don't know how to fix it
maybe codependent, can't tell the difference
when the push comes to shove, i'd rather bend than break
but something's gotta give, ain't that what they say
when you're torn between reality, and a choice you could have made
or should've made, they're not the same, i'm not the same
maybe i'm broken, either way i'm clinging on closely
i know it's unhealthy, appreciate your patience
i know that i'm selfish, do my best to be selfless
i know that i'm changing, i know that i'm changing

i want more out of life than this
i want more, i want more
i want more out of life than this
i want more, i want more
i want more out of life than this
i want more, i want more
i want more out of life than this
i want more, i want more
i want more out of life than this
i want more, i want more
i want more out of life than this

i admit i guess i'm full of myself too
there's just a bunch of shit, i wish i could tell you, but
this life moves fast, i never knew that
yours wouldn't have lasted, the dirt hitting your casket, like raindrops
i swear i'll let you know when the pain stops
for now, i need to run to any
place the train stops

when my name get brought up
you had a girl, i kinda wish you knocked her up
so i could meet your son and talk you up  talk you up 

i remember when we were just kids
we knew nothing at all, we'd talk about the life we lived
in west virginia, lost somewhere out in
west virginia

it's a dark science, when your friends start dying
like, "how could he go? he was part lion"
life goes on, tears all dried in
couple years are gone by by then
can you please help me find my friend
i'll give you anything you need
multiplied by ten

where the time don't end
you don't need money
all you got is time to spend
life is short, don't ever question the lengths
it's cool to cry
don't ever question your strength
i recommend no limits, intricate
thought, go 'head just give it a shot
you'll remember shit you've forgot

cause way back then i didn't know shit
and i don't know shit now
and when the whole world is looking hopeless
i'mma still hold shit down

i remember when we were just kids
we knew nothing at all, we'd talk about the life we lived
in west virginia, lost somewhere out in
west virginia

the ambulances signals and glances
so let's hurry up and don't take no chances
niggas step to us trying to rap like we got all the answers
in front of the store trying to work that sleight of hand
the panhandlers, they not no amateurs
daily reminders of how i gotta find a way to come up
it sums up life along with the kids and a wife
but anyway, we pass the local grocery store
and you can be sure the meats and the produce ain't good no more
some of it is from days before
i want it fresh and the clerk ain't my race so he stress
they doin me in my community   fuck it, we there
ain't enough for a 6 pack so we had to share
a nice little stroll through the april spring air
we hide our shit so the nation don't see it there

but shorty didn't quit, it was something in the air
yeah, he said it was something so appealing
he couldn't fight the feeling, something about it
he knew he couldn't doubt it, couldn't understand it
branded, since the first kickflip he landed, uh
labeled a misfit, a bandit
ka kunk, ka kunk, ka kunk; his neighbors couldn't stand it
so, he was banished to the park
started in the morning, wouldn't stop 'til after dark
yeah, when they said "it's getting late in here
so i'm sorry, young man, there's no skating here"

and so he kick, push, kick, push

met his girlfriend, she was clapping in the crowd
love is what what was happening to him now
he said "i would marry you
but i'm engaged to these aerials and varials
and i don't think this board is strong enough to carry two"
she said "bow, i weigh a hundred and twenty pounds
now, let me make one thing clear
i don't need to ride yours, i got mine right here"
so she took him to a spot he didn't know about
some odd end apartment parking lot
she said "i don't normally take dates in here"
security came and said "i'm sorry, there's no skating here"

an escape route they used to escape out
when things got crazy, they needed to break out
they'd head to any place with stairs
any good grinds, the world was theirs
and their four wheels would take them there
until the cops came and said "there's no skating here"

 man, motherfucker, i told you i was gonna get you next 


have you ever met a girl that you tried to date
but a year to make love she wanted you to wait
let me tell ya a story of my situation
i was talkin' to this girl from the u.s. nation
the way that i met her was on tour at a concert
she had long hair and a short miniskirt
i just got onstage drippin', pourin' with sweat
i was walkin' through the crowd and guess who i met
i whispered in her ear, "come to the picture booth
so i can ask you some questions to see if you are a hundred proof"
i asked her her name, she said blah blah blah
she had 9 10 pants and a very big bra
i took a couple of flicks and she was enthused
i said, "how do you like the show?" she said, "i was very amused"
i started throwin' bass, she started throwin' back mid range
but when i sprung the question, she acted kind of strange
then when i asked, "do ya have a man," she tried to pretend
she said, "no i don't, i only have a friend"
come on
i'm not even goin' for it, this is what i'm goin' sing

you, you got what i need
but you say he's just a friend
and you say he's just a friend, oh baby
you got what i need
but you say he's just a friend
but you say he's just a friend, oh baby
you got what i need
but you say he's just a friend
but you say he's just a friend

so i took blah blah's word for it at this time
i thought just havin' a friend couldn't be no crime
'cause i have friends and that's a fact
like agnes, agatha, germaine, and jack
forget about that, let's go into the story
about a girl named blah blah blah that adored me
so we started talkin', getttin' familiar
spendin' a lot of time so we can build up
a relationship or some understanding
how it's gonna be in the future we was plannin'
everything sounded so dandy and sweet
i had no idea i was in for a treat
after this was established, everything was cool
the tour was over and she went back to school
i called every day to see how she was doin'
every time that i called her it seemed somethin' was brewin'
i called her room, a guy picked up, but then i called again
i say, "yo, who was that?" "oh, he's just a friend"
don't gimme that, don't ever gimme that
jus' bust this

you, you got what i need
but you say he's just a friend
and you say he's just a friend, oh baby
you got what i need
but you say he's just a friend
but you say he's just a friend, oh baby
you got what i need
but you say he's just a friend
but you say he's just a friend

so i came to her college on a surprise visit
to see my girl that was so exquisite
it was a school day, i knew she was there
the first semester of the school year
i went to a gate to ask where was her dorm
this guy made me fill out a visitor's form
he told me where it was and i was on my way
to see my baby doll, i was happy to say
i arrived in front of the dormitory
"yo, could you tell me where is door three?"
they showed me where it was for the moment
i didn't know i was in for such an event
so i came to her room and opened the door
oh, snap  guess what i saw?
a fella tongue kissin' my girl in her mouth
i was so in shock my heart went down south
so please listen to the message that i send
don't ever talk to a girl who says she just has a friend

somehow we gotta find a way
no matter how many miles it takes
i know it feels so good right now
but it all come fallin' down
when the night, meet the light
turn to day
can't stop, yeah, you won't stop
i know just how that feel
when you're on top, 'til the ball drop
you've never seen it be so real
it feels so good right now
but it all come fallin' down
when the night, meets the light
turn to day

feel it a little, feel it a lot
i'm swimmin' a bit, but deeper in thought
keepin' my head on top of my shoulders
into some shit, i'm out of the box
this the level i'm on
needin' it all right now when forever is gone
baby, the weather is strong
whether it's hot or cold
i'm comin', knockin' on your door
well, i'ma, i'ma maintain, i'm stayin' so high
put the ladder all the way up 'til we touchin' the sky
and you know you're dead wrong, you're in love with a lie
all i, all i, all i wanna do is free your mind
we don't see no lines, we don't color inside
it's a very small world, we don't fuck with the size
yeah, see the bigger picture when it's beneficial
lovin' how i catch you
blow the whistle when you run out of time
yeah, wakin' up i open up my eyes
do you mind if i blow your mind?
a little closer, baby, don't be shy
why you worried that it's gon' be fine?
i guess it's that kinda day
it's really all i'm tryna say
we don't have a lot of time to waste
somehow we gotta find a way

somehow we gotta find a way
no matter how many miles it takes
i know it feels so good right now
but it all comes fallin' down
when the night, meet the light
turn to day

i wouldn't wait forever
just shoot your shot
we don't need no more, no extras
we all we got


yeah, yeah
all the  lights flickerin', hittin' the right switches
i'm livin' this life different and missin' the flight bullshittin'
i had a plan to change, you can't stand the rain
little delay, but i came and you're cool with it
i don't trip, flip or lose my grip
and i don't know it all, but i do know this
before you know me, better know self
i've been in this shit so long that it don't smell
i turn the hotel to a castle
livin' like a king for a grand
i don't do nothin', that's a hassle
besides, even that castle's made of sand
just might slip into the sea
fuck it all, if it all ain't me
maybe we inside the maze
somehow, we gotta find a way, okay

somehow we gotta find a way
no matter how many miles it takes
i know it feels so good right now
but it all comes fallin' down
when the night, meet the light
turn to day

i wouldn't wait forever
just shoot your shot
we don't need no more, no extras
we all we got



some people look at me and talk about me like a clown
they just don't realize it's just my simple way to get down
i've got that supertouch, chances are i've got too much
i've come to let you see, that you also can be free
it seems that every time we all try to go underground
the stinking troopers them they think that we are fooling around
we have had about enough, now we're gonna get real tough
it happens everyday, that's why we got p.m.a
we have had about enough, now we're gonna get real tough
it happens everyday, we got supertouch

people just pretending, that's a let down
undercover lover, that's my heart now
struggle just in living, that's the realm of
accept me as i'm not, and that's a shitfit
my best, ain't good enough for you
my test, is what you gonna do
ain't no, any kind of way
love was, lost in yesterday
now we've, felt this
so you'll, get yours now
everybody's living
and nobody's giving
and nobody gives a damn
you must understand me
the end is surely coming
prepare for the final plan
people just pretending, that's a let down
undercover lover, that's my heart now
struggle just in living, that's the realm of
accept me as i'm not, and that's a shitfit


having hallucinations
i'm losing sleep every night
keep trying to cover my eyes
my eyes, yeah
is it my imagination?
i think i'm losing my mind
still see your face all the time
all the time

tryna rewind 'til we're back where we started
yeah that's all i want
and night after night after night i'm still haunted
i'm haunted, baby
i'm haunted by you, you
fall asleep and dream of you, you
late at night i scream for you, you
waiting on a deja vu
but until then

i live with hallucinations
they're just hallucinations
i'll just hallucinate
'cause you're not here
hallucinations

losing my concentration
hearing your voice in my head
seeing you when you aren't there
you're not there
and i can't keep living like this
something's gotta give  give me you 
if i could make it all go away
then i would

tryna rewind 'til we're back where we started
yeah that's all i want
and night after night after night i'm still haunted
i'm haunted, baby
i'm haunted by you, you
fall asleep and dream of you, you
late at night i scream for you, you
waiting on a deja vu

suicide it's a suicide, biddy bye bye
suicide it's a suicide
suicide it's a suicide, biddy bye bye
suicide it's a suicide

so you wanna die, commit suicide
dial 1 800 cyanide line
far as life, yo, it ain't worth it
put a rope around your neck and jerk it
the trick didn't work
your life was fucked up from the first day of birth
after watching jackie gleason, walk into a precinct
gun down the captain for no fucking reason
and get some lsd or a drink from the bar
get behind your wheel and crash the car
like desert storm, got bombs for the war
confront an alligator, let it eat ya raw
back to the function, riding the caboose to hell
bzzzzzt touched the third rail
you fucked up chicken, now you just got fried
cause it's a suicide

suicide it's a suicide, biddy bye bye
suicide it's a suicide
suicide it's a suicide, biddy bye bye
suicide it's a suicide

hey, you, little rich kid, what's your beef?
come and tell the grym reaper all of your grief
you asked for a benz and you only got a jeep
your pop's got ends, but yo, he's mad cheap
maybe you're a bastard child, you think
mom and dad are white and you're dark as ink
maybe you're sicilian with a tan
but you hate lasagna and the pizza man
now you stand on the gravedigga plot and
you're singing the blues about the rough life you've got
 not   you don't wanna live no more
i guess you're really ready for the graveyard tour
when you get home, just seal up your windows and you doors
turn your oven on high for about four hours
light you a blunt, kiss your ass goodbye
you gassed yourself, 'cause it's a suicide

suicide it's a suicide, biddy bye bye
suicide it's a suicide
suicide it's a suicide, biddy bye bye
suicide it's a suicide

yep, i've said it before and i'll say it again
life moves pretty fast
if you don't stop and look around every once in a while
you could miss it

six fucking devils stepped up playing brave, god
had the fucking nerve to try and enter my graveyard
i'm the rzarector, be my sacrifice
commit suicide and i'll bring you back to life
the first was convinced, stuck a water hose in his mouth
at full blast so his head can explode
second one said, "hmmmm, that's good but i can top it "
put a axe up to his head and then he chopped it
blood shot out in every direction
the rest didn't know what to do, i made suggestions
put a slug in your mug; overdose on a drug
wet your hand, stick a knife in the plug
or be like richard pryor, set your balls on fire
better yet, go hang yourself with a barbed wire
three and four fell deep into the spell and
ran to the zoo, locked themselves in the lion's den
number five said, "it ain't worth being alive "
smoked a dust joint, mixed it with cyanide
the only one who escaped was number six
he went home, sat in the tub, and slit his wrists
yeah, more graves to dig, goodbye
there's no need to cry... 'cause we all die


i'm just a bachelor
i'm looking for a partner

my saddle's waitin', come and jump on it
if you're horny, let's do it, ride it, my pony
my saddle's waitin', come and jump on it

sitting here flossing
peeping your steelo
just once if i have the chance
the things i would do to you

juices flowing down your thigh

how does one attempt to be
the kind of friend that you would want to keep?
i just want to say to thee
even though it might be hard to believe
the candy coated thoughts that drift through my sleep
lets me know it's you that holds the key
i got a craving for confection so sweet
for the taste of when our lips first meet

oh, in another life, i bet you wouldn't know that
oh, in another life, i bet you were my girl

i just wanna take you with me
to secret rooms in the mansions of my mind
shower you with all that you need
take my hand, i swear i'll take my time
i'm not surprised to find that angels compete
for the chance to lay down at your feet
i'm gonna touch in all of the places that please
pull you close
i wanna feel you breathe

oh, in another life, i bet you wouldn't know that
oh, in another life, i bet you were my girl
it's another reason for the season
i don't wanna break your heart
oh, in another life, i bet you were my girl, oh 
in another life, i bet you wouldn't know that
in another life, i bet you were my girl
oh, in another life, i bet you wouldn't know that

fake  fake  records  records 
uh, uh, uh, 1 2, 1 2
uh, uh, 1 2, 1 2, uh, uh
all my dogs

it's bigger than hip hop, hip hop, hip hop, hip
it's bigger than hip hop, hip hop, hip hop, hip hop

one thing bout music when it hit you feel no pain
white folks say it controls your brain
i know better than that, that's game
and we ready for that
two soldiers head of the pack
matter fact, who got the gat?
and where my army at?
rather attack than not react
back to beats, it don't reflect on how many records get sold
on sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll
whether your project's put on hold
in the real world; these just people with ideas
they just like me and you when the smoke and camera disappear
again the real world; it's bigger than all these fake ass records
when poor folks got the millions and my woman's disrespected
if you check 1 2, my word of advice to you is just relax
just do what you got to do; if that don't work then kick the facts
if you a fighter, rider, biter, flame ignitor, crowd exciter
or you wanna just get high then just say it
but then if you a liar liar, pants on fire, wolf crier, agent with a wire
i'm gon' know it when i play it

it's bigger than hip hop, hip hop, hip hop, hip
it's bigger than hip hop, hip hop, hip hop, hip hop

who shot biggie smalls, if we don't get them, they gon' get us all
i'm down for running up on them crackers in their city hall
we ride for y'all, all my dogs, stay real
nigga don't think these record deals gon' feed your seeds and pay your bills
because they not
mc's get a little bit of love and think they hot
talking bout how much money they got;
nigga, all y'all records sound the same
i'm sick of that fake thug r b rap scenario, all day on the radio
same scenes in the video
monotonous material
y'all don't hear me though
these record labels slang our tapes like dope
you can be next in line and signed and still be writing rhymes and broke
you would rather have a lexus or justice?
a dream or some substance?
a beamer, a necklace or freedom?
still a nigga like me don't playa hate, i just stay awake
this real hip hop
and it don't stop 'til we get the po po off the block
they call it...

hip hop, hip hop, hip hop, hip
it's bigger than hip hop, hip hop, hip hop, hip hop
it's bigger than hip hop, hip hop, hip hop, hip
it's bigger than hip hop, hip hop, hip hop, hip hop

dpz got that crazy shit
we keep it crunked up, john blazed and shit

when you told me the truth, even if it really hurt
'cuz you knew a lie was worse  that's love 
when you let me borrow money, that you didn't really have
'cuz you knew what i was worth  that's love 
when i was at my worst, you would tell me i would blow
when i thought that i would burst  that's love 
you taught me how to help others, and through that discover
how to put myself first
and here we are again, just confronting fears
whether pain, or gain, it's a bunch of tears
blood, sweats, and peers, probably disappear
when smoke starts to clear, their persistence near
pay attention to the folks, who're fanning the flames
they're the ones who matter most, in the gravity game
when stakes weigh you down, and they stay around
and pick up pieces, and you off the ground
that's love

that's love
that's love
that's love
aye, that's love, that's love
that's love, that's
that's love, love, love
that's love

when you were giving me advice, that i seldom ever took
but your head never shook  that's love 
both knowing you were right, never shook it left and right
just gave me that look  that's love 
when i had to learn the hard way, and you would let me fall
but never did it out of spite  that's love 
you told me never burn a bridge
if you build it, then you need it
whether a river or a brook
and here we are again, in the cross of paths
darwin s our friendship, strongest last
but our strength lies in our first thoughts that laugh at
the things that bring most hurt hearts to clash
funk passed the ball, beat bounced the brawl
pass it, penniless, blame games, and all
had a few deals, time out to chill
but knowing when you need space means you feel
in love

that's love
that's love
that's love
aye, that's love, that's love
that's love, that's
that's love, love, love
that's love

ooooooo, we try to tell ourselves
that we don't really need it anymore
as if a million dollars, or the bottom of a bottle
or a carton, never cheated me before
so you started with the "i don't need it, all i need is money"
"you can give it to me, but you'll never get it from me"
yea you refused to play, but you was still in the game
like it, or not, let me explain
now see
there's a tough kind, a too much kind
a not enough kind, a rather rushed kind
and the abrupt kind, a go nuts kind
a hold up, maybe we should take it slow kind
a when you know kind, it started off as friends
but then over time, began to show kind
and if we love each other, but we can't stay together
we'll do worse than better, gotta go kind
and that's love

that's love
that's love
that's love
aye, that's love, that's love
that's love, that's
that's love, love, love
that's love


this craft, this beat, this rhyme, this vibe
this style, they say music gives new life
from a source inside that is forever flowin'
this stage, this mic, this crowd, this show
this life, i've been given a gift tonight
and for that, i vow to be a vessel

i didn't have to be, given the gift to rip
i'll never master me, i know that it's from him
or her or it, dimensions that sit
waitin' to sift through me, i fall short, still it hits me swift
i didn't have to see, i coulda hit the lick
i coulda drifted quick, i coulda quit so quick
it's really a trip, i guess i was picked
i don't know what i did to deserve a ride like this  damn  
i didn't have to eat, i coulda been so thin
i didn't have to be, quoting these sentences
i didn't have to reap, the work put in but then
even the work in itself was such a blessin'
i didn't have to see, the planet tip to tip
i didn't have to make, a livin' writ to writ
i didn't have to dream and then begin to live it
and for that, i vow to be a vessel

this stage, this mic, this crowd, this show
this life, i've been given a gift tonight
and for that, i vow to be a vessel

i give thanks for my rhymin' ability
i don't front like it's not a responsibility
i can open a mind, if the youth will listen to me
i'm not goin' to front, like i'm on some killin' spree
and as hard as the times are, god is livin' through beats
that come not from minds
but that travel through spiritual reasons
some of the time, i feel like, it's not even me
no mon ey can buy gateways to infinity
still i'm hun gry to shine, when i know i should let it be
and i want but i have, every single thing that we need
so help me align self with soul and then i'll be free
to sculpt and design verbal styles and experience freedom

"let go, do what's in front of you"
"then, let go, then do what's in front of you"

this ain't leisure, although it feels
it is a duty, a way to live, another way to give
another way to just, have communion
with the source of the sun and moon and
a way to pay the bills
displayin' skills, i take it real serious
the vibe's so mysterious, not just one more day to kill
..and i could lose my connection
if i do not respect it enough, fade away it will
day to day it gives energies
that replenish me, if i believe and i say it will
and act on it, cause action is the key to freedom
only way to be a leader, lead by the way you live

my regrets look just like texts i shouldn't send
and i got neighbors, they're more like strangers
we could be friends
i just need a way out of my head
i'll do anything for a way out
of my head

in my own way, this feel like living
some alternate reality
and i was drowning, but now i'm swimming
through stressful waters to relief
yeah, oh, the things i'd do
to spend a little time in hell
and what i won't tell you
i'll prolly never even tell myself
and don't you know that sunshine don't feel right
when you inside all day
i wish it was nice out, but it looked like rain
grey skies and i'm drifting, not living forever
they told me it only gets better

my regrets look just like texts i shouldn't send

in the middle of the night, she checked his phone, erica, right
when he plead the fifth, man, it was on, matter of fact she gone
matter of fact tyrone was on speed dial
so when she got home, it was going down, she go:

cause when women get sick of men, they think of a big helping hand
to lend each other uncover emotions when lights dim
so when she telling her to come over, it'll be alright
the minute she hit the block and turn left, she'll be turning dyke, they:

check the script, me and the gods gettin' ripped
blunts in the dip, forty dogs in my lip
had a box, 'boom boom' the bass would blast
we was laughin' at all the girls that passed
conversation, brothers had began to discuss
 hey yo, rob, remember that kid you bust? 
aw yeah, he ran, but he didn't get far
'cause i dropped him, heh heh heh heh heh ha
not knowin' exactly what lied ahead
my little brother, my mother sent him out for bread
get the wonder, it's a hot day in the summer
didn't expect to come across a crazy gunner
"hey, shorty, check it for the bag and the dough "
but he was brave, looked him in the eye, and said "no "
money splattered him, bow  then he snatched the bag
hit his pockets, then he jetted up the ave
girls screamin', the noise up and down the block
 hey, rakeem   what?  your little brother got shot  
i ran frantically, then i dropped down to his feet
i saw the blood all over the hot concrete
i picked him up, then i held him by his head
his eyes shut, that's when i knew he was 
aw man  how do i say goodbye?
it's always the good ones that have to die
memories in the corner of my mind
flashbacks, i was laughin' all the time
i taught him all about the bees and birds
but i wish i had a chance to sing these three words

after laughter comes tears

me and my man, my ace big moe from the shelter
'bout to hit the skins from this girl named thelma
now, thelma had a rep that was higher than her neck
every girl from shaolin dissed her respect
we was stimmy, you know how it is when you're blitzed
three o'clock in the mornin', somethin' got to give
moe said he'll go first, i said i'll take next
here, take this raincoat and practice safe sex 
he seemed to ignore, i said, "be for real 
she's not even worth it to go raw deal."
a man's gonna do what a man's gonna do
he got butt naked and stuck the power u
twenty minutes went by, moe, i'm out without a doubt
i'm not pumpin' up, i am airin' out
hey yo, he came out laughin' with glory
i'm surprised he's still livin' to tell his story
but he carried on with the same old stuff
with stephanie, like a whammy, he pressed his luck
moe tried to be down with o.p.p.
ain't nothin' wrong, but he got caught with the h.i.v.
now no life to live, doc says two more years
so after the laughter i guess comes the tears

after laughter comes tears

i know i can
be what i wanna be
if i work hard at it
i'll be where i wanna be
i know i can  i know i can  
be what i wanna be  be what i wanna be  
if i work hard at it  if i work hard it  
i'll be where i wanna be  i'll be where i wanna be  

be, b boys and girls, listen up
you can be anything in the world, in god we trust
an architect, doctor, maybe an actress
but nothing comes easy, it takes much practice
like, i met a woman who's becoming a star
she was very beautiful, leaving people in awe
singing songs, lena horne, but the younger version
hung with the wrong person, got her strung on that heroin
cocaine, sniffing up drugs, all in her nose
could've died, so young, now looks ugly and old
no fun 'cause when she reaches for hugs, people hold their breath
'cause she smells of corrosion and death
watch the company you keep and the crowd you bring
'cause they came to do drugs and you came to sing
so if you gonna be the best, i'ma tell you how
put your hands in the air, and take the vow

i know i can  i know i can  
be what i wanna be  be what i wanna be  
if i work hard at it  if i work hard it  
i'll be where i wanna be  i'll be where i wanna be  
i know i can  i know i can  
be what i wanna be  be what i wanna be  
if i work hard at it  if i work hard it  
i'll be where i wanna be  i'll be where i wanna be  

be, b boys and girls, listen again
this is for grown looking girls who's only 10
the ones who watch videos and do what they see
as cute as can be, up in the club with fake id
careful, 'fore you meet a man with hiv
you can host the tv like oprah winfrey
whatever you decide, be careful, some men be
rapists, so act your age, don't pretend to be
older than you are, give yourself time to grow
you thinking he can give you wealth, but so
young boys, you can use a lot of help, you know
you thinking life's all about smoking weed and ice
you don't wanna be my age and can't read and write
begging different women for a place to sleep at night
smart boys turn to men and do whatever they wish
if you believe you can achieve, then say it like this

i know i can  i know i can  
be what i wanna be  be what i wanna be  
if i work hard at it  if i work hard it  
i'll be where i wanna be  i'll be where i wanna be  
now, go 
i know i can  i know i can  
be what i wanna be  be what i wanna be  
if i work hard at it  if i work hard it  
i'll be where i wanna be  i'll be where i wanna be  

be, be fore we came to this country
we were kings and queens, never porch monkeys
there was empires in africa called kush
timbuktu, where every race came to get books
to learn from black teachers who taught greeks and romans
asian arabs and gave them gold, when
gold was converted to money it all changed
money then became empowerment for europeans
the persian military invaded
they heard about the gold, the teachings, and everything sacred
africa was almost robbed naked
slavery was money, so they began making slave ships
egypt was the place that alexander the great went
he was so shocked at the mountains with black faces
shot up they nose to impose what basically
still goes on today, you see?
if the truth is told, the youth can grow
they learn to survive until they gain control
nobody says you have to be gangstas, hoes
read more, learn more, change the globe
ghetto children, do your thing
hold your head up, little man, you're a king
young princess when you get your wedding ring
your man is saying "she's my queen"

i know i can  i know i can  
be what i wanna be  be what i wanna be  
if i work hard at it  if i work hard it  
i'll be where i wanna be  i'll be where i wanna be  
i know i can  i know i can  
be what i wanna be  be what i wanna be  
if i work hard at it  if i work hard it  
i'll be where i wanna be  i'll be where i wanna be  

save the music, y'all

too high to jump in jail

get a life, now they on sale, then i might cast you a spell
look at what came in the mail
a scale and some arm and hammer
soul gold grill and a baby mama
black cadillac and a pack of pampers
stack of questions with no answers
cure for cancer, cure for aids
make a nigga wanna stay on tour for days
get back home, things are wrong
well, not really, it was bad all along
before you left adds up to a ball of power
thoughts at a thousand miles per hour

yo quiero taco bell, then i hit the border
pitty pat rappers trying to get to 5

god stepping forth upon holy ground of the track
it's the sound that surrounds and hurts me like i'm under attack
so i decided to bite down on the mic
so the pain of the track won't deny the fact that i'm the master
for what lurks, is an expert that hurts
the individual who tries to visualize under
cause i strike, like thunder
niggas couldn't stand my heat, it's unbearable
my wisdom fucks up your respiratorial
systems are fractured by the killer tactics
style is ragged and thoughts are mad jagged
enter the entity, my vicinity
is three hundred and sixty degrees of humidity
represent the school of hard knocks and glocks my
clan is hostile and got mad moss for blocks so
feel the force of impact from the iron side of
the gat as i attack the track
from the blind side of the pack, starks pass the chrome
watch a nigga get blown out his motherfucking dome piece
deceased, laid to rest

who come to get you, none, they want guns
i be the first to set off shit, last to run
wu roll together as one
i call my brother son cause he shine like one

yo, aiyyo i got this under my wing, move give me room
holding up your saloon, clean sweep, like a broom
full moons make me howl like a wolf out of breath
sold only new vocal cords you heard genius on gef
so step back, to the lab at, high velocity
my team make hand to hand sales, we're like a pharmacy
fuck geraldo, pablo's plan bro is bravo
goodfellas we know, best sellers become novels
the man rocking head bands, silk scarves and jams
early 80s british walkers, playboys, mocks and shams
the laser beam vocalist does well at symphonies
bad days, watch me snatch ice right outta tiffany's
remember them kids that came off with eight million
robbed the brinks and i labelled in royal pavilions
them flour heads must have been stupid
tell me how the fuck black niggas get caught with all that loot kid
there's jet money, underground money
submarines and rings, too bad you fucked up, dummies


man, i hate rap, but if the shoe fits, wear it
i've become a freak of nature all the kids stare at
who walk around bumpin' raw with the shit blarin'
saying "fuck school " and droppin' out like a miscarriage
i'm embarrassed and i'm ashamed
i played a part in this devilish game
makin' your common sense perish
but i ain't takin' the full blame,  cause most of you chumps runnin' around here ain't never had strict parents
all of your brain cells rottin' from weed
you feelin' like if you ain't got it, life's not as complete
you havin' sex with every motherfuckin' body you see
with a past so dark that satan'd jump out of his seat
but still you out in these streets, thinkin' you hot as can be
without the knowledge to lead, so you just follow the sheep
makin' sure your lame swag is all polished and clean
while your favorite rapper's like, "yeah, he got it from me."
you been brainwashed by a fake life that you're used to livin'
when i say the word "fun," what do you envision?
probably drinkin' and smokin' out with your crew and chillin'
with clueless women you tryin' to bang, bumpin' new edition
is that all you think life really is?
well, if so, then you're a fuckin' idiot
i honestly feel like grabbing your head and hitting it
matter of fact, you don't even deserve a brain   give me it 
do you even have any goals
aside from baggin' these hoes and packin' a bowl?
well, let me guess   no
you're only in school because your parents make you go
when all you do is play beer pong and hang out with the bros
yo, society's got you livin' for a whack cause
you're a fuckin' adult with no skills at all
you don't read any books or play ball
you don't draw   you literally do nothing at all 
still you fiend for the glamorous fruits
you don't have,  cause you idolize rappers that do
and all they say is, "i got money and it's stacked to the roof."
and now you think that it's gon' magically just happen to you?
how? your lazy ass don't commit to labor
you pick somethin' up, try it out, and put it down two minutes later
then you complain about your life  cause it ain't gettin' catered
now whoever tries to call you on your bullshit's a hater?
you wanna succeed, you have to try; or one day you'll get older
and regret it all  cause you can't provide
your friends are lowlives, don't act surprised
look, just cut the bad fruit off of the tree, make the sacrifice

girls, stop actin' like you want a guy
with traits like romeo   bitch, that's a fuckin' lie 
you always talk about how every man's fake and you can't take it
and you want somethin' real   shut up, tramp, save it 
twice a week you put on your makeup and damn bracelets
and head to the club half naked with your ass shakin'
pullin' a lowlife nigga who claim he cash makin'
'til you let him hit and find out he work at the gas station
one of them niggas got you pregnant and you can't raise it
but you caused it, your actions made a fat statement
you want romeo, then act patient
and stop frontin' like he in the club posted in the back waitin'
it's the club, where guys put on a new persona
after they get loaded with a few corona's
they always shoutin' and wild out
with habits that very few condone of
then they look for beautiful brainless bitches like you to bone 'em
then when they leave you, you cry and cry
talkin' about, "oh my god, i can't find a guy 
i've spent so many years and i've tried and tried 
why am i even on earth? i should die "
you want romeo, you're not worthy
you're cock thirsty, you're nasty and probably got herpes
sometimes the secret to finding is to stop searching
try a new formula,  cause your last one's not working

the term "real nigga" is publicly used
and i need to know what it means,  cause i'm fuckin' confused
are you one for always bustin' your tool
with nothin' to lose and somethin' to prove
to homies up in your crew?
is it because you're sellin' drugs to get loot
and brag about how you done been shot and stabbed
like it's fun to be you?
but your life's a struggle, right, and you just hustlin' through?
nah, you hamster ass nigga, you just stuck in a loop
man, why do black people gotta be the only ones who can't evolve?  cause you in the streets actin' like a neanderthal
it's clear you can't stand the law
you're lost as an abandoned dog
and all you're interested in is fightin', rappin' and basketball
i can't even fuck with you
 cause if we out in public, you gon' get caught stealin' some shit, and get my ass in trouble, too
you'll get old and be nothin'
livin' life in these streets, thuggin'
and starting shit with anybody mean muggin'
look at you, a real nigga, thinkin' your life's cool
girls used to turn me down for guys who were like you
'til you grab their heart and shove a spearhead right through
then they regret it because it wasn't the right move
your "real nigga" talk seems bogus
a real nigga don't brag about being real as long as he knows it
and his future doesn't seem hopeless
a real nigga stays out of jail, handles shit and he keeps focused

to all you rappers whose soul is out in the wrong
you inspired the issue i wrote about in this song
you go to prowl on the young who roam around in the slums
see, this is what happens when rap's overcrowded with bums
hope the hour is long when i'm rollin' out with your tongue
the man above is my guide, you know the power is strong
all you menacin' freaks are only in it for cheese
and the mass control limit was breached   fuck hip hop 
they only in it for cheese, and any eyewitness can see
they purposely makin' the innocent weak
my existence on this planet's for you, i ain't only here to benefit me
yo, we need to make a change while there's still time
it is hard, and sometimes i struggle tryin' to reveal mine
i can guide you if you feel blind
i just need you to be willin' to journey into my ill mind


shoo  shoo doo doo doo doo, ah

hopefully i'll be at the top soon
for now i'm at my house on the couch watchin' cartoons
you know how much you love it when you get it in abundance
give a fuck about a budget when you always be the subject of discussion
but it's nothin' when you stop and just say fuck it
 cause you walkin' out in public and you hear them talkin' rubbish

and if she want an autograph she better bring a pen
yeah, the party never end, this life is what i recommend

now that i escape, sleepwalker awake
those who could relate know the world ain't cake
jail bars ain't golden gates, those who fake, they break
when they meet their 400 pound mate
if i could rule the world, everyone would have a gun
in the ghetto of course, when giddyuping on their horse
i kick a rhyme drinking moonshine
i pour a sip on the concrete, for the deceased
but, no, don't weep, wyclef's in a state of sleep
thinking 'bout the robbery that i did last week
money in the bag, banker looked like a drag
i want to play with pellet guns from here to baghdad
gun blast, think fast, i think i'm hit
my girl pinched my hips to see if i still exist
i think not, i'll send a letter to my friends
a born again hooligan only to be king again

ready or not, here i come, you can't hide
gonna find you and take it slowly
ready or not, here i come, you can't hide
gonna find you and make you want me

i play my enemies like a game of chess
where i rest, no stress, if you don't smoke sess
lest i must confess, my destiny's manifest
in some goretex and sweats
i make treks like i'm homeless
rap orgies with porgy and bess
capture your bounty, like elliot ness, yes
bless you if you represent the fu
but i'll hex you with some witch's brew if you're doo doo
voodoo; i can do what you do, easy

crews run for cover, now they're under, pushing up flowers
superfly, true lies, do or die
toss me high, only puff lye with my crew from lakay
i refugee from guantanamo bay
dance around the border, like i'm cassius clay  yes, sir 

ready or not, here i come, you can't hide
gonna find you and take it slowly
ready or not, here i come, you can't hide
gonna find you and make you want me


it was all about you and your homies, that's what it was about with me, me and my homies. making sure everybody eat, making sure everybody's involved, but as you grow, you lose certain homies, because it's called,  closing the gap.  this is the gap, when we start. this is the gap when we start, this is the gap as you grow. this is the gap as you grow. notice how you grow and they don't. so how do you close the gap? you gotta come back down, when you come back down you lose, so you gotta keep going up. that's why closing the gap gotta be them catching up to you, and if they don't catch up you gotta leave them behind

i dream of the day i can go back to when i was born
layin' in your arms, wishin' you was here today, mom
wish you'd appear, just for a second from heaven
my tears would be gone, i wouldn't be rappin' this song
i'd be happy drivin' up to your eight bedroom mansion
up late, laughin' about the hard times we faced
the galaxy is so enchantin' beyond, galileo's understandin'
past the milky way and all the planets
there's somethin' out there greater, but only god knows
scientists claim we came from apes, but they lies though
that was part of our conversation
i spark one up and start blazin'
thinkin' of how amazin' she was, an angel gave me love
i'm thankful to ever know a woman so real
i pray, when i marry, my wife'll have one of your skills
but mom, you could never be replaced
i'd give my life up just to see you one more day, to have 

one more dance with you, momma
if i could only have
one more dance with you, momma
praying, wishing that i could have
one more dance with you, momma
if i could only have
one more dance with you, momma

i wish you were here, i miss you more each second i breathe
you resting in peace, forever, i accepted you free
a blessing to me, i see you dressed in all white
smilin' at me, happy, knowin' everything's all right
if only i could hear your voice and your laughter
just one more time, my chest would be filled up with sunshine
april 7th '02, that's when the gates of heaven opened up
for you to stroll through, beautiful anne jones
job is done, raising ghetto kids in the hood
you was my strength to carry on, and now i'm good
job well done, you lived through your sons and grandchildren
jesus finally got his bride, mommy, dance with him 
and you've been my guide through all the trouble i faced
they playin' our song, the life beat, my hand on your waist
i grab your other hand, i'm tryin' not to step on your toes
spin you around with my eyes closed, dreaming i can have 

one more dance with you, momma
if i could only have
one more dance with you, momma
praying, wishing that i could have
one more dance with you, momma
if i could only have
one more dance with you, momma

i love you forever, mom
you will always live through me, always
uh, uh, uh, yeah


your family looking like a prayer song
your momma at the table cryin
all her hair gone
feeling fishy finding chemo
smoking seaweed for calm
these disney movies too close
you title email "noname thank you for your sweet telefone
it saves lives"
the secret is i'm actually broken
i tried to raise a healing kneeling at the edge of the ocean
somebody, somebody said it saves lives
who holds my hand tonight? i think the glass half full
who pray me back to inglewood, i shouldn't bleed this good holy conundrum
i'm the prayer, the hope, bank account wishin' bone for my loved ones
tell  em noname still don t got no money
tell 'em noname almost passed out drinking
secret is, she really think it saves lives
somebody hit d'angelo, i think i need him on this one
brothers and sisters, mommas, cousins, uncles, everyone
missing somebody
dancing daylight

where i can't pretend

it's like a jungle sometimes
it makes me wonder how i keep from going under
it's like a jungle sometimes
it makes me wonder how i keep from going under

broken glass everywhere
people pissing on the stairs, you know they just don't care
i can't take the smell, can't take the noise
got no money to move out, i guess i got no choice
rats in the front room, roaches in the back
junkies in the alley with a baseball bat
i tried to get away but i couldn't get far
 cause a man with a tow truck repossessed my car

don't push me,  cause i'm close to the edge
i'm trying not to lose my head
it's like a jungle sometimes
it makes me wonder how i keep from going under

standing on the front stoop, hanging out the window
watching all the cars go by, roaring as the breezes blow
crazy lady, living in a bag
eating out of garbage pails, used to be a fag hag
said she'll dance the tango, skip the light fandango
a zircon princess seemed to lost her senses
down at the peep show watching all the creeps
so she can tell her stories to the girls back home
she went to the city and got so so saditty
she had to get a pimp, she couldn't make it on her own

don't push me,  cause i'm close to the edge
i'm trying not to lose my head
it's like a jungle sometimes
it makes me wonder how i keep from going under

my brother's doing bad, stole my mother's tv
says she watches too much, it's just not healthy
all my children in the daytime, dallas at night
can't even see the game or the sugar ray fight
the bill collectors, they ring my phone
and scare my wife when i'm not home
got a bum education, double digit inflation
can't take the train to the job, there's a strike at the station
neon king kong standing on my back
can't stop to turn around, broke my sacroiliac
a mid range migraine, cancered membrane
sometimes i think i'm going insane
i swear i might hijack a plane 

don't push me,  cause i'm close to the edge
i'm trying not to lose my head
it's like a jungle sometimes
it makes me wonder how i keep from going under

my son said, daddy, i don't wanna go to school
 cause the teacher's a jerk, he must think i'm a fool
and all the kids smoke reefer, i think it'd be cheaper
if i just got a job, learned to be a street sweeper
or dance to the beat, shuffle my feet
wear a shirt and tie and run with the creeps
 cause it's all about money; ain't a damn thing funny
you got to have a con in this land of milk and honey
they pushed that girl in front of the train
took her to the doctor, sewed her arm on again
stabbed that man right in his heart
gave him a transplant for a brand new start
i can't walk through the park,  cause it's crazy after dark
keep my hand on my gun,  cause they got me on the run
i feel like a outlaw, broke my last glass jaw
hear them say "you want some more?", living on a see saw

don't push me,  cause i'm close to the edge
i'm trying not to lose my head
it's like a jungle sometimes
it makes me wonder how i keep from going under

a child is born with no state of mind
blind to the ways of mankind
god is smiling on you, but he's frowning too
because only god knows what you'll go through
you'll grow in the ghetto living second rate
and your eyes will sing a song called deep hate
the places you play and where you stay
looks like one great big alleyway
you'll admire all the number book takers
thugs, pimps and pushers and the big money makers
driving big cars, spending twenties and tens
and you'll wanna grow up to be just like them, huh
smugglers, scramblers, burglars, gamblers
pickpocket peddlers, even panhandlers
you say "i'm cool, huh, i'm no fool."
but then you wind up dropping outta high school
now you're unemployed, all null and void
walking 'round like you're pretty boy floyd
turned stick up kid, but look what you done did
got sent up for a eight year bid
now your manhood is took and you're a maytag
spend the next two years as a undercover fag
being used and abused to serve like hell
'til one day you was found hung dead in the cell
it was plain to see that your life was lost
you was cold and your body swung back and forth
but now your eyes sing the sad, sad song
of how you lived so fast and died so young, so...

don't push me,  cause i'm close to the edge
i'm trying not to lose my head
it's like a jungle sometimes
it makes me wonder how i keep from going under

bought me a chevy, got a grill, now i'm gold mouthed
i lost my daddy last year, i couldn't even cry
'cause it's so hard to shed a tear, he didn't even try
the only person in the world i could fully trust
was my older brother vic, that's just how it was
top in the trunk, this for bankroll and slim dunk
i miss that girl beasley, she was a real one
i had an artist that i treated like my own son
gave him the shirt off my back and my own gun
r.i.p. to shawty lo, mister don don
it's been rainin' so long, when the sun comin'?
i'm drop top but put the top up when the storm comin'
sometimes i think about my past, it make me start tripping
i was gifted with a talent that was god given
but i was so hard headed i would not listen
sometimes i sit and i reflect about that cold prison
and doin' pull ups with a nigga got a life sentence
they gave my nigga grant life, he only gained on me
five years later, how we in the same room?
you go to jail, that's when you see who really love you
i don't think nobody love me like my auntie jean do
r.i.p my auntie jean and uncle goat too

if it wasn't for the rain, then the trees won't grow
when the spring came around, what a sight to bestow
when you face adversities, dark clouds won't last
if you never study, how do you expect to pass?
the grasshoppers laid around while the ants did chores
when the winter came around, he was left outdoors
see the cycle keeps moving like a big machine
evolution of the mind, soul body and being
god'll never put upon you more than you can take
sometimes you even gotta learn from other people's mistakes
so head on black people got to meet the task
educate, keep learnin, gotta question, ask 
and let your light keep shinin and remember the past
by any means necessary, we'll be free at last
chorus


it don't have to be too good for you

mad open like earlier in the day you even had oatmeal
so energetic fuel was injected in your artery
soul train dancer honoree
what it looked like then you took flight all of a sudden
but you was just balling or something
then you did the flintstone car pulling for something
out of nowhere
there was a girl on the floor giving you a blank stare
couldn t figure out what the hell was happening
but you was holding slim soph by the abdomen
the way you scurried off looked bad my friend
that must ve been your girl it had to have been and she

seen you on the floor dancing with sophia yo
seen you on the floor dancing with sophia
seen you on the floor dancing with sophia yo
seen you on the floor dancing with sophia

it s only dancing but you was on the floor romancing
spitting in the air and was getting no answer
tapping doing the chant like you was fat man scoop
so to tell you the truth
sophia is a fine specimen that i ve had the honor to know
since the days of a child
she don t intertwine with no ordinary vibe
even though you kick lyrics nice try
there s nothing wrong with being friendly and jovial
the storm will go off and it ll be overdue
don t try to get attached cuz you might get snatched
by the collar by a 40 degree black belt scholar
 

now that s what s happening

talib kweli verse 1:
it's a funky sen sa tion ain't it?
i'm havin a conversation wit'cho imagination
it was explainin how you was waitin, for somethin amazin
like when it come out you out the door racin to the store   zoom  
it took a lot of perse verance and patience
we was preparin for our place among the ancients
yo basically yo' take on me ain't makin me
or breakin me and yo i hate to see a fake mc
i take out all my competition from like a to z
cause i get fly more frequently than a travel agency
that's what i'm made to be, hip hop through my artery
an important part of me the soundtrack to my oddysey
it got me, rockin retardedly
pardon me for speakin incorrect politically
anything less would be me speakin hypocritically, and i don't do dat
you lingerie mc's i see through that
i make a point about you and your crew, go "tru dat"
who dat? it's the reflection
remember the name, slid in the game before the "2000 season" came
breakin the chain, usin the pain as our ammunition
to blast babylonian towers out of position
it's the reflection and we poppin like your ears on a plane
we make you disappear like tears in the rain
the fears in your brain is clear when i appear on the terrain
and bloody your nose
i got more lines than co caine that's why you sniffin' around
we diggin' for different sounds to keep it hittin'
straight up the only way we gettin' down with the sound is provacative
it's for the love and cause of that we got a lot to give

reflection eternal
that's the name don't forget it, talib kweli, dj, hi ti dek
brooklyn  new york city
cin ci natti  keep on 
talib kweli verse 2:
we remain, hotter than the blue part of the flame
i got a glock in my brain
that baffle weapons inspections like saddam hussein
and rocks with the impact
gettin beat with socks filled with ten packs of tokens
men's backs get broken when i get open
words more than spoken
most of dem mc's on the first thing smokin
leavin town at the same time causin traffic on the interstate
we stay droppin classics cause the key word is innovate
these cats is so plastic that we call 'em laminated
tried to duplicate the style quickly got frustrated
more desperate than dudes who search people's ashtrays for clips
i burn mc's like coca cola through the paint on your whip
shit  my rhymes is like a magnifyin glass
when i shine my light through it, i burn up everything in my path
last dragon like lee roy  sho' nuff  rock for the b boy
my rhymes are so sharp you catch cuts that key loid
destroyed the decoy, most of y'all d boy, my culture
it's not that i hate, y'all just p noid cause y'all fake
embarassed and ashamed and don't know where to put the blame
and never hesitate to call out my name 
i ain't effected by the negative
it's the reflection and we dealin with the positive
it's for the love and cause of that we got a lot to give
it's the reflection kid
never gotta look between the lines to get the messages
you're too sensitive, checkin out our references
the turntable and microphone specialist
it's the reflection kid, it's the reflection kid
it's the reflection kid, like that like that
dcq:
talib kweli  talib kweli  dj hi tek  dj hi tek 
break it down, for you and yours  y'all know what time it is 
you fuckin with kweli, you fuckin with brooklyn
 tired of hearin all this  don't wanna hear none of that
 is is my fam really nice.. 

artist: large professor
album: the l.p
song: get off that bullshit
it's getting harder in the streets to survive in '95
it's snakes alive, so black prepare to drive
in the outside lane and bounce on all traffic
niggas in my midst only make me get graphic
detailed description, funk overdose
niggas from coast to coast get that ass ready for the roast
fuck the barbecue
if you're asking how many members is missing it's probably two
i came inside the party to
help you recognise, how every second flys
so the way i'mma sum it up it's time to organise
but before we do that part, some of us got to get
our minds together and get off the bullshit
i watch the white watch the red and blue fight all night
on the american flag another gang banger bag
we're loosing at a rate that's tragic, peace to my man ryan o
as round the way we called him magic
a brother who just wanted to chill and play ball
light skin, was ye tall, he used to say 'paul'
'you coming out with something?', i used to say 'no doubt'
he wasn't into dumbing out or fronting
and to my other brother man who used to call me 'yankee'
i got enough problems with the people that don't thank me
when i hold the door, we in the same hall on the same side
that's why some times i got to slide
cos my own be flipping
step up in my path and get hit by a mental ass whipping
get off that bullshit
when opportunity knocks you got to answer nowadays
to make power plays we must change our ways
and use all the resources that life has to offer
strong will survive, weak will get softer
so get offa the bullshit is the name of the poem
to the metronome, take it one time to the dome
as the right type of hype kid, you know i'm legit
with my new funk hit, get off the bullshit


i pledge allegiance to myself
food, shelter, and health
let me find a beach full of seashells to sell
put your oxygen mask on first before you offer me help
i've got receipts made of scar tissue
got the vision of somebody going fishing in the dark
when i start up the motor, it still turns over
but nowadays, a little bit slower
never been afraid of getting older
i'm much more nervous about these public servants
kill the lights and shut the curtains
you ain't a real lion if you love the circus
looking at myself like, "what's the purpose?"
that's when i started to hallucinate
tryna touch the surface and recuperate
you should've seen the look on my face when i was losing my faith
y'all got me feeling hesitation, embarrassment
i might be the last generation of grandparents
i know that i've been fortunate for all the opportunities
disproportionately disappointed in the human beings
i get it, we're specks of dust
at the bus stop busking for extra crust
like fuck it, you can sacrifice me to the weather
if you promise that you'll let my songs live forever

you're looking for a bag of tricks
but my love is like a stack of bricks
cobblestones and untreated lumber
i'm a father of fists, strength in numbers
and when they come for my box of dreams
i'ma finally depart from this toxic scene
no posturing, just lots of self esteem
got you feeling like the popular queen
this ain't magic, this is fabric
and it's the type that never requires patches
and it's the fire that illustrates with ashes
it's our life, it's nothing we can't manage
lower the arrow and take a breath
i won't waste ammo aiming at the angel of death
i might have already left, but they hear me still
with my pale knuckle grip on a steering wheel


lil' fish
they call me lil' fish 'cause i be swimming in that pussy

should i assume you didn't mean it like that?
or should i assume you know exactly how you said it?
you know exactly how you meant it
should i assume it's me, sweet disposition
switchin' position, duckin' submission
or should i assume it's a weekend thing, boy?
you could get ass all week, droppin' that ass
just think about me, think about me

and it sounds good, what's the difference if it sound good?
split the difference if it's still good
what's the difference if it's still good
just not yours exclusively?
used to be all good
trade it up, now it's all bad
rang it up, credit all bad

sometimes i keep you in my mind
sometimes i let you go up high

tied up


since day one i said fuck the fame and everything it dealt
but the fame is really here just to facilitate the wealth
but the wealth attracts you haters like mosquitos to a well
and the waters getting deeper so i must set out to sail
someone called my cell, and left a voicemail
they said congratulations on the million record sales
as i'm flippin over furniture, knockin' shit off the shelf
i told myself i'd never get too deep to take a breath but i'm sinkin

and it's so hard to breathe, yeah
and even more so to sleep when no one cares
it was all i could need
but now i'm sinking, so deep, i can't come up for air

yeah, i've seen the valley of the shadow of death
i've seen the mountains, a wild childhood
that's why i sing about it
i just try to move on and keep my peace about it
but come to think about it i can't even count the days
that i spent starvin' tryin' to find a some decent housing
it's why i'm always smiling but on this beat i seem so violent
so ask me about the music scene and what the fuck i think about it
time flies i guess that's why i'm buggin
just yesterday i was rappin with my brother and my cousin
if you had the stove or toaster on you couldn't use the oven
we knew that we were struggling we just actin like we wasn't
it was either make it rapping, if not that then hustling
so all i see is magazine covers in this game
you either surface or you plummet
it's a thin line and i'm just tryin to keep my head above it, damn

and it's so hard to breathe, yeah
and even more so to sleep when no one cares
it was all i could need
but now i'm sinking, so deep, i can't come up for air
air i  i sink away 
air  i sink away 
air  as i sink away  i  damn i sink away 
damn air damn pots and pans
get carried away damn get carried away it
was never in the plans
but hey, it's long way from beatin' pots and pans

and it's so hard to breathe, yeah
and even more so to sleep when no one cares
it was all i could need
but now i'm sinking, so deep, i can't come up for air
damn it was never in the plans
but hey, it's a long way from beatin' pots and pans
but now i'm sinking so deep i can't come up for air, air, ah


nigga, you need to git up, git out and git something
don't let the days of your life pass by
you need to git up, git out and git something
don't spend all your time tryna get high
you need git up, git out and git something
how will you make it if you never even try?
you need to git up, git out and git something
cause you and i got to do for you and i

i don't recall, ever graduating at all
sometimes i feel i'm just a disappointment to y'all
every day i just lay around then i can't be found
always asking "gimme some," living life like a bum
times is rough, my auntie got enough problems of her own
nigga, you supposed to be grown
i agree, i try to be the man i'm 'posed to be
but negativity is all you seem to ever see
i admit, i've done some dumb shit, and i'm probably gon' do some mo'
you shouldn't hold that against me though
 why not?  why not? my music's all that i got
but some time must be invested for this to be manifested
i know you know but i'm gon' say this to you, i
get high but i don't get too high
so what's the limit 'posed to be?
that must be why you can't get yo ass up out the bed before three
you need to git up, git out, cut that bullshit out
ain't you sick and tired of having to do without?
damn, what up with all these questions?
you act as though you know something i don't, do you have any suggestions?
cause every job i get is cruel and demeaning
sick of taking trash out and toilet bowl cleaning
but i'm also sick and tired of struggling
i never ever thought i'd to have resort to drug smuggling
naw, that ain't what i'm about
cee lo will just continue traveling his route
without any doubt or fear
i know the lord ain't brought me this far so he could drop me off here
did i make myself clear?

you need to git up, git out and git something
don't let the days of your life pass by
you need to git up, git out and git something
don't spend all your time tryna get high, nigga
you need git up, git out and git something
how will you make it if you never even try?
you need to git up, git out and git something
cause you and i got to do for you and i
that's why

well, uh, get up, stand up, so what's said, you dickhead?

my mama made me do it but the devil, he made me smart
told me to jack them weak ass niggas for they fucking starters
in the middle school, i was a bigger fool
i wore with tank tops to show off my tattoo, thought i was cool
i used to hang out with my daddy's brothers, i call them my uncles
they taught me how to smoke herb, i followed them when they ran numbers
so in a sense, i was rosemary's baby
and then i learned the difference between a bitch and a lady
hell, i treat 'em all like hoes, see i pimped 'em
bitch never had my money so i never whipped 'em
see all the playas came and all the playas went
a playa ain't a gangsta but a playa can handle his shit, bitch
you need to git up, git out, git something
smoke out cause it's all about money, money, money

a lot of people in my past tried to do me, screw me
throw me over in the fire, let me get chunky and charred
like a piece of wood and them spirits got the mutant's mind
i'm getting paranoid and steady looking for the time
it's eight in the morning and ain't nobody up yet
i got my long johns, get my coat and throw on my ball cap
i'm headed out the door, to get off in my ride
i'm digging through the ashtray, hoping to have a good day
i had jamaica's best and when i light it up, i hear a voice in my head
 you got to git up, git out and git something 
now i know it's on, my day is finally started
back up in my crib, eat my shit, break out quick, in my slick
'84 sedan deville, steady bouncing
out the point to campbellton road
the valley of the southside flow
everybody know about that killa that we call blow, so
keep your eyes peeled for the cobra unit
cause they known for jumping out of black chevy trucks and through the fog
here come the red dogs, i'm busting out around the corner in my hog
dipping from the area, i'm scared
so one of these bitches might wind up dead, cause i have no time for jail
fuck clampett cops, fuck elgin bell
and crooked ass jackson, got the whole country
thinking that my city is the big lick for '96
'94, big gipp, goodie mo
outkast, a vision from the past
hootie hoo 
my white owls are burning kind of slow

you need to git up, git out and git something
don't let the days of your life pass by
you need to git up, git out and git something
don't spend all your time tryna get high nigga
you need git up, git out and git something

ain't nobody black running but crac kers, so, why
i got to register? i thinking of better shit to do with my time
never smelled aroma of diploma, but i write the deep ass rhymes
so let me take y'all way
back to when a nigga stayed in southwest atlanta, ay
y'all could not tell me nothing, thought i hit that bottom rock
at age 13, start working at the loading dock
they laying my mama off of work, general motors tripping
but i come home banked like hank, from licking and dipping
doing dumb shit, not knowing what a nigga know now
yeah, that petty shit will have you cased up and locked down
i dips, over to east point still actin' a fool
wasting my time in the school, i'd rather be shooting pool
cool is how i played the tenth grade
i thought it was all about macking hoes and wearing pimp fade
instead of being in class, i'd rather be up in some ass
not thinking about them six courses that i need to pass
graduation rolled around like rolly pollies
damn, that's fucked up, i should've listened when my mama told me
that, if you play now, you gonna suffer later
figured she was talking yang yang so i payed her no attention
and kept missing the point she tried to poke me with
the doper that i get, the more i'm feeling broke as shit
huh, but that don't matter though, i am an o u t kast
so get up off your ass

you need to git up, git out and git something
don't let the days of your life pass by
you need to git up, git out and git something
don't spend all your time tryna get high
you need git up, git out and git something
how will you make it if you never even try?

 and you know 
it's like that and a, a hieroglyphics, yeah
 together  hiero, y'all...

it's not a wrong thing
to be addicted to the microphone like a heron fiend
i'll tell you one thing:
you'll never catch me fronting
as i proceed to give the people what they wanting
you're making some green...
but not for glamour or fashion
i'm stacking cash until i can get moms a mansion
all from rapping?
nah, man, there's many plans
like investing in land
it started all from impressing the fans
with brand new flows
and you know
all the way from gangsta clones to weirdos
fools used those
but we ain't tripping
give respect when you see this
you need us
or your rhymes underdeveloped like a fetus

those that know not doze
and it shows
when we broke out the knock
hoes hopped out they clothes
that's positive feedback
yep, the prose
i'm poised, we never pose, you'll never know
from '93 til infinity we've been inventive
creating the bump is our only incentive
and it's been a long time since i feel i've been felt
but the only thing i fear is fear itself
so you know what we gots to do
maybe could we keep it within the crew
like it should be?
never givin' out
we're livin' out our dreams
if there's something i can't live without
that's my team
you never knew...

hieroglyphics
hip hop is vintage
underground like silos
launching long range ballistics
world renowned, we ground breaking
musical boundaries
runnin' circles around emcees
 you never knew 
it's like that and a, a hieroglyphics, yeah
 and you know 
it's like that and a, a hieroglyphics, yeah
 you never knew 
it's like that and a, a hieroglyphics, yeah
 and you know 
it's like that and a, a hieroglyphics, yeah
it's like...

del, been rhyming for more than a decade
onto the next stage, while emcees need aid
stay paid, i'm still grade a
none of that tomfoolery
as you can see this shit ain't nothing new to me
utterly hovering over other things material
you're stuck in the here and now
plus you're sweating profusely, here's a towel
your fears are now reality
when i take your dream states
and elaborate on how your team's fake
like phony ids, but sometimes i feel like
only i see through the charade you've made
in today, but hey, tomorrow it's played
and then they got a new fool in your place to be okayed

hieroglyphics
hip hop is vintage
invented in days back
rekindling in ways that many thought was lost
in this contemporary maze of methods to floss
we finding trees and trails to blaze
boundaries to cross
we can be found beyond the bounds of reason
or earthbound, heatin' up the coliseum

they rushed the stage full throttle in chicago
our brains interlocked
where fakin' emcees get caught with the 40 bottle
or get their chains snatched, pronto
we unstoppable, droppin' flows in toronto
maneuverin' through vancouver and on to japan
where they put major grands in my hand
follow...

straight from the heart we set apart from the rest an'
our perfection on the microphone was predestined
world renowned, we ground breaking
musical boundaries
runnin' circles around emcees
 you never knew 
it's like that and a, a hieroglyphics, yeah
 and you know 
it's like that and a, a hieroglyphics, yeah
 you never knew 
it's like that and a, a hieroglyphics, yeah
 and you know 
it's like that and a, a hieroglyphics, yeah
it's like...

it's like that, a hieroglyphics, yeah
it's like..
a hieroglyphics, yeah
it's like. yeah 



yeah, yeah
ayo, black, it's time, word  word, it's time, man 
it's time, man  aight, man, begin 
yeah, straight out the fuckin' dungeons of rap
where fake niggas don't make it back
i don't know how to start this shit, yo... now

rappers   i monkey flip 'em with the funky rhythm i be kickin'
musician, inflictin', composition
of pain, i'm like scarface sniffin' cocaine
holdin' an m16, see with the pen i'm extreme
now, bullet holes left in my peepholes
i'm suited up in street clothes, hand me a 9 and i'll defeat foes
y'all know my steelo, with or without the airplay
i keep some e j, sittin' bent up in the stairway
or either on the corner bettin' grants with the cee lo champs
laughin' at base heads, tryna sell some broken amps...
g packs get off quick, forever niggas talk shit
reminiscin' about the last time the task force flipped
niggas be runnin' through the block shootin'
time to start the revolution, catch a body, head for houston
once they caught us off guard, the mac 10 was in the grass, and
i ran like a cheetah, with thoughts of an assassin
picked the mac up, told brothers "back up "   the mac spit
lead was hittin' niggas, one ran, i made him backflip
heard a few chicks scream, my arm shook, couldn't look
gave another squeeze, heard it click, "yo, my shit is stuck "
tried to cock it, it wouldn't shoot, now i'm in danger
finally pulled it back and saw 3 bullets caught up in the chamber
so, now i'm jettin' through the buildin' lobby
and it was full of children, prob'ly couldn't see as high as i be
 so, what you sayin'? 
it's like the game ain't the same
got younger niggas pullin' the triggers, bringin' fame to their name
and claim some corners, crews without guns are goners
in broad daylight, stick up kids, they run up on us
0.45 s and gauges, mac's in fact
same niggas will catch you back to back, snatchin' your cracks in black
there was a snitch on the block gettin' niggas knocked
so hold your stash 'til the coke price drop
i know this crackhead who said she got to smoke nice rock
and if it's good she'll bring you customers and measuring pots, but yo
you gotta slide on a vacation
inside information keeps large niggas erasin' and their wives basin'
it drops deep as it does in my breath
i never sleep, 'cause sleep is the cousin of death
beyond the walls of intelligence, life is defined
i think of crime when i'm in the new york state of mind

new york state of mind
new york state of mind
new york state of mind

be havin' dreams that i'm a gangsta, drinkin' mo ts, holdin' tec's
makin' sure the cash came correct, then i stepped
investments in stocks, sewin' up the blocks to sell rocks
winnin' gunfights with mega cops
but just a nigga walkin' with his finger on the trigger
make enough figures until my pockets get bigger
i ain't the type of brother made for you to start testin'
give me a smith   wesson, i have niggas undressin'
thinkin' of cash flow, buddha and shelter
whenever frustrated, i'ma hijack delta
in the pj's, my blend tape plays, bullets are strays
young bitches is grazed, each block is like a maze
full of black rats trapped plus the island is packed
from what i hear in all the stories when my peoples come back
black, i'm livin' where the nights is jet black
the fiends fight to get crack, i just max, i dream i can sit back
and lamp like capone, with drug scripts sewn
or the legal luxury life, rings flooded with stones, homes
i got so many rhymes, i don't think i'm too sane
life is parallel to hell, but i must maintain
and be prosperous, though we live dangerous
cops could just arrest me, blamin' us: we're held like hostages
it's only right that i was born to use mics
and the stuff that i write is even tougher than dykes
i've taken rappers to a new plateau
through rap slow, my rhymin' is a vitamin held without a capsule
the smooth criminal on beat breaks
never put me in your box if your shit eats tapes
the city never sleeps, full of villains and creeps
that's where i learned to do my hustle, had to scuffle with freaks
i'm a addict for sneakers, 20s of buddha and bitches with beepers
in the streets i can greet ya, about blunts i teach ya
inhale deep like the words of my breath
i never sleep 'cause sleep is the cousin of death
i lay puzzle as i backtrack to earlier times
nothing's equivalent to the new york state of mind

new york state of mind
new york state of mind
new york state of mind
new york state of mind

"nasty nas "

goin' through the emotions of gun holdin'
long shotgun's down my pants leg, limpin'
killa b, you still livin', even my pops too
he taught me how to shoot when i was seven
i used to bust shots crazy, i couldn't even look
because the loud sound used to scare me
i love my pops for that, i love my niggaty black
i'll take the life of anybody tryin' to change what's left
and through all of that a nigga ain't scared of death
all y'all brand new niggas just scared to death
i spent too many nights sniffin' coke, gettin' right
wastin' my life, now i'm tryin' to make things right
grand open some gates, invest in the rag business

fully blown melanin tone
i rock skeleton bone shirts and verses
but thirst for worse beats
so i can put more product out on the street

while the rest of y'all niggas just nil

and chicken wings under seasoned
y'all really thought a bitch couldn't rap huh?
maybe this your answer for that, a crack era
the reagan administration that niggas are still scared of
nah actually this is for me
this one for tt at the lake serving the mac and the cheese
this one a small apology for all the calls that i screened

mr. money man, mr. every day he got me
mr. wifing me down, mr. me love, mr. miyagi
miscellaneous, mr. molly inside my sake
incredible, incredible emptiness in my body
heaven's only four feet tall, i set my ringer to it
fucked your rapper homie, now his ass is making better music
my pussy teachin ninth grade english
my pussy wrote a thesis on colonialism
in conversation with a marginal system in love with jesus
and y'all still thought a bitch couldn't rap huh?
maybe this your answer for that good pussy
i know niggas only talk about money and good pussy



envisioning the hereafter, listening to steve wonder
on a quest for love like the proceed drummer
i strike like lightning and don't need thunder
inhale imagination and breathe wonder
that's your lady, i used to run up in her and g weed from her
it's a cold world and niggas need summer
at times my going forward seems like retreat
as i rewrite rhyme after rhyme and throw away beats
growing into my britches, outgrowing the streets
there's a thin line between war and peace, whores and jeeps
ignore mcs like beeps, scribbling freedom on pages
my third eye is like pink eye, seen and contagious
redeeming the ancients with ageless rhyme jargon
i feel mexican, hip hop is my garden
don't give a fuck where you charting, certain shit i can't honor
it ain't that you selling, it's your karma
rappers i monitor like a chaperone, you large and haven't grown
poetically perform live bys, another rapper gone
the stage becomes a catacomb, i rap like a mummy
not for the money, i could have sampled diana ross a long time ago
my mind of flow is like motor key 20
youngblood said he had dimes, i prayed that he see twenty
hollering at the brothers, either you gon' be a thug or a man
flip drugs and get land
i can see my man was tired as he described how the bucks hit him
and said slugs was still stuck in him, when it rained, it fucked with him
this bucket interrupt wisdom and asked when my album was coming
i said it's here, it's here...

i'm still as sick as a malaria patient, i'm very impatient
stomping up the stairs of the basement  i'm coming 
no hibernation, yo, this bear is awakened
and half the game be softer than what ben and jerry are making
i'm a transcendentalist with literary arrangements
vocabulary is like a dictionary replacement
but they only talking money and they last time i was checking
the greater percentage of america is in a recession  hold up   what 
so what you're sayin' is these diamond crusted necklaces
and convoluted messages is really what you're messing with
where's the dope shit what happened to that
back when people stepped up to the mic and actually rapped
but now i'm on it, been here for a minute, and now i'm back to get them
had this devil on my shoulder during catechism
staying high from the purple and the hash i'm hitting
brain moving slower than rick ross' metabolism
i'm here to rap a rhythm, so why you saying shit  why 
so many fucking punch lines, i'm about to break my wrist
undefeated, yo, i'm hard to be playing with
i'm the king, alter alias is marcus aurelius
killing beats, murder scene, and i'm washing my hands carefully
scrubbing all the blood out the trunk of the grand cherokee
in need of therapy but the doctor's scared of me
says i need a trip to shutter island cuz apparently
i've lost my damn mind,yo, i'm sick in the head
the reason women say that chivalry's dead
i'm that guy, trying to find some company laying in misery's bed
staying blunted with a fifth to the head
judge dredd with a weapon now, laser beam flow bout to blast that
mother fucking lyricist, you can hashtag that
freestyle crazy, they like; "yo, how he rap that?"
so hot off the top, i'll melt the plastic in my snapback
in a hatchback running people over till your body parts are stuck in my motor
never sober, i got to charge my g pen like 12 times every weekend
sharks and minnows with it always treading in the deep end, shit who needs friends
i got my headphones, an ipod, rhyme book and a pen, homes
shit, i even got bars in a dead zone
i get it crackin' like chiropractors with neck bones
shit, i been slept on, way too fucking long now
studied every fork in the road taking the long route  yes sir 
mapped it out like cartography, build my bridges strong
and now i know that anyone that stomps at me will tremble in my hands
run them off my lands, see i always stuck it to the man
fuck it, cuz i can, bringing out the ruckus is my plan
puffing on a gram, if you want some trouble i'm your man
comfortably stand right where i'm at
soon to be legend, ain't no fighting the facts
about to rise to be a mother fucking titan of rap
give them pieces of my soul and put my life in a track
in the game where people quick to put that knife in your back
gotta teach yourself to move like a wolf or get preyed on
fuck blowing up the real challenge is to stay on
you must be fucking stupid if you take on
this crazy white boy, keep my game face on
and my shades on, and my brim low, and my mind right
cooking up a sick flow, chewing through my leash, now see the kid go
because now we here bitch, welcome to the show



tell my momma i'm a shaman rhymin'
jesus christ and shawn carter are my only idols
no, jesus christ and shawn carter are my only rivals
i'm the messiah of rap, my catalog's the bible
to the new generation of lost souls
student loans, iphones, reality tv shows
it shows a host of wise, but blind drones
post babylonia, so i'm told
it could be bologna, so i don't hold it to be fact
just tryna put the pieces together, puzzled by this madness
if that dollar crashes, niggas gone panic, what we gon' do?
how we gon eat? don't even know how to grow fruit detached from your roots, nigga, me too
i'm doing drugs, fornicating and eating fast food
but i know i got three eyes cause i'm looking past you

enter the void
this for my hundred dollar billers to destroy
spreading word of knowledge to through decoys
people realize that it's time to deploy
stay on point: open your third eye, boy
 and keep your motherfucking chakras open
keep your motherfucking chakras open
keep your mouth shut and keep your motherfucking chakras open
keep your all seeing eye open 

had to escape nest, told moms i'm apex
and plus i lay checks, i bust in the latex
so it's nothing stopping the kid if you get where i come from
busting conundrums on nuns and condoms
don't want no problems, it's the number one solver

he greets his father with his hands out
rehabilitated slightly, but glad to be the man's child
the world is different since he's seen it last
out of jail, been seven years and he's happy that he's free at last
all he had was his mother's letters
now he's mobile and he's gotta make a change and make it for the better
but he's black so he's got one strike against him
and he's young, plus he came up in the system
but he's smart and he's finally making eighteen
and his goal's to get on top and try to stay clean
so he's calling up his homie who done came up
livin' lavish, now they dealin' with the same stuff
and had that attitude that who he was was worth land
and with that fucked up attitude he killed his first man
now it's different, he done did dirt
and realized killin' men meant comin' up but it still hurt
and can't nobody change this
it's 1994 and we up against the same shit
i never understood why
i could never see a man cry 'til i seen a man die

imagine life at it's full peak
then imagine lying dead in the arms of your enemy
imagine peace on this earth when there's no grief
imagine grief on this earth when there's no peace
everybody's got a different way of endin' it
and when your number comes for souls, then they send it in
now your time has arrived for your final test
i see the fear in your eyes and hear your final breath
how much longer will it be 'til it's all done?
total darkness at ease be at all one
i watch him die and when he dies let us celebrate
you took his life, but your memory you'll never take
you'll be headed to another place
and the life you used to live will reflect in your mother's face
i still gotta wonder why
i never seen a man cry 'til i seen a man die

i hear you breathin' but your heart no longer sounds strong
but you kinda scared of dying so you hold on
and you keep on blacking out and your pulse is low
stop trying to fight the reaper, just relax and let it go
because there's no way you can fight it though you'll still try
and you can try it 'til you fight it but you'll still die
your spirits leave your body and your mind clears
the rigor mortis starts to set, now you outta here
you start your journey into outer space
you see yourself in the light but you're still feeling outta place
so you standing in the tunnel of eternal life
and you see the ones you never learn to love in life
make the choice, let it go if you can back it up
if you ain't at peace with god you need to patch it up
but if you ready, close your eyes and we can set it free
here lies a man not scared to die, may he rest in peace
i still got to wonder why
i never seen a man cry 'til i seen that man die

 right  right  
check me out y'all
nasty nas in your area
about to cause mass hysteria

before a blunt, i take out my fronts
then i start to front, matter of fact i be on a manhunt
you couldn't catch me in the streets without a ton of reefer
that's like malcolm x catchin' the jungle fever
king poetic, too much flavor, i'm major
atlanta ain't brave r, i'll pull a number like a pager
 cause i'm an ace when i face the bass
40 side is the place that is givin' me grace
now wait, another dose and you might be dead
and i'm a nike head, i wear chains that excite the feds
and ain't a damn thing gonna change, i'm a performer, strange
so the mic warmer was born to gain
nas, why did you do it?
you know you got the mad phat fluid when you rhyme
it's halftime

 right   it's halftime
 right   ayo it's halftime
 right   it's halftime
 right   yeah, it's about halftime
this is how it feel, check it out, how it feel

it's like that, you know it's like that
i got it hemmed, now you never get the mic back
when i attack, there ain't a army that could strike back
so i react never calmly on a hype track
i set it off with my own rhyme
 cause i'm as ill as a convict who kills for phone time
i'm max like cassettes, i flex like sex
in your stereo sets, nas'll catch wreck
i used to hustle, now all i do is relax and strive
when i was young i was a fan of the jackson 5
i drop jewels, wear jewels, hope to never run it
with more kicks than a baby in a mother's stomach
nasty nas has to rise  cause i'm wise
this is exercise 'til the microphone dies
back in '83 i was an mc sparkin'
but i was too scared to grab the mics in the parks and
kick my little raps  cause i thought niggas wouldn't understand
and now in every jam i'm the fuckin' man
i rap in front of more niggas than in the slave ships
i used to watch "chips", now i load glock clips
i got to have it, i miss mr. magic
versatile, my style switches like a faggot
but not bisexual, i'm an intellectual
of rap i'm a professional, and that's no question yo
these are the lyrics of the man, you can't near it, understand?
 cause in the streets i'm well known like the number man
am i in place with the bass and format?
explore rap and tell me, "nas ain't all that."
and next time i rhyme, i be foul
whenever i freestyle i see trial, niggas say i'm wild
i hate a rhyme biter's rhyme
stay tuned, i assume, the real rap comes at halftime

 right   it's halftime
 right   exhale, check it, it's halftime
 right   it's halftime
 right   it's real in the field
word life, check it

i got it goin' on, even flip a morning song
every afternoon, i kick half the tune
and in the darkness i'm heartless like when the narc's hit
word to marcus garvey, i hardly sparked it
 cause when i blast the herb, that's my word
i be slayin' them fast, doin' this that and the third
but chill, pass the andre, and let's slay
i bag bitches up at john jay and hit a matinee
puttin' hits on 5 0
 cause when it's my time to go, i wait for god with the .44
and biters can't come near
and yo, go to hell to the foul cop who shot garcia
i won't plant seeds, don't need an extra mouth i can't feed
that's extra phillie change, more cash for damp weed
this goes out to manhattan, the island of staten
brooklyn and queens is livin' fat and
the boogie down, enough props, enough clout
ill will, rest in peace, yo i'm out

 right   it's still halftime
 right   to the queensbridge crew
to the queensbridge crew, you know it's halftime
 right   ninety two, it's halftime
 right   yo police, police man, yo let's get ghost
halftime 


i'm out to bomb like vietnam under the same name tame one
the bad one, ink flow master bastard with the magnum
i tags up quick and then i steps to the exit
when it's time to get sefted or flex on some fresh shit
some wack crook stole my black book i know who took it
i know his whole tag because the fag writes his name crooked
the ink i use might stink but you gotta think
i got my props hoppes 'cause my tags don't shrink
i'm tagging and bagging bitches cause my name is famous in the street
'cause they know my name's from cruising in the jeeps
so yo grab a can and put your man up and stand up
for the fresh never stale niggas off the third rail
deep dark and black like the magnum i pack
it's that artifacts chat from the wrong side of da tracks

the artifacts are from the wrong, side of da tracks
the artifacts are from the wrong side

i load my backpack with spray paints and markers to spark the
tag i never drip, i catch the path, take a trip
to the train yards and think back, when i used to write that
shit that used to hit, had all the mad color tips
breaking was my thing i used to spin the back
i never thought i'd spin the wax with tracks to make your hands clap
i could've went the other way but no haps
i got my dap on the map with the bic down to a spray cap
niggas used to doubt to my clout but now i turn em out
they shout my shout out uptown like they wanna be down
avoid the crowds that wanna stab me in the back enough of that
watch the third rail track 'cause i don't wanna get zapped
pieces i burn to show my name no shame
don't wanna put the blame down on my nigga tame
brothers don't wanna see me grow to get my cash flow
i have no remorse, so check me out in the source

the artifacts are from the wrong, side of da tracks
the artifacts are from the wrong side

i burn my name up quick like a thai stick
as red as my eyes get i still rocks the fly shit
back with some ultra flat black catchin wreck in a sec
wet paint, ain't shit, when i'm on the set
i'm live like the third rail, on time like a path train
the name tame alone got fame so fuck a last name
i tags mad when i drag a fat sack of ism
comin out with new editions like mike bivins
i get a sticker from my nigga with the bag of em
write my name on em then i peel off the back of em
and stick em to victims of underground systems
let the toys bring the noise, me and my boys are gonna diss em
in conclusion don't snooze when two niggas from the jerz
kick the mad graffiti slurs and kick the bass to the curb
the artifacts jack, bringin the art of facts back
some seem to forget about the ebony that caught wreck
so remember this you're tender when you slip in to enter
the artifacts zone cause graffiti's still prone
to kick ass pizazz slash let me tag
why is that black? because the wack jack was known as a fag
so don't cross the path that's the gat to your back
the artifacts out, wrong side of da tracks

the artifacts are from the wrong, side of da tracks
the artifacts are from the wrong side

friday night and i need a fight
my motorcycle and a switchblade knife

we used to be number 10, now we're permanent one
in the battle lost my finger, mic became my arm
pistol nozzle hits your nasal, blood becomes lukewarm
tell the woman be easy naah squeeze the charmin
test wyclef, see death flesh get scorned
beat you so bad make you feel like you ain't wanna be born jawn
and tell your friends stay the hell out of my lawn
chicken george became dead george stealing chickens from my farm
damn, another dead pigeon;
if you're mafiosos then i'm bringing on haitian sicilians
nobody's shooting, my body's made of hand grenade
girl bled to death while she was tongue kissing a razor blade
that sounds sick maybe one day i'll write a horror;
blackula comes to the ghetto, jacks an acura
stevie wonder sees crack babies
becoming enemies of their own families 
armageddon come you know we soon done
gun by my side just in case i gotta rump
a boy on the side of babylon
trying to front like he's down with mount zion

oooh la la la
it's the way that we rock when we're doing our thang
oooh la la la
it's the natural la that the refugees bring
oooh la la la la la la lalala la laaah
sweeeeet thing

yeah in saloons we drink boone's and battle goons till high noon
bust rap tunes on flat spoons, take no shorts like poom poom's
see hoochies pop coochies, for gucci's and lucci
find me in my mitsubishi, eating sushi, bumping fugees
hey hey hey   try to take the crew and we don't play play
say say say   like paul mccartney, not hardly
odd ly enough, i can see right through your bluff
niggas huff and they puff but they can't handle us, we bust
cause we fortified, i could never hide
seen "cooley high", cried when cochise died
i'm twisted, black listed by some other negroes
don't remove my polos on the first episode
ha ha ha ha, you shouldn't diss refugees, and
ha ha ha ha, you whole sound set's bootie, and
ha ha ha ha, you have to respect jersey
cause i'm superfly when i'm super high
on the fu gee la

oooh la la la
it's the way that we rock when we're doing our thang
oooh la la la
it's the natural la that the refugees bring
oooh la la la la la la lalala la laaah
sweeeeet thing

i sit 90 degrees underneath palm trees
smoking beedi as i burn my calories
brooklyn roof tops become brooklyn tee pees
who that be, enemies, wanna see the death of me
from hawaii to  hawthorne, i run marathons, like
buju banton, i'm a true champion, like

a dedication to all the refugees worldwide
one time, say, say, say

i remember when we used to sit
in the government yard in brooklyn
observing the crookedness
as it mingled with the good people we meet
good friends we had, good friends we've lost along the way
in this great future you can't forget your past
so dry your tears, i say
and to my peeps who passed away

no woman, no cry
no woman, no cry, say, say, say
hey, little sister, don't shed no tears
no woman, no cry, say, say, say

i remember when we used to rock
in a project yard in jersey
and little georgie would make the firelight
as stolen cars passed through the night
and then we'd hit the corner store for roots, paper, and brew
my drink's my only remedy for pain of losing family
but while i'm gone shorty

everything is gonna be alright
everything is gonna be alright
fugees come to the dance tonight
everything is gonna be alright
everything is gonna be alright
everything is gonna be alright
the gun man's in the house tonight
but everything is gonna be alright
oh, ah, oh ah
oh, ah, oh ah
oh, ah, oh ah
oh, ah, oh ah
oh, ah, oh ah
oh, ah, oh ah
oh, ah, oh ah

no woman, no cry
no woman, no cry, say, say, say
hey, little sister, don't shed no tears
no woman, no cry, say, say, say

i remember when we used to sit
in a government yard in trenchtown
observing the hypocrites
as they mingled with the good people we meet
good friends we had, oh, good friends we've lost along the way, hey
in this great future you can't forget your past
so dry your tears i say

no woman, no cry
no woman, no cry, say, say, say
hey, little sister, don't shed no tears
no woman, no cry, say, say, say

and to my peeps who passed away
oh, ah, oh ah
oh, ah, oh ah
oh, ah, oh ah

my ambitions as a ridah
my ambitions as a ridah

so many battlefield scars while driven in plush cars
this life as a rap star is nothin' without guard
was born rough and rugged, addressin' the mass public
my attitude was "fuck it," 'cause motherfuckers love it
to be a soldier, must maintain composure at ease
though life is complicated, only what you make it to be
uh, and my ambitions as a ridah
to catch her while she hot and horny, go up inside her
then i spit some game in her ear, "go to the telly, ho "
equipped with money in a benz 'cause, bitch, i'm barely broke
i'm smokin' bomb ass weed, feelin' crucial
from player to player, the game's tight, the feeling's mutual
from hustlin' and prayers to breakin' motherfuckers to pay up
i got no time for these bitches, 'cause these hoes try to play us
i'm on a meal ticket mission, want a mil' so i'm wishin'
competition got me ripped on that bullshit they stressin'  booyah 
i'ma rhyme though, clown hoes like it's mandatory
no guts, no glory, my nigga, bitch got the game distorted
now it's on and it's on because i said so
can't trust a bitch in the business so i got with death row
now these money hungry bitches gettin' suspicious
started plottin' and plannin' on a scheme to come and twist us
but thug niggas be on point and game tight  yeah 
me, syke and bogart strapped up the same night
got problems, then handle it, motherfuckers see me
these niggas is jealous
'cause deep in the hearts they wanna be me
uh, yeah, and now you got me right beside ya, hopin' you listen
i catch you payin' attention to my ambitions as a ridah

i won't deny it, i'm a straight ridah

but they can't do nothin' to a g
 i won't deny it, i'm a straight ridah 

it was my only wish to rise
above these jealous coward motherfuckers i despise
when it's time to ride, i was the first off this side, give me the 9
i'm ready to die right here tonight and motherfuck they life
that's what they screamin' as they drill me, but i'm hard to kill
so open fire, i see you kill me, witness my steel
 that's all you niggas got? 
spittin' at adversaries, envious and after me
i'd rather die before they capture me, watch me bleed
mama, come rescue me, i'm suicidal, thinkin' thoughts
i'm innocent so there'll be bullets flyin' when i'm caught  shoot 
fuck doin' jail time, better day, sacrifice
won't get a chance to do me like they did my nigga tys
thuggin' for life, and if you right, then nigga die for it
let them other brothers try, at least you tried for it
when it's time to die, to be a man and pick the way you leave
fuck peace and the police, my ambitions as a ridah

i won't deny it, i'm a straight ridah
you don't wanna fuck with me
 my ambitions as a ridah 
got the police bustin' at me
but they can't do nothin' to a g

my murderous lyrics, equipped with spirits of the thugs before me
pay off the block, evade the cops 'cause i know they comin' for me
i been hesitant to reappear, been away for years
now i'm back, my adversaries been reduced to tears
question my methods to switch up speeds
sure as some bitches bleed
niggas'll feel the fire of my mother's corrupted seed
blast me but they didn't finish, didn't diminish my powers
 buck buck buck buck buck 
so now i'm back to be a motherfuckin' menace
they cowards, that's why they tried to set me up
had bitch ass niggas on my team so indeed they wet me up
but i'm back reincarnated, incarcerated
at the time i contemplate the way that god made it
lace 'em with lyrics that's legendary, musical mercenary
for money i'll have these motherfuckers buried
i been gettin' much mail in jail, niggas tellin' me to kill it
knowin' when i get out they gon' feel it
witness the realest, a hoo ridah when i put the shit inside
the cry from all your people when they find ya
just remind ya, my history'll prove authentic
revenge on them niggas that played me
and all the cowards that was down with it
now it's your nigga right beside ya, hopin' you listenin'
catch you payin' attention to my ambitions as a ridah

i won't deny it, i'm a straight ridah
you don't wanna fuck with me
 my ambitions as a ridah 
got the police bustin' at me
but they can't do nothin' to a g
i won't deny it, i'm a straight ridah

got the police bustin' at me
but they can't do nothin' to a g

yo, the saga begins, begin war
i draw first, blood, be the first to set it off
my cause, tap all jaws, lay down laws
we takin' what's yours, we do jux, rush the doors
here come the d's, time to make breeze and gun toss
in full force, my team'll go at your main source
my 9 taurus hit bosses and take hostage
your whole setup, from the ground up, we lock shit
blood flood your eye, fuck up your optics
switch to killer instincts for niggas pop shit
yo, nigga noyd, what's the topic? nine pound we rocked in
'96 strike back with more hot shit
illuminate, my team'll glow like radiation
with no time for patient or complication, let's get it
done right, my clique airtight, trapped in a
never ending gunfight so niggas lose stripes or lose life
jail niggas sending kites to the street
over some beef that wasn't fully cooked, finish 'em off
well done meat, then send 22 slug to your head
travel all the way down to your leg

ayo, it's hell on earth, whose necks are gonna be first?
the projects is front line
and the enemy is one time, i ain't gotta tell you
it's right in front of your eyes
ayo, it's hell on earth, whose necks are gonna be first?
the projects is front line
and the enemy is one time, i ain't gotta tell you
yo, it's right in front of your eyes

we rep the qbc, nigga, rep yours, it's all love
milli stacked down, heavily guarded by hollow tip slug
then crack down on wannabe thugs, adapt to gat sound
and bow down, slow the fuck up, see how my foul now
articulate, hittin' body parts to start shiftin' shit
never hesitant, it's the rap game unlimited
sign my roster, we can do this, forever infinite
then reminisce, 20 years later how we was gettin' it
either with me, go against the grain, you better hit me
leggin' me or robbin' me, niggas better body me
 cause it's a small world, and niggas talkin' like bitches
bitches singin' like snitches, pointin' you out in pictures
 cause she rep the qbc faithfully, playa hatin' me
all that bullshit is just makin' me
more the better, then concentrate on gettin' cheddar
if shorty set you up, you better dead her, i told you
shape and mold you, son you, then i hold you
like a pimp, mind control you, double edge blow you
it'll be i like i'm supposed to, the clique is coastal
international, you local bacardi mix physically fix
hit you with shit that'll leave a loose nigga stiff
probably thick, son, i solved 'em
pulled him in my world then evolved him to chaos
walk the beat like, around the way cops the average pitstop
qb city godfather pt iii
gotti, gambino and ty nitty, scarface
rest in peace 

whose necks are gonna be first?
the projects is front line
and the enemy is one time, i ain't gotta tell you
ayo, it's right in front of your eyes
hell on earth, whose necks are gonna be first?
the projects is front line
and the enemy is one time, i ain't gotta tell you
ayo, it's right in front of your eyes

yo, the heavy metal king, hold big shit with spare clips
you see an eclipse when the mac spit, your top got split
layin' dead with open eyes, close his eyelids
turn off his lights, switch to darkness  cause deep in the abyss is
street life, blood on my kicks, shit on my knife
you's the wild child, kiko turnin' men into mice
i was born to take power, leave my mark on this planet
the phantom of crime rap, niggas is left stranded
shut down your operation, closed for business
leave a foul taste in your mouth like guinness
pow niggas is found mia
we move like special forces, green beret
heavily around my throat, i don't play
shit brand new, back in '89, the same way
the god p walk with a limp see, but simply
to simplify shit, no man can go against me
test me, you must be bent, g, don't tempt me
i had this full clip for so long, it needs to empty
the reason why it's full for so long  cause i don't waste shit
you properly hit, blood in your mouth, so you could taste it
quiet as kept, i lay back and watch the world spin
i hear thugs claimin' that they gonna rob the mobb when they
see us, i tell you what black, here's the issue, it's a
package deal, you rob me, you take these missiles
along with that, i ain't your average cat
fuck rap, i'm tryna make cream, and that's that
whatever it takes, however, it gots to go down
four mics on stage, a motherfuckin' four pound
speakers leakin' out sound and niggas leakin' on the ground
i could truly care less, the god gon' get his
regardless blow for blow, let's find out who wear hardest
this rap artist used to be a stickup artist
sometimes i test myself, see if i still got it
a live nigga stay on point, never diss
regard shit or forget the essence from which i emerged
p is sick, so save that bullshit for the birds
live up to my word, if i got beef, niggas comin' in herds
we flush through, your clique get purged

i met a gypsy and she hipped me to some life game
to stimulate then activate the left and right brain
said, "baby boy, you only funky as your last cut
you focus on the past, your ass'll be a 'has what'"
that's one to live by or either that's one to die to
i try to just throw it at you, determine your own adventure
andr , got to her station, here's my destination
she got off the bus, the conversation lingered in my head
for hours, took a shower, kinda sour 'cause my favorite group
ain't comin' with it, but i'm witchya 'cause you probably goin' through it
anyway, but anyhow, when in doubt
went on out and bought it 'cause i thought it would be jammin'
but examine all the flawsky wawsky, awfully
sad and it's costly, but that's all she
wrote and i hope i never have to float in that boat
up shit's creek, "it's weak" is the last quote
that i wanna hear when i'm goin' down
when all's said and done and we got a new joe in town
when the record player get to skippin' and slowin' down

up against the number one contender, as i enter
cause i gets heated like friction
motherfuck your whole jurisdiction, react this fact not fiction
telepathic addiction, to this homicidal recital
dangerous and vital to all my rivals
suicidal, brainwaves conveys
through the average motherfucker's minds these days
i'm all ready to put work in
take ten steps and turn to shoot the first nigga smirking
give a fuck, what's your name, what you claim
or why you came, motherfucker
don't explain
simply, don't tempt me, cause i'm simply
leavin hoes lives empty, the invincible mc

new york new york big city of dreams
and everything in new york ain't always what it seems
you might get fooled if you come from out of town
but i'm down by law, and i'm from the dogg pound
too much, i serve too many people, too much
it's too much, i serve too many people
and when i finish servin ain't gon be no sequel

gimme a couple g's, for every mc, i knocked to his knees
verbally useless, oh you got the juice? i squeeze you juiceless
the barbaric, versatile, you're no kin to me
so how the fuck you inherit my style?
now, out the clear blue sky, i can't deny
not a day goes by, don't get high, don't ask why
tonight's the night for me to rip microphones
into bits and pieces lyrical telekinesis
gets me into verbally vindictive
violent vocabulary bobs to existence
catch me in the pitch black path
i sit and let the sick thought pass through my mental
till i hear an instrumental
and detrimental verbals get to spittin
the highest in intellect, try connectin with the written
now they faced with the forbidden, vocally chosen
to explore new terrain, then remain unseen, throughout the war
dips like a low low, with my verbal fo' fo'
the cocoa complexion mc with the slow flow
fo sho', i takes it to you from the do'
motherfucker, mentally i go hardco'  you know  
i disconnect ya, kurupter, mc to vocally
void your whole molecular, structure

in ways that make mc's stop in daylight

invincibility is what makes

nah you can't even fade me
i fuck, you, your momma, your auntie, and your lady...

   

what? y'all thought y'all wasn't gonna see me?
i'm the osiris of this shit
wu tang is here forever, motherfuckers
this like, this '97
aight my niggas and my niggarettes
let's do it like this
i'ma rub your ass in the moonshine
let's take it back to '79

i bomb atomically, socrates' philosophies and hypotheses
can't define how i be dropping these mockeries
lyrically perform armed robbery
flee with the lottery, possibly they spotted me
battle scarred shogun, explosion when my pen hits tremendous
ultraviolet shine blind forensics
i inspect you through the future see millennium
killa beez sold fifty gold, sixty platinum
shackling the masses with drastic rap tactics
graphic displays melt the steel like blacksmiths
black wu jackets, queen beez ease the guns in
rumble with patrolmen, tear gas laced the function
heads by the score take flight incite a war
chicks hit the floor, die hard fans demand more
behold the bold soldier, control the globe slowly
proceeds to blow, swinging swords like shinobi
stomp grounds and pound footprints in solid rock
wu got it locked, performing live on your hottest block

as the world turns, i spread like germ
bless the globe with the pestilence, the hard headed never learn
this my testament to those burned
play my position in the game of life standing firm
on foreign land jump the gun out the frying pan
into the fire, transform into the ghost rider
a six pack and a streetcar named desire
who got my back
in the line of fire holding back?
what? my peoples if you with me, where the fuck you at?
niggas is strapped and they're tryna twist my beer cap
it's court adjourned for the bad seed from bad sperm
herb got my wig fried like a bad perm
what the blood clot? we smoke pot
and blow spots, you want to think twice? i think not
the iron lung ain't got to tell you where it's coming from
guns of navarone tearing up your battle zone
rip through your slums

i twist darts from the heart, tried and true
loop my voice on the lp
martini on the slang rocks, certified chatterbox
vocabulary 'donna talking, tell your story walking
take cover kid, what? run for your brother, kid
run for your team and your "six can't rhyme" groupies
so i can squeeze with the advantage and get wasted
my deadly notes reign supreme, your thought is basic compared to mine
domino effect, arts and crafts, paragraphs contain cyanide
take a free ride on my thought
i got the fashion catalogs for all y'all to all praise due to god

the saga continues
wu tang, wu tang

olympic torch flaming, we burn so sweet
the thrill of victory, the agony of defeat
we crush slow, flaming deluxe slow for
judgment day cometh, conquer, it's war
allow us to escape hell, globe spinning bomb
pocket full of shells out the sky golden arms
tunes spit the shitty mortal kombat sound
the fake false step make the blood stain the ground
a jungle junkie, vigilante tantrum
a death kiss catwalk, squeeze another anthem
hold it for ransom, tranquilized with anaesthesias
my orchestra, graceful, music ballerinas
my music sicily, rich california smell
an axe kill adventure, paint a picture well
i sing a song from sing sing, sipping on ginseng
righteous wax chaperon, rotating ring kings

march of the wooden soldiers, c cypher punks couldn't hold us
a thousand men rushing in, not one nigga was sober
perpendicular to the square we stay in gold like flair
escape from your dragon's lair
in particular my beats travel like a vortex
through your spine to the top of your cerebral cortex
make you feel like you bust a nut from raw sex
enter through your right ventricle clog up your bloodstream
heart terminal like grand central station
program fat basslines on novation
getting drunk like i'm fucking ducking five year probation

war of the masses, the outcome disastrous
many of the victim families save their ashes
a million names on walls, engraved in plaques
those who went back received penalties for the acts
another heart is torn as close ones mourn
those who stray, niggas get slayed on the song

the track renders helpless and suffers from multiple stab wounds
and leaks sounds that's heard
93 million miles away from
came one to represent the nation
this is a gathering of the masses
that come to pay respects to the wu tang clan
as we engage in battle, the crowd now screams in rage
the high chief jamel irief takes the stage
light is provided through sparks of energy
from the mind that travels in rhyme form
giving sight to the blind
the dumb are mostly intrigued by the drum
death only one can save self from
this relentless attack of the track spares none

yo yo yo, fuck that, look at all these crab niggas laid back
lamping like them gray and black puma's on my man's rack
codeine was forced in your drink
you had a navy green salamander fiend, bitches overheard you scream
you two faces, scum of the slum, i got your whole body numb
blowing like shalamar in '81
sound convincing, thousand dollar cork pop convention
hands like sonny liston, get fly permission
hold the fuck up, i'll unfasten your wig, bad luck
i humiliate, separate the english from the dutch
it's me, black noble drew ali, came in threes
we like the genovese, sazon season these degrees
it's earth, 93 million miles from the first
rough turbulence, the wave burst, split the megahertz

aiyo that's amazing, gun in your mouth talk, verbal foul hawk
connect thoughts to make my man child walk
swift notarizer, blue tang, all up in the high riser
new york yank visor, word tranquilizer
adjust the dosage, delegate my clan with explosives
while my pen blow lines ferocious
mediterranean, see y'all, the number one draft pick
tear down the beat god then delegate the god to see god
the swift chancellor, lex, the white gold tarantula
track truck diesel, play the weed god substantiala
max mostly, undivided then slide in sickening
guaranteed made 'em jump like rod strickland

so many females, so much inspiration

i get inspired by the blunts too

i roam the strip for bones to pick
when i find one, i'm done
take her home and quickly do this
i need not explain this  nah

another person's business, i cause dizziness
until you stop acting like a silly bitch

yo, crews are jealous 'cause we get props
the cops, wanna stop our fun, but the top
is where we're dwellin', swell and fat, no sleep
i work fit, and jerks get their hoes sweeped
under their noses, this bro's quick
they hit blunts and flip once
i'm chillin',  cause my crew's close, kid

i'm posted, most kids accept this as cool
i exit,  cause i'm an exception to the rule
i'm steppin' to the cool spots where crews flock
to snare a dip, or see where the shit that's flam b
blam leakin' out his pocket
so i got tons of indo and go to the owen's basement
my ace been fattenin' up tracks
time to get prolific with the whiz kid

greenbacks in stacks, don't even ask
who got the fat sacks? we can max pumpin' fat tracks
exchangin' facts about impacts,  cause in facts
my freestyle talent overpowers, brothers can't hack it

rappin', so i take time off to never rhyme soft
i'm off on my own shit
with my own clique, roll many backroads
with a fat stog' and blunt, foldin' runts
holdin' stunts captive with my persona
plus a bomber, zestin'
niggas is testin' my patience, but i stay fresh, and 

restin' at the mall, attendance on 'noid
but i am shoppin' for my wish to exploit
some ill fits, some new kicks
i often do this,  cause it's the pits not being dipped

flip the flyer attire females desire
baby, you can step to this if you admire
the extraordinary, dapper rapper
keep tabs on your main squeeze before i tap her

i'll mack her, attack her with the smoothness
i do this, peepin' what my crew gets  huh 
loot, props, respect, and blunts to pass
crews talk shit, but in my face they kiss my ass  smack  
they bite flows, but we make up new ones
if you're really dope, why ain't you signed yet?
but i get my loot from jive zomba
i'ma bomb ya; you will see, from now 'til infinity

yeah, this is how we chill from 93 'til

one for the money, yes, sir, two for the show
a couple of years ago on headland and delowe
was the start of something good
where me and my nigga rode the marta through the hood
just tryna find that hook up
now everyday we looked up at the ceiling
watching ceiling fans go 'round, tryna catch that feeling
off instrumentals, had my pencil and plus my paper
we caught the 86 lithonia headed to decatur
writing rhymes, tryna find our spot off in that light
light off in that spot, knowing that we could rock
doing the hole in the wall clubs, this shit here must stop
like "freeze " we making the crowd move
but we not making no g's and that's a no no

check it, a one two, a one two dope niggas in the cadillac
they call us, went from player's ball to ballers
putting the south up on the map was like little rock to banging
niggas say mothafuck that playin, they payin, we stayin, layin vocals
locales done made it with them big boys up in this industry
"outkast, yeah, them niggas, they making big noise"
over a million sold to this day, niggas they take it lightly
'96 gon' be that year that all y'all playa haters can bite me
i'm out this bitch

me and you
your momma and your cousin too
rolling down the strip on vogues
coming up, slamming cadillac doors
me and you
your momma and your cousin too
rolling down the strip on vogues
coming up, slamming cadillac doors

back in the day, when i was younger, hunger
looking to fill me belly with that rally's bullshit
pull shit off, like it was supposed to be pulled
full as a tick, i was stoned like them white boys
smoking them white golds before them blunts got crunk
chunky asses, passes getting thrown like hail mary's
and they looking like halle berry's
so so fine, intertwined, but we ain't sipping wine
we's just chilling, i'm the rabid villain, and i'm so high
smoking freely, me, lil b, reek, mone and shug
and my little brother james, thangs changed in the hood
where i live at, them rats know, "momma i want to sing
but momma i want to trick, and momma i'm sucking dick now"
we moving on up in the world like elevators
me and the crew, we pimps like '82
me and you like tony toni tone
like this, east point and we gone

me and you
your momma and your cousin too
rolling down the strip on vogues
coming up, slamming cadillac doors
me and you
your momma and your cousin too
rolling down the strip on vogues
coming up, slamming cadillac doors

got stopped at the mall the other day
heard a call from the other way that i just came from
some nigga was saying something, talking 'bout smoke something "hey man, you remember me from school?" "no not really"
but he kept smiling like a clown, facial expression looking silly
and he kept asking me, "what kinda car you drive?
i know you paid, i know y'all got beaucoup of hoes
from all them songs that y'all done made"
and i replied that i had been going through the same things that he had
true, i've got more fans than the average man
but not enough loot to last me to the end of the week
i live by the beat like you live check to check
if it don't move your feet then i don't eat so we like neck to neck
yes, we done come a long way like them slim ass cigarettes
from virginia, this ain't gon' stop, so we just gon' continue

hey, this is radio station wskee
we're taking calls on the wish line
making your wacky wishes come true
hello?

i wish i was a little bit taller, i wish i was a baller
i wish i had a girl who looked good, i would call her
i wish i had a rabbit in a hat with a bat
and a six four impala

i wish i was like six foot nine so i can get with leoshi
'cause she don't know me but, yo, she's really fine
you know i see her all the time, everywhere i go
and even in my dreams, i can scheme of ways to make her mine
'cause i know she's livin' phat
her boyfriend's tall and he plays ball, so how am i gonna compete with that?
'cause when it comes to playing basketball
i'm always last to be picked and in some cases never picked at all
so i just lean up on the wall
or sit up in the bleachers with the rest of the girls who came to watch their man ball
dag y'all  i never understood, black
why the jocks get the fly girls, and me, i get the hood rats
i tell 'em, "scat, skittle, scabobble"
got hit with a bottle and put in a hospital for talkin' that mess
i confess, it's a shame
when you livin' in a city that's the size of a box and nobody knows yo' name
glad i came, to my senses
like quick quick, got sick sick to my stomach, overcometh by thoughts
of me and her together, right?
so when i asked her out, she said i wasn't her type

i wish i was a little bit taller, i wish i was a baller
i wish i had a girl who looked good, i would call her
i wish i had a rabbit in a hat with a bat
and a six four impala
i wish i was a little bit taller, i wish i was a baller
i wish i had a girl who looked good, i would call her
i wish i had a rabbit in a hat with a bat
and a six four impala

i wish i had a brand new car so far, i got this hatchback
and everywhere i go, yo, i gets laughed at
and when i'm in my car i'm laid back
i got an 8 track, and a spare tire in the backseat, but that's flat
and do you really wanna know what's really wack?
see, i can't even get a date, so what do you think of that?
i heard that prom night is a bomb night
with a hood rat t'you can hold tight
but really though, i'm figaro
when in my car, i can't even get a hello
well, so many people wanna cruise crenshaw on sunday
one day i'mma have to get in my car and go
you know i take the 110 until the 105
get off at crenshaw, tell my homies, "look alive"
'cause it's hard to survive
when you're living in a concrete jungle and these girls keep passing me by
she looks fly, she looks fly
make me say, "my, my, my"

i wish i was a little bit taller, i wish i was a baller
i wish i had a girl who looked good, i would call her
i wish i had a rabbit in a hat with a bat
and a six four impala
i wish i was a little bit taller, i wish i was a baller
i wish i had a girl who looked good, i would call her
i wish i had a rabbit in a hat with a bat
and a six four impala

i wish i was a little bit taller
i wish i was a baller
i wish i was a little bit taller
i wish i was a baller
i wish i was a little bit taller, y'all
i wish i was a baller
i wish i was a little bit taller
i wish i was a baller

hey, i wish i had my way
'cause every day would be a friday, and you could even speed on the highway
i would play ghetto games
name my kids ghetto names: little mookie, big al, lorraine
yo, you know that's on the real
so if you're down on your luck then you should know just how i feel
'cause if you don't want me around
see, i go simple, i go easy, i go greyhound
hey, you, what's that sound?
everybody look what's going down
ah, yes, ain't that fresh?
everybody wants to get down like that

i wish i was a little bit taller, i wish i was a baller
i wish i had a girl who looked good, i would call her
i wish i had a rabbit in a hat with a bat
and a six four impala
i wish i was a little bit taller, i wish i was a baller
i wish i had a girl who looked good, i would call her
i wish i had a rabbit in a hat with a bat
and a six four impala

i wish, i wish

catch 'em and break
undress 'em, tie 'em with tape, no escape
the corleone, fettuccine capone
roam in your own zone
or get kidnapped and clapped in your dome
we got it sewn, the firm art of war is unknown
lower your tone, face it, homicide cases get thrown
aristocrats, politickin' daily with diplomats
see me, i'm an official mack, lex coupe triple black

criminal thoughts in the blue porsche
my destiny's to be the new boss
that nigga paulie gotta die, he too soft

i put the hit out
yo, the smoothest killer since bugsy, bitches love me
in queens where my drugs be, i wear guess jeans and rugbies
yo, my people from medina, they will see ya when you re up
bring your heater, all your cream go between us
real shit, my desert eagle got an ill grip
i chill with niggas that hit dominican spots and steal bricks
my red beam made a dread scream and sprayed a fed team
corleone be turnin' niggas to fiends
yukons and ninja black lexus

ki's is one and two fifth, so how we flip?
32 grams raw, chop it in half, get 16
double it times three, we got 48
which mean a whole lot of cream
divide the profit by four
subtract it by eight, we back to 16
now add the other two that 'mega bringin' through
so let's see, if we flip this other ki
then that's more for me, mad coke and mad leak
plus a five hundred cut in half is two fifty
now triple that times three
we got three quarters of another ki

the firm, baby, vol. 1

the harsh realities of life have taken toll
even jesus christ forsake my soul
please tell me what price to pay to make it whole
take control, i'm makin' dough but not enough to blow
jo's, they lust my flows, but ayo, i don't trust a soul
that's all i know or need to, these evil streets'll meet you
halfway and eat you alive tryin' to survive illegal
i'll leave you lost, mount you on a cross
whip you like a horse, sacrifice your life to a higher force
then i'll stomp your corpse
it's the bronx of course, recognize the accent
one of the last livin' still in action general assassins
catchin' any wreck, blastin' any tec, smashin' any chest
passin' any test; charles manson in the flesh
any last requests before you meet your maker?
sow what you reap or wake up
shakin' up a storm, like anita baker
i'll take you straight to hell and fill your heart with hate
incarcerate your fate in satan's fiery lake, then i lock the gate
make no mistake, this shit as real as joe
we follow the killer's code
when we come for you, tell me: where will you go?
nowhere to run, hide, i'll find you and silence your screams
and even if you kill me, i'll still be in your fuckin' dreams

you ain't a killer, you still learnin' how to walk
from new york to cali all the real niggas carry chalk
mark you for death
won't even talk that east or west crap
from watts to lefrak
it ain't where you're from, it's where's your gat

you've made a grave mistake
shouldn't have come here, you changed your fate
your brains'll make their debut on the table
when i raise the stakes
the pain is great, but only for a second
it starts strong, then lessens
just when you restin', the armaggedon sets in
left him with so much stress  t.s. 
blessed him with no regrets, yes
welcome to hell, son, the threshold of death
face the serpent, i blaze your person
you get laced for certain, leavin' jakes no trace to work from
close the case like curtains
i'm hurtin' heads severely, really tryin' to bring the pain
there's nothin' more satisfyin'
than when you cryin', screamin' my name
it's not a game, it's purple rain, floods of bloodstains
big pun's my thug's name
bustin' my guns, that's my love thang
i'll slit your jug' vein and snatch your adam's apple
john madden tackle your corpse
to hoist it on a cross at the tabernacle
that'll have to hurt, i'll work your body 'til it burst
then curse tu vida like a brujer a verse
i'm worse than anything you ever been through
sick in the head and mental
essentially meant to be the sole threat against you
when you awaken, your manhood'll be taken
fakin' like you satan, when i'm the rhymin' abomination

you ain't a killer, you still learnin' how to walk
from new york to cali all the real niggas carry chalk
mark you for death
won't even talk that east or west crap
from watts to lefrak
it ain't where you're from, it's where's your gat
you ain't a killer, you still learnin' how to walk
from new york to cali all the real niggas carry chalk
mark you for death
won't even talk that east or west crap
from watts to lefrak
it ain't where you're from, it's where's your gat

it's hard to analyze which guys are spies; be advised, people
we recognize who lies, it's all in the eyes, chico
we read 'em and see 'em for what they are
d's in undercover cars
takin' my picture like i'm a fuckin' star
i'm up to par, my game is in a smash
with half a million in the stash
passport with the gats, first name and last
ask anybody if my men are rowdy
give me the mini shottie
i'll body a nigga for a penny probably
i'm obligated to anything if it's crime related
if it shine, i'll take it; still in my prime and i finally made it
i hate the fact that i'm the last edition
properly a stats magician
could've went to college and been a mathematician
bad decisions kept me out the game
now i'm strictly out for cream
doin' things to fiends i doubt you'll ever dream
my team's the meanest thing you ever seen
measured by the heaven's kings
down to the devil's mezzanine
i've never screamed so loud, i'm proud to be alive
most heads die by 25 or catch a quick three to five
so be advised: the street's full of surprises
it's not what crew's the livest
one that survive, it's who's the wisest

you ain't a killer, you still learnin' how to walk
from new york to cali all the real niggas carry chalk
mark you for death
won't even talk that east or west crap
from watts to lefrak
it ain't where you're from, it's where's your gat
you ain't a killer, you still learnin' how to walk
from new york to cali all the real niggas carry chalk
mark you for death
won't even talk that east or west crap
from watts to lefrak
it ain't where you're from, it's where's your gat
you ain't a killer...

rap orgies with porgy and bess

so they had it at bein' a heroes
where did their bodies go, only god knows
you got caught, between the fire and the hoses
you wanna battle? bring your moses
forget what fun, what time moses and someone goin' down
and it ain't gastor douglass 'cause the roughest with the guy

we used to be partners 'fore the clip stole my rapper
i had to be right 'cause you fight like it was a bitch

and make sure it fit so now when i go and see with she
i thought the pirates through a telescope
and bomb 'em like it's make believe
blow me my sword, i out for my protection
'cause i might ship on landin' side and start an insurrection
a pirate had disguised himself as one of my crew
but i saw true and had to shake a him before he got through
hey, hey, guy the loot the booty
i formed like a ram, i gave an ultimatum
and told him he could do time
but he argued and fought me
he tried to bust right and so i took it upon myself
to make the brother walk the plank

to rhyme so dope, i made up my own vocabulaby, skilly
missed it from a bomber tacky lackin' all the bum
that get her to a to and fro, i guess they made me boy

 boo shoo coo coo  smoke

this rap goes for the brothers in the neighborhood
who used to rap on a polaroid   here comes father joe
let me clock the block as i pull fo' five
boof baf  i cut the block but got stopped
i used to play hookie just to see how good an mc was
he said i bust a battle   aight, i still took a gun
no cheeba, cheeba just a libra on a natural high
i waited so long to come out, i died and came back to life
so, hear the spirits, many fear us, a new style, son
this the new thing under the sun, when i come, i come
bam bam, alakazam, he grabbed the pocket book, they ran
i came back with the bag 'cause that's my momma, man
i'm just patrollin', boof baf on the block
but the spot that i clock, you get shot if your numbers' are bad
so, don't get caught in the fast lane, the fast lane
and just remain yourself and be the same
'cause many rappers these days say nuttin' for nuttin'
so, here's somethin' to take you from the am to the pm

'cause an imitator could never be greater
than the creator whose the originator, step up perpetrator
see you later, alligator, back stabbin' traitor
tape recorder, duplicator
roughly ridin' with the head tranzlator, huh 
and leave the 40 to be naughty in the 'frigerator 


say, gun man  boof baf  
say, tell me where you get your damn gun from?  boof baf  
you musta get it from the foreign land  boof baf  
we want to shoot up the whole of babylon  boof baf  
pay the man to rhyme onto it
say, gun man  boof baf  
say, tell me where you get your damn gun from?  boof baf  
you musta get it from the foreign land  boof baf  
you want to kill your own brother, man  boof baf  
ay, ay, ay  boof baf   
  undecipherable singing  


one two   i'm bout to set this off 
like this, hip hoppers, check it

another mc lose his life tonight, lord
i beg that you pray to jesus christ, why
oh lord, father don't let him bury me, whoa

i haunt mcs like mephistopheles, bringing swords of damocles
secret service keep a close watch as if my name was kennedy
abstract raps simple with a street format
gaze into the sky and measure planets by parallax
check out the retrograde motion, kill the notion
of biting and recycling and calling it your own creation
i feel like rockwell, somebody's watching me
i got no privacy whether on land or at sea
and for you biting zealots, your raps are cacophonic
hypocrite, critic, but deep inside you wish you had the pop hit
it hurts don't it, a refugee come to your turf
and take over the earth

see my rhymes, are the type of fly rhymes
that can only get down with my crew
and if you try, to take lines or bite rhymes
we'll show you how the refugees do

yeah, yeah behold, as my odes, manifold on your rhymes
two mcs can't occupy the same space at the same time
it's against the laws of physics
so weep as your sweet dreams break up like eurythmics
rap rejects, my tape deck, ejects projectile
whether jew or gentile, i rank top percentile
many styles, more powerful than gamma rays
my grammar pays, like carlos santana plays "black magic woman"
so while you fuming, i'm consuming mango juice under polaris
you just embarrassed 'cause it's your last tango in paris
and even after all my logic and my theory
i add a "motherfucker" so you ignant niggas hear me
crew remember take notes, as i sow my rap oats
and for you biting zealots, here's a quote

another mc lose his life tonight, lord
i beg that you pray to jesus christ, why
oh lord, father don't let him bury me, whoa

you can try but you can't divide the tribe
these cats can't rap, mister author i feel no vibe
the magazine says the girl should have went solo
the guys should stop rapping   vanish like menudo
took it to the heart, but every actor plays his part
as long as someone was listening, i knew it was a start
for me to get my chance, grab my pen and revamp
do a cameo while everybody do the dance
quick now, cause you running out of luck a
playing mr. big, i'm gonna get you sucka
while you munching at your luncheon
i'll be planning your assassination, then hit you like the dutchman

i compress sound sets with my rap dbx
then drop vocals on my 456 ampex
bring terror to the shop of horror
as she cry, "mi amor," the phantom dies in the opera
and to the younguns who carry gadgets
and kill six days a week, then rest on the sabbath
violence ain't necessary, unless you provoke me
then get buried like the great mussolini
and for you biting zealots, your rap styles are relics
no matter who you damage, you're still a false prophet


a little bit of loving
a little bit of something from you

oh
if it's time to make your spouse feel good
i make sure that you got all your plans done right
'cause i'm not sure
if she was right
that i don't really know what they can tell me
about our love so special
what do they know about our flavor?
tell me if it's real so i don't slap myself
'cause there's no point in hidin'
i feel ignited with your love
it's so obvious, i'm sorry that it's pure
yeah yeah

i think i need a little bit of lovin'
a little bit of somethin'
i think i need a little bit of lovin'
a little bit of somethin' from you
woah, i think i need a little bit of lovin'
a little bit of somethin', yeah
'cause this love is all i have of you

if you like me now, wait 'til you get used to me
this is not no sit down go   get off your feet
we could dance all night, girl come and rock with me
this ain't the same old love that you can get every week  no, no 
take a trip around the world with me  come on girl 
i will take a chance to get down with you  get down, get down 
my past is my past, leave that back  leave that behind 
i'll give myself to you, woah woah

i think i need a little bit of lovin'
a little bit of somethin'
i think i need a little bit of lovin'
a little bit of somethin' from you
woah, i think i need a little bit of lovin'
a little bit of somethin', yeah
'cause this love is all i have of you

it's all in her eyes
what we share, you and i  yeah 
it is no more, not the same
but it's all that we made

i think i need a little bit of lovin'
a little bit of somethin'
i think i need a little bit of lovin'
a little bit of somethin' from you
woah, i think i need a little bit of lovin'
a little bit of somethin', yeah  just a little bit, just a little bit 
'cause this love is all i have of you  yeah, yeah 


ah  check the crippled man, sittin' in the church
my conscience hurts, flesh like me hits the dirt
she's paralyzed from her feet to her thighs
and the man who pulled the trigger didn't even lose his left eye.
i check jimmy cuttin hair at the barbershop
he plays the bass guitar, like david plays the harp
his knowledge name is greek, cause whenever he speaks
he's got the wisdom of king solomon, bags in his eyes from no sleep
sometimes he thought of the fame in madison square garden
so some seek stardom, but they forget harlem
but "seek ye, first of all the kingdom of god," is what my pops told me
so if i fall, could the choir catch me?
i flew away, on a mountain, got tempted by satan
got bitten by a cobra, but the lord took my venom
so who's side am i on? i'm on the righteous
always check the lyrics, no time to contradict

some seek stardom, then they forget harlem
some seek stardom, then they forget harlem
some seek stardom, then they forget harlem
they keep their pockets full, but their souls run empty

well ay yo family i beseech you, in the hopes that i may reach you
my mother taught me one day that judgment day would come someday
born a dark black child, with kinky hair grown wise
and teachers disliked me, cause i knew where my culture be
so now yeah mom i read history, i can't neglect my passion, see
rockin's kind of new to me, cause my true love was poetry
white was good and bad was black but black was just a massa lackey
built for that b. nimble jack and i'd like to save you from the wicked
d dog clear i wouldn't be wet; the black to mourn, tomorrow's death
the evil things, glad that i, while angels wrote this violence why?
help me make me comprehend my black bezerk and why cast it
time to blaze the angels nappy heads are braided that you make me
see what's wrong with me that don't make you flee when i enter your
vicinity, you see my god ain't never asked of me
so yo i be wised up with greek to go and be
but at last i clearly see what's wrong with me: it be your
insecurity of me and my ability
so, prithee, won't you let me be or has thou asked too much from thy
to tell the truth and not to lie? oh my...

some seek stardom, then they forget harlem
some seek stardom, then they forget harlem
some seek stardom, then they forget harlem
brothers keep their pockets full, but their souls run empty
some seek stardom, then they forget harlem
some seek stardom, then they forget harlem
some seek stardom, then they forget harlem
sisters keep their pockets full, but their souls run empty

but as i grew, i knew cause the master told me
from a baby to a woman from a woman to a baby
life is so short, hardcore becomes hard corpse
stiff in a coffin where the money's no longer the source
there we go, there we go, there we go
i got mine now won't you get yours, we never open doors
so we neglect, and don't protect the ones that's left
people never really seem to care
and then they cry out, "my people  why aren't we treated equal?"
as we flee, we flee our own communities
we leave our family in poverty
and then we blame it on another, so family please recover
oh c'mon please you can come with me now and blow it now
if you want to, we're through...

some seek stardom, then they forget harlem
some seek stardom, then they forget harlem
some seek stardom, then they forget harlem
families keep their pockets full, but their souls run empty
some seek stardom, then they forget harlem
some seek stardom, then they forget harlem
some seek stardom, then they forget harlem
people keep their pockets full, but their souls run empty
some seek stardom, then they forget harlem
some seek stardom, then they forget harlem
some seek stardom, then they forget harlem
we keep their pockets full, but their souls run empty
some seek stardom, then they forget harlem
some seek stardom, then they forget harlem
some seek stardom, then they forget harlem
brothers keep their pockets full, but their souls run empty

can't be without you, baby
not even for a night
and so i've been thinking lately
of being with you for all time

mmm, it's four thirty in eastern time where i'm at, shorty
in the a.m., i'm sayin' though, where you at, shorty?
i'm happy without you but got my doubts, shorty
like, like if my currency dry out, would you be out thirsty?
would your mind want me, like your soul want me?
when i go down on you, i drown for quarter centuries
you a whole globe, you a whole earth
and i'm a troubled millionaire that fears you know your worth
absence makes the heart grow fonder so we ponder
on the things we gon' do when distance ain't a problem
our intentions, they was honest, we was cordial, we was talkin'
we was hidin', there was no one, we was lyin', it was fuckin'
foreplay with your body divided now
it's forehead kisses before my flight departed, that
showed me the feelings, about to play with that
three days away, three hours back, hold on

can't be without you, baby
ain't got no voice
where my phone? who got my phone? you got my phone?
she called me, hold on man
 you have reach the voicemail box 
hol' up

just got off the stage, know you sleepin', but wait
just lost my voice for this crowd i only seen your face in everywhere, but these women real as a fairy tale
can barely talk but you hit my line, i'ma hear you well
i need that vibe from you 'cause spendin' time on this bus
take the power from my brain, in between your thighs they should rest
we alive, we in love, we can die if we don't
if monogamy you want then share your time with pornhub  ha  
i'm just playin', just need you know i'm lonely
green tea, ricola and honey gold
we missin' each other more so we horny or don't speak
three hours apart, cool, two days and you seein' me
my vocals is now shot, call up doctor, steroid me
we cortisone 'til my quarter zone is back as your toy please
i know you don't need nothin' but what i got
two days away, three hours back, goodnight

 can't be without you, baby 
we one tomorrow away from celebratin' that that very tomorrow's the day  not even for a night 
i know it's late but i'ma hit you later
 and so i been thinking lately of being with you for all time 

i'm on the way, you know
once you know my voice back
'cause see like a hunnid forevers plus a day since i last seen the livin' embodiment of my forever
face to face and i might just inject your body with knowledge
your body with style, you'll be flyer than rox brown
okay, i'm lyin', nobody flyin' than rox
but i might just get in a half squat position and proposition you with a shiny rock under an open box
so the onlookers can understand that we all official
we all just kids lookin' for the first love we ever injected
so whenever i'm never next to you, i never look to the next woman even on her best moment to bestowed
a stove you kept warm for me, as i kept distance you kept cookin'
sugar, we went from three days and three hours 'til we two days and three hours to, "girl he think he darius lovehall, he walkin' down the street writin' poetry to make the between yo' knees feel like you need balance"
and i see you alot but i see you on camera so it seem like a lie when i say i need to see us together
from three days to two days, from two days to today
from today to tonight, from tonight to forever, i'm up the street

man a bad boy on the corner
so move from on here, cause we a dange rous
man a bad boy on the corner
so move from on here, cause we a dange rous
  barrington skats and shouts to the fade  


crawling through a systematic maze to demise
pain in our eyes
strain of drownin', wading through the lies
degradation so loud that you can't hear the sound of our cries  doo, doo 
all the dreamers have gone to the side of the road which we relay on
inundated by media, virtual mind fucks in streams

all we wanted was a chance to talk
'stead we only got outlined in chalk
feet have bled a million miles we've walked
revealing at the end of the day, the charade

perpetrators beware say a prayer if you dare for the believers
with a faith at the size of a seed enough to be redeemed  doo doo 
relegated to savages bound by the way of the deceivers
so anchors be sure that you're sure we ain't no amateurs

all we wanted was a chance to talk
'stead we only got outlined in chalk
feet have bled a million miles we've walked
revealing at the end of the day, the charade

with the veil off our eyes we'll truly see
and we'll march on
and it really won't take too long
and it really won't take us very long

revealing at the end of the day, the charade
all we wanted was a chance to talk
'stead we only got outlined in chalk
'stead we only got outlined in chalk
revealing at the end of the day, the charade
all we wanted was a chance to talk
revealing at the end of the day, the charade
all we wanted was a  the charade 


"let me now turn, to our program for the future."
 news snippets 
"the economy right now, is extremely supportive of the president and his policies."
"fbi scientists have found chemical traces, consistent with a bomb or a missile, on a piece of wreckage."
"police using clubs and tear gas against demonstrators."
"they called me a mother   bleeped out  ing so and so... and a white
fascist...like they said, 'you're getting some of your own medicine'..."

telling lies, to our vision
telling lies, to our children
telling lies, to our babies
only truth, can take us away
from here

you can't fool all the people all of the time
but if you fool the right ones, then the rest will fall behind
tell me who's got control of your mind? your world view?
is it the news or the movie you're taking your girl to?
know what i'm saying cause uncle sam got a plan
if you examine what they telling us then you will understand
what they planting in the seeds of the next generation
feeding our children miseducation
no one knows if there's ufos or any life on mars
or what they do when they up in the stars
because i don't believe a word of what the president said
he filling our head with lies got us hypnotized
when he be speaking in code words about crime and poverty
drugs, welfare, prisons, guns and robbery
it really means us, there's no excuse for the slander
but what's good for the goose, is still good for the gander
see...

i don't believe bob marley died from cancer
31 years ago i would've been a panther
they killed huey cause they knew he had the answer
the views that you see in the news is propaganda

verse 2:
i don't want no computer chip in my arm
i don't wanna die by a nuclear bomb
i say we all rush the pentagon
pull out guns and grab the intercom
my first words will be i believe
man made god, outta ignorance and fear
if god made man, then why the hell would he put us here?
i thought he's supposed to be the all loving
the same god who let hitler put the jews in the oven
we don't fall for the regular shit, they try to feed us
all this half ass leadership, flipping position
they turn politician and shut the hell up and follow tradition
for your tv screen, is telling lies to your vision
every channel got some brainwashed cop shit to watch
running up in niggas cribs claiming that they heard shots
it's a plot, but busta can you tell me who's greedier?
big corporations, the pigs or the media?
sign of the times, terrorism on the rise
commercial airplanes, falling out the sky like flies
make me wonder what secrets went down with ron brown
who burnt churches to the ground with no evidence found?
it's not coincidence, it's been too many steady incidents
it could've been the klan who put that bomb at the olympics
but it probably was the fbi, deep at the core
cause if they make us all panic then they can start martial law


the police is telling lies fooling millions
what are they teaching our kids in these school buildings?
televised, enterprise making a killing
controlling our lives, this ain't living
no this ain't living

fbi, cia
atf, kkk
irs, tnt
cbs, nbc


"uh, we view each other with a great love and a great understanding. and that we try to expand this to the general black population, and also, people   oppressed people all over the world. and, i think that we differ from some other groups simply because we understand the system better than most groups understand the system. and with this realization, we attempt to form a strong political base based in the community with the only strength that we have and that's the strength of a potentially destructive force if we don't get freedom."

so then we moved to shaolin land
a young youth, yo, rockin' the gold tooth, 'lo goose
only way i be gettin' the g off was drug loot
and let's start it like this, son
rollin' with this one and that one
pullin' out gats for fun
but it was just a dream for the teen who was a fiend
started smokin' woolies at 16
and runnin' up in gates and doin' hits for high stakes
makin' my way on fire escapes
no question i would speed for cracks and weed
the combination made my eyes bleed
no question i would flow off and try to get the dough all
stickin' up white boys in ball courts
my life got no better, same damn 'lo sweater
times is rough and tough like leather
figured out i went the wrong route
so i got with a sick ass clique and went all out

it's been twenty two long hard years, i'm still strugglin'
survival got me buggin', but i'm alive on arrival
i peep at the shape of the streets
and stay awake to the ways of the world 'cause shit is deep
a man with a dream with plans to make cream
which failed; i went to jail at the age of fifteen
a young buck sellin' drugs and such, who never had much
tryin' to get a clutch at what i could not
the court played me short, now i face incarceration
pacin', goin' upstate's my destination
handcuffed in the back of a bus, forty of us
life as a shorty shouldn't be so rough
but as the world turned i learned life is hell
livin' in the world no different from a cell
every day i escape from jakes givin' chase
sellin' base, smokin' bones in the staircase
though i don't know why i chose to smoke sess
i guess that's the time when i'm not depressed
but i'm still depressed, and i ask: what's it worth?
ready to give up so i seek the old earth
who explained workin' hard may help you maintain
to learn to overcome the heartaches and pain
we got stick up kids, corrupt cops, and crack rocks
and stray shots, all on the block that stays hot
leave it up to me while i be livin' proof
to kick the truth to the young black youth
but shorty's runnin' wild, smokin' sess, drinkin' beer
and ain't tryin' to hear what i'm kickin' in his ear
neglected for now, but yo, it gots to be accepted
that what? that life is hectic

cash rules everything around me
c.r.e.a.m., get the money
dollar dollar bill, y'all
cash rules everything around me
c.r.e.a.m., get the money

word up, you gotta get over, straight up and down

cash rules everything around me
c.r.e.a.m., get the money
dollar dollar bill, y'all
cash rules everything around me
c.r.e.a.m., get the money
dollar dollar bill, y'all

honey, check it out, you got me mesmerized
with your black hair and your fat ass thighs
street poetry is my everyday
but yo, i gotta stop when you trot my way
if i was working at the club you would not pay
ayo, my man phife diggy, he got something to say

i like 'em brown, yellow, puerto rican or haitian
name is phife dawg from the zulu nation
told you in the jam that we can get down
now let's knock the boots like the group h town
you got bbd all on your bedroom wall
but i'm above the rim and this is how i ball
a gritty little something on the new york street
this is how i represent over this here beat
talking 'bout you

yo, i took you out
but sex was on my mind for the whole damn route
my mind was in a frenzy and a horny state
but i couldn't drop dimes 'cause you couldn't relate

relax yourself girl, please set tle down  you couldn't relate 
relax yourself girl, please set tle down  you couldn't relate 
relax yourself girl, please set tle down
relax yourself girl, please set tle down

stretch out your legs, let me make you bawl
drive you insane, drive you up the wall
staring at your dome piece, very strong
stronger than pride, stronger than teflon
take you on the ave and you buy me links
now i wanna pound the poontang until it stinks
you can be my mama and i'll be your boy

original rude boy, never am i coy
you can be a shorty in my ill convoy
not to come across as a thug or a hood
but hon, you got the goods, like madelyne woods
by the way, my name's malik
the five foot freak
let's say we get together by the end of the week
she simply said, "no", labelled me a ho
i said, "how you figure?" "my friends told me so"
i hate when silly groupies wanna run they yap
word to god, hon, i don't get down like that

i'll have you weak in the knees that you could hardly speak
or we could do like uncle l and swing an ep in my jeep
keep it on the down, yo, we keep it discreet

bust off on your couch, now you got seaman's furniture

shaheed, phife and the extra p
stacy beadle, pj and my man l.g

young man facing the land, chasing his dreams
motivated by a picture of his daughters he embraced in his hand
thinking what it might take him to win
and a 9 to 5 ain't supplyin' what he tryin' to drive
locked up and got signed to jive
for the deal, got a quarter mil', shot back to the house on the hill
and blow some dough to show, it's real
flossed his wheels and lost his deal

i got a vision of international pimpin'
i'm into natural women when i'm out travelin' with my compadres
from oakland to auckland
we always walk and talk like we got game
i've traveled the canals of venice
and aroused crowds in s o paulo with a single sentence
i penetrate the language barriers with positive vibes
and bridge gaps with raps keeping my spirit alive, and i've
thrived, as i roam through zones
collecting my paper with these poems and songs
getting the girl, grabbing the money and runnin'
starting up companies and keeping the product coming
hieroglyphics' adventures all around the globe
mental enrichment, and we gotta get the dough
 oh oh

mantronix is the crew that you must hear
but please don't get concerned
'cause although our sounds are really hot
we're really not here to burn
we re just here to rock this house you see, with perpetuated ease
yes the rhymes devise and to prescribe some game for the ladies
because 
fresh is the word, that's how i'm described
and so sweet is the rap and what i prescribe
so for the people that's you see, the people ?
for all the blacks, puerto ricans, and the white people, too
see, my style is unreal, too tight to unseal
so explosive, so unnoticed, it's hard to conceal
as dominant as my color, could take out any other
high post as i said and you will discover, in time
just wait, and never too late, for see my rhyme is in his prime
like the name on your plate, but cold crushed as ice
much higher than a fire, so hot can't stop for the ladies my desire
for it's them i adore, to them a rapport
from any angle i untangle, there's more in store
cause on the mic i am controller
who's down to rock and rolla
put more groove into a body
and no it's not a holder
with a style that's mine, autographed design
perfectionally put and well inclined
to just rock on stop at the drop of a dime
and in case you wanna know, virgo's my sign
 scratching and cutting 
well automated as stated
milked and gold plated
a fresh new sound with rhymes related
yes devised, organized with precision is more
mantronix, soul sonic like a lion's roar
a roar that's been developed and created to fear
like a nickle plated colt with the nightlife clear
shining in your eyes, like feeling disgrace
cause the crew what they're doing is dissing you in the face
so you scream, almighty, please change the pace
because although you did those things you never felt the taste
of the sensational rapper, crime master tee
the solo rapper brother of the t o p
dominatin' the house, segregatin' the place
like a drink of over proof with 7 up is the taste
because it's smooth, mellow, black and not yellow
to most people i'm unknown cuz i just say hello
chillin's my thing, i throw parties and swing
and on the side will abide to a midnight fling
ya just c'mon party people let's dance and sing
cuz when you listen to this crew i said it's no no thing
 scratching and cutting 
yes fresh is the word, mantronix is here
and we're so intoxicatin' like a 40 of beer
never squared, so sincere, if you miss and clear
cuz this crew goddammit got too much flair
we can harass, pass, cut so fast
ya see delectable sound with much contrast
will import this sport, the sound's assault
because making big dollars is our resort
so just try, don't lie, it's time you buy
this funky fresh new cut from the main denied
g.k. that's him, the tee that's me
to listen to the scratch that make djs flee 
 scratching and cutting 
while dynamic, programmatic
fly and romantic
full proof and debonair and so fantastic
we're comin' straight at ya from a planet fresh
on an outskirt state, call it n y s
we're guaranteed to perform, for you to inform
we're like a panty raid night at an all girl dorm
taking control of every situation
so prepare yourself for the swift invasion
of the crew on the groove
so move and give us room
because a step in our direction just insinuate what you're doin'
fly as hell and oh so fresh
takes a job almighty because we know we're the best
with the capability to do other things
besides sportin' fly girls and diamond rings
with the high as the rise and automise
with the coldcrush beat and the dj high five
so a, act now you know a
put two and a flow a
about to do the rock your a stereo a
with the ease to please in any degrees
from the zero to the fifties, even nineties
cuz.. rockin' the house is a way of life
like the cuts to the butts without a knife
like jekyll and hide whose in their slide
we turn the party out when we're side by side

i know that it hurts sometimes, but it's beautiful
working every day, now you're bleeding through your cuticles
passing through a portal as you're sittin' in your cubicle
isn't life beautiful? i think that life is beautiful
tryin' to keep your cool at your grandfather's funeral
finding out eventually the feeling wasn't mutual
you were not invited 'cause you're nothing like the usual
isn't life beautiful? i think that life is beautiful
you wanna see your friends, but you're stuck inside a hospital
doctor walks in and he tells you that it's terminal
tumor in your brain and they're sayin' it's inoperable
isn't life beautiful? i think that life is beautiful
they'll kill your little brother and they'll tell you he's a criminal
they'll fucking kill you too, so you better not get physical
welcome to america, the type of shit is typical
isn't life beautiful? i think that life is beautiful

wake up in the morning, now you doing the impossible
find out what's important, now you're feeling philosophical
when i die, i'll pack my bags, move somewhere more affordable
isn't life horrible? i think that life is horrible
you think she's adorable, she thinks that you're intolerable
you think you can do it, but your chances are improbable
once you feel unstoppable, you run into an obstacle
isn't life comical? i think that life is comical

and if you ever need a friend then you got me
and in the end, when i die, would you watch me?
and if i try suicide, would you stop me?
would you help me get a grip or would you drop me?
run away, make friends with the moon
why you trippin'? you'll be with your friends soon
there comes a time when everybody meets the same fate
i think i'ma die alone inside my room

isn't life beautiful? i think that life is beautiful
isn't life beautiful? i think that life is beautiful
isn't life beautiful? i think that life is beautiful
isn't life beautiful? i think that life is beautiful


you think oakland california is a city of punks
it only takes a second, to pop the trunk
and just like that you know it's real
you're in the right damn town to get killed
it's all about the game, and nothin else
you come out here, you better watch yourself
cause you can wear what you want, even blue or red
but cross the wrong brothers, and end up dead
you catch a body full of bullets, and get blasted
tryin to be a gangsta but you just ain't lastin
this little town is gettin wild as hell
check the penetentiaries and all the jails
if they could lock us all up that would be just fine
got my partners from oakland doin serious time
you can't argue with the truth it's hard to be black
but it's a mindgame, and you gotta deal with that
i wake up everyday and i just can't wait
to make mo money, cause back in the days
when i rapped, i did the same damn thing i do now
grab the microphone, and show you how
but i was broke, the only thing i had was game
i started makin money and knew things would change
bought a benz, thought it might earn respect
but the opd, found it hard to accept
i got jacked by the task and jacked by the vice
face down on the ground keep my hands in sight
put the handcuffs on backseat i'm in it
illegal search for about thirty minutes
askin me, where's the dope
where's my gun, but i don't know
i said i'm rappin, they laugh like i told a joke
and to this day they think i'm sellin coke

i want to be free   and that's the truth  ohhh yeahhh
i want to be free  ohhh yeahhh

i be in oakland california every day of my life
bass so hard you think i'm smokin a pipe
and if i don't smoke it, i gots to grind
searched all my stuff, and all you find
is a pocket full of money count seven g's
now you wanna think i'm sellin keys
cause i'm a black man, but i run my own business
so why the police wanna send me to prison
they see a brother makin major cash
they knock a patch out his black ass
and that's the truth, you can't argue you at all
tryin to give you ten years for a phone call
ain't even trippin on the dank smoke
cause all they wanna find, is guns and coke
in court all the time tryin to fight it
we get rich, we get indeibted
so what's the problem officer this time?
is havin' big money being black a crime?
or did you take me to jail, to teach me a lesson
charge me with somethin, or just ask questions
about the brothers i hang around
what's really goin on in the oakland town
tell me who went broke, and who got rich
but too $hort baby just ain't no snitch
you say you're just doin your job
but you're gettin on my nerves, just like bob
everytime i hit a corner, i see you
always tellin brothers what to do
you lock me up cause i don't know how to act
but i'm down for mine so i be talkin back
and when i do, you treat me bad as hell
i'm sick of spendin nights in jail


got out of jail about fo' fifteen
walkin down the street like a broke dopefiend
had a pocket full of money tryin to play the role
benz got towed and i was hella cold
but i ain't trippin, i'm gettin used to it now
handcuffed your boy took me straight downtown
for three warrants, had to catch me sooner or later
cause the five oh's always tryin to jack a playa
for no reason, wasn't doin nothin wrong
you think i'm lyin, singin that same ol song
well i'm a black man, ridin in a benz
how in the hell did i make these ends? here we go
i pull over to the right
stop the engine keep my hands in sight
i start cursin, cause it don't make sense
why would i run and try to jump a fence
if i was plannin, a smooth getaway
i never woulda stopped in the first place
you'd be high speed chasin me but this time you ain't
cause all i got on me is a big fat bank
and i hope i don't get robbed by you know who
make me donate some g's to the boys in blue
and if i sue, i won't get nothin back
but i ain't mad... i'm just black...

i couldn't trust my own homies, just a bunch of dirty rats
will i succeed? paranoid from the weed
and hocus pocus, i try to focus, but i can't see
and in my mind i'm a blind man doin' time
look to my future,  cause my past is all behind me
is it a crime to fight for what is mine?
everybody's dyin', tell me what's the use of tryin'
i've been trapped since birth, cautious  cause i'm cursed
and fantasies of my family in a hearse
and they say it's the white man i should fear
but it's my own kind doin' all the killin' here
i can't lie, ain't no love for the other side
jealousy inside, make 'em wish i died
oh my lord, tell me what i'm livin' for
everybody's droppin', got me knockin' on heaven's door
and all my memories of seein' brothers bleed
and everybody grieves, but still nobody sees
recollect your thoughts, don't get caught up in the mix
 cause the media is full of dirty tricks

somebody help me, tell me where to go from here
 cause even thugs cry, but do the lord care?
try to remember but it hurts
i'm walkin' through the cemetery, talkin' to the dirt
i'd rather die like a man than live like a coward
there's a ghetto up in heaven and it's ours
"black power " is what we scream
as we dream in a paranoid state
and our fate is a lifetime of hate
dear mama, can you save me? and fuck peace
 cause the streets got our babies, we gotta eat
no more hesitation, each and every black male's trapped
and they wonder why we suicidal running 'round strapped

so judge us when we get to where we're goin wearin' a cross
that's real, got him, lurked him, crept the fuck up on him
sold a half a million tapes, now everybody want him
after talkin' behind my back like a bitch would
tellin' them niggas, "you can fade him"
punk, i wish you would

the original lick splickety, higher than yosemite
breaking the mold mentally, master with no limiting
making 'em say "ugh ", they worshipping our force viciously
watching the floor tip in your temple of authenticity
often they say i m off it, i offer my crossed empathy
they forgot what we on, i ll remind 'em with hostility
hot diggity damn, everyone running scams
gotta cover your clams and take another glance
running a clinic, no scans, ain't no one claimin' yo mans
it's all pertaining to plan, call me the architect

moses with the pen, each line an ocean i can part it at
but that's too deep

i used to write raps on the back of the bus
now i'm in the front seat shifting the gears

it's funny how things can change
three hundred dollars to my name, led to hollywood
i was living off ramen and change
five hundred dollars on these dinners, never have to pay
growing up my teachers told me
"you better get them grades up if you wanna finish high school
and after high school, you better get a degree
'cause it's a dog eat dog world, you could live in the street"
flashback, i had my walkman in the minivan
listening to nsync, saw my name on the cd
bleach blond tips, wanted to be jt
wanted to do big things, had to fulfill a dream
one might say i was doomed from the get go
but those same people assume, 'cause they'll never know
what it's like to be called to what's not set in stone
i am one with the ebb and flow, that's all i know

kiss the earth that birthed you
gave you tools just to stay alive
and make it out when the sun is ruined

that's the same way you showed me, showed me
you showed me love

ejectin' styles from my lethal weapon
my pen that rocks from here to oregon
there's more again, catch it like a psycho flashback
i love gats; if rap was a gun, you wouldn't bust back
i come with shit in all types of shapes and sounds
and where i lounge is my stompin' grounds
i give an order to my peeps across the water
to go and snatch up props all around the border
and get far like a shootin' star
'cause who i are is livin' the life of pablo escobar
point blank as i kick the square biz
there it is, you're fuckin' with pros, and there it goes

yo, chill with the feedback, black, we don't need that
it's 10 o'clock, ho, where the fuck's your seed at?
feelin' mad hostile, wearin' a ropostale
flowin' like christ when i speaks the gospel
stroll with the holy robe, then attack the globe
with the buck us style, the ruckus
ten times ten men committin' mad sin
turn the other cheek and i'll break your fuckin' chin
slayin' boom bangs like african drums
 he'll be  comin' around the mountain when i come
crazy flamboyant for the rap enjoyment

now they money's gettin' stuck to the gum under the table
that's what you get when you misuse what i invent
your empire falls and you lose every cent
for tryna blow up a scrub
now that thought was just as bright as a 20 watt light bulb
should've pumped it when i rocked it
niggas so stingy they got short arms and deep pockets
this goes on in some companies
with majors, they're scared to death to pump these
first of all, who's your a r?
a mountain climber who plays an electric guitar?
but he don't know the meanin' of dope
when he's lookin' for a suit and tie rap
that's cleaner than a bar of soap
and i'm the dirtiest thing in sight

you best protect ya neck

"oh hell, there he go again talking that shit"
bend, corners like i was a curve, i struck a nerve
and now you 'bout to see this southern playa serve
i heard it's not where you're from but where you pay rent
then i heard it's not what you make but how much you spent
you got me bent like elbows, amongst other things, but i'm not worried
cause when we step up in the party; like a mouse, you scurry
so go get your fucking shine box and your sack of nickels
it tickles to see you try to be like mr. pickles
daddy fat sax, b i g b o i
it's that same motherfucka that took them knuckles to your eye
and i try, to warn you not to test but you don't listen
giving the shout out to my uncle darnell locked up in prison

now throw your hands in the air
and wave 'em like you just don't care
and if you like fish and grits and all that pimp shit
everybody let me hear you say, "o yea yer"
now throw your hands in the air
and wave 'em like you just don't care

to the female gender, ain't nothing better
let me know when it's wet enough to enter

i'm not a supermodel from a magazine, mmm mmm
i'm okay with not being perfect
'cause that's perfect to me

no matter where i go, everybody stares at me
not into fancy clothes, i'm rocking baggy jeans
getting too close for comfort, but comfort is what i need
so i eat my body weight in chocolate and ice cream
maybe i bite my nails and don't think before i speak
don't fit in any crowd, don't ever get much sleep
i wish my legs were bigger, bigger than new york city
and i'll love who i want to love, 'cause this love is gender free

you know i get depressed, are you impressed with my honesty?
still i wear what i wanna 'cause i'm cool with what's underneath  mmm 

don't feel like putting makeup on my cheeks
do what i wanna
love every single part of my body
top to the bottom
i'm not a supermodel from a magazine  nah

if you don't wanna wear makeup, don't wear makeup
if you don't wanna break up, then kiss and make up
remember if you wanna, you can go home
you can say that enough is enough, ah

or will it know to beat the odds regardless of the skin tone?

the half on the artifacts in jersey
'cause brothers be buggin', not givin' love to the nuccas
sayin' fuck us, 'cause we be shinin' brighter than the suckers
shootin' me prison nobody listens to your dissin'
'cause, yo, my shit's legit and as a lyricist i'm hittin'
the high notes, so why don't, i smile when i take pictures?
'cause now that i rock i got more niggas on my jock than bitches
i just wanna do my jams with fams and slam into some hypeness
but biters and backstabbin' rappers don't even like us
but props due, peep the source, rap pages and the billboard
and read about the tours while you be flappin' your jaws
i freak techniques, 'cause talk is cheaper than beepers from broad street
punks pop junk, tame and da sensai leave 'em all beat
so peep how deep my technique freaks and how my shit sounds
c'mon wit da c'mon, git down wit da git down

c'mon wit da c'mon, git down wit da git down

to prove a point, that the niggas is the joint
magazines where we're seen, now pop the tape in your deck
i got the heavy ammunition cuz i'm flexi wit da tech
niggas, can't believe the artifacts achieve
got, tricks up my sleeve so bow down on your knees
yo, we ain't got the same lame, ordinary plain game
put to shame any crew who wants to feel the flame
so bring submission to the rap recognition
my right hand is itching from the shit that i'm scripting
so pass the baton, to the next runner up, tame
i give a pound so, c'mon wit da git down

aiyyo, word to my grandma's tampons, i drop bombs, but since
our demo tracks had gaps some said my fat raps was half assed
watchin' others rock and clock we shocked 'em like a robot
with our props, so now the notty head niggas got more knots yo
my pockets are lumpy, chump, my drunk style is trunky
dunk my disc in crisp, put funk in funk like humpty hump
cuz i'm comin' from the underground i'm down wit da git down
mc's who used to diss us, get pissed 'cause they ain't shit now
the artifacts, represent on every stage we step on
the days of gettin' slept on, are dead because we keep on
peepin' these weak mc's, who cheese with their bologny
'cause they're phony as fuck, and couldn't pull shit off of tow trucks
so yo bro, now you know my flow so go and sit down
or c'mon wit da c'mon, git down wit da git down

hustler, word, i pull the trigger long
grit my teeth, spray till every nigga's gone
got my block sewn, armored dope spots
last thing i sweat's a sucka punk cop
move like a king when i roll, hops
you try to flex, bang, another nigga drops
you gotta deal with this cause there's no way out
why? cash money ain't never gonna play out
i got nothin to lose, much to gain
in my brain, i got a capitalist migraine
i gotta get paid tonight, you muthafuckin right
 my grip, check my bitch, keep my game tight
so many hoes on my jock, think i'm a movie star
nineteen, i got a fifty thousand dollar car
go to school, i ain't goin for it
kiss my ass, bust the cap on the moet
cause i don't wanna hear that crap
 chorus 
hustler
hustler
hustler
h u s t l e r hustler
 kid drop in 
yo man you know what i'm sayin?
you got it goin on my man, i like how it's goin down
you got the fly cars, the girls, the jewels
look at that ring right there
i know it's real, it's gotta be real
man, you the flyest nigga i seen in my life 
yo man, i just wanna roll with you man
how can i be down?
what's up? you say you wanna be down?
ease back, or muthafucka get beat down
out my face, fool i'm the illest
bulletproof, i die harder than bruce willis
got my crew in effect, i bought em new jags
so much cash, gotta keep it in hefty bags
all i think about is keys and gs
imagine that, me workin at mickey d's  ha ha ha ha 
that's a joke cause i'm never gonna be broke
when i die there'll be bullets and gunsmoke
ya don't like my lifestyle? fuck you 
i'm rollin with the new jack crew
and i'm a hustler
h u s t l e r hustler
new jack, new jack..........
here i come, so you better break north
as i stride, my gold chains glide back and forth
i care nothing bout you, and that's evident
all i love's my dope and dead presidents
sound crazy? well it isn't
the ends justifies the means, that's the system
i learned that in school then i dropped out
hit the streets, checked a grip, and now i got clout
i had nothing, and i wanted it
you had everything, and you flaunted it
turned the needy into the greedy
with cocaine, my success came speedy
got me twisted, jammed into a paradox
every dollar i get, another brother drops
maybe that's the plan, and i don't understand
but since i don't know, and i ain't never learned
i gotta get paid, i got money to earn
with my posse, out on the ave
bump my sounds, crack a forty and laugh
cool out and watch my new benz gleam
is this a nightmare? or the american dream?
so think twice if you're coming down my block
you wanna journey through hell? well shit gets hot
pregnant teens, children's screams
life is weighed on the scales of a triple beam
you don't come here much, and ya better not
wrong move  bang , ambulance cot
i gotta get more money than you got
so what, if some muthafucka gets shot?
that's how the game is played
another brother slayed, the wound is deep
but they're givin us a band aid
my education's low but i got long dough
raised like a pit bull, my heart pumps nitro
sleep on silk, lie like a politician
my uzi's my best friend, cold as a mortician
lock me up, it's genocidal catastrophe
there'll be another one after me 
a hustler
hustler
h u s t l e r hustler
new jack, new jack......

i know perfect timing feels like i'm too late
and i know i'm still great in spite of my mistakes
you know it's authentic, every rhyme i say
my only regret is i made niggas wait
see, ain't too many like us, we like vintage bape
and i don't fuck with busters, i can't integrate
grew up with these killers in my living space
lotta niggas folded through them village days
citywide, gang and junction police raids
l.a. times, rollin 60s, made the front page
i vowed to never let you ditch and seal my fate
sellin' dope with hopes to graduate to real estate
i knew i was drummin' to a different beat
felt it in my stomach, i was just unique
we decided we gon' let these digits speak
then we turn slauson into venice beach
s 600 maybach, platinum dealer plates
wake up in this penthouse to the cityscape
you know it's authentic, every shit i say
i knew self destruction ain't the only way
sometimes perfect timing feels like i'm too late
but  i know you still great in spite of your mistakes
before you run your race you gotta find a pace
just make sure you cross the line, and fuck the time it takes
i got out the county jail 2008
couple months, i dropped the tape then i was on my way
my first single out, it set the streets ablaze
on location, shot that video in front the cage
tryna find my way through this fuckin' maze
every concert, hundred niggas on the stage
i'm still active so it's really just another day
promoters paranoid to book you, that affects ya pay
and when you stop eatin', that affects your weight
and when you get hungry, that affects your brain
see me i'm not trippin', i respect the game
i hope y'all do, if i can't make it, i'm gon' take your chain
see ain't too many like us, we like vintage bape
and i don't fuck with busters i can't integrate
i know perfect timing feels like i'm too late
but every single time i drop they tell me i'm the great

we done took a dream and turned it to a zenith
anything i want and everything i needed
gotta pace yourself, it's all about yo' breathin'
you can have it all, it's all about your reason
i done took my name and carved it in the cement

oh baby it's been soo long, oohh
oh baby it's been soo long, oohh

i flashback on that shootout at the beach, twenty deep
you tried to squeeze, your gun jammed and they released
blood on your tee, how many stains? i see three
the bitch started to panic so i made her switch seats
drivin' now, police chopper ahead flyin' now
really not too spooked, calmly asked me, "am i dyin' now?"
all i know is keep you calm and collected
crackin' jokes like, "nigga, now you gon' be finally respected"
see your blood leakin', got my foot on this gas
tossed the .40, we pull up to daniel free and see crash
you know the alibi, they started shootin', we was standin' by
ain't see nothing, but the flare from the talons fly
"i wasn't there, i was passin' by"
matter fact, don't say shit, i'm just gon' drop you in the back and slide
that's yo weed, all the cash is mine
i take 'em both to the spot plus your phone til you back online

oh baby it's been soo long, oohh
oh baby it's been soo long, oohh


we stayed up all night watching the comedy show
that aged whiskey and hydro
good lord, what a nice conversation
i'm too floored to get anywhere safely
you know i talk about you highly
i'm fascinated for the time being
we can laugh until the morning
or we can dance in the hallway

only one more night in los angeles
i really thought that i can handle it
but the funny thing is, i was holding back tears
i didn't think this day would happen
i'd give all this up for a chance at it
you would have thought i'd be the man for this
but the funny thing is, we can never stay here
i didn't think this day could happen

but i'ma ride it 'til it's over
i'ma ride it 'til it's over
i'ma ride it 'til it's over
i'ma ride it 'til it's over

i'ma ride, i'ma ride
ride, i'ma ride it 'til it's over
i'ma ride, i'ma ride
i'ma ride, i'ma ride

and don't all this new music sound the same?
yeah, we must be getting old and grey
we left early, girl, that band was shitty anyway
we went home and left our clothes up in the living space, aye
would you stay if your heart had the power?
would you run and find another life to imitate?
it's important that we make the best of short time
you could never be my one and only, anyway
say, can't a young man dream?
can't we all live the life on a widescreen?
what's the point? yeah
yeah, we had fun, if only for the time being

but i'ma ride it 'til it's over
i'ma ride it 'til it's over
i'ma ride it 'til it's over
i'ma ride it 'til it's over

i'ma ride, i'ma ride
ride, i'ma ride it 'til it's over
i'ma ride, i'ma ride
i'ma ride, i'ma ride

i'ma ride it 'til it's over
i'ma ride it 'til it's over
i'ma ride it 'til it's over
i'ma ride it 'til it's over

i'ma ride, i'ma ride
ride, i'ma ride it 'til it's over
i'ma ride, i'ma ride
i'ma ride, i'ma ride

you can't create, you just wait to take, my tapes  bing  
laced with malice, hands get calloused
from gripping microphones from here to dallas
go ask alice if you don't believe me
i get innervisions like stevie
see me, ascend from the chalice like the weed be
indeed we like khalid muhammad
mcs make me vomit; i get controversial
freak your style with no rehearsal
au contraire mon frere, don't you even go there
me without a mic is like a beat without a snare
i dare to tear into your ego, we go
way back like some ganja and pelequo
or coleco vision, my rhymes make incisions in your anatomy
and i'll back this with deuteronomy
or leviticus, god made this word, you can't get with this
sweet like licorice, dangerous like syphilis, yeah

how many mics do we rip on the daily
say, me say many money say me say many many many
how many mics do we rip on the daily
many money say me say many many many

i used to be underrated now i take iron
makes my shit constipated, i'm more concentrated
so on my day off, with david sonnenberg i play golf
run through crown heights screaming out, mazel tov 
problem with no man; before black, i'm first human
appetite to write like frederick douglass with a slave hand
street pressure, word to poppa, i ain't goin' under
one day i'll have a label and make deals with tommy mottola
momma always told me, "you're one in a million"
always watch your back, never tangle with haitian sicilians
now i got a record deal, "how does it feel?"
i'm never gonna survive unless i get crazy like seal
'cause the whole world's out of order
so at night the fiends dance on grease with john travolta
one got slaughtered as he coughed blood from his mouth
the other tried to duck and caught a left with my guinness stout
brother, brother, can't you get this through your head?
this is set up by the feds, they're scoping us with their infra reds

how many mics do we rip on the daily
say, me say many money say me say many many many
how many mics do we rip on the daily
many money say me say many many many

too many mc's, not enough mics
exit your show like i exit the turnpike
dicin' dynamite like dolomite
double do's been like i don't dick van dyke
star light to star bright the freaks come out at night
like my man wyclef  i wear my sunglasses at night 
and my panache will mosh your entourage
squash the squad and hide their bodies under my garage
and when the cops come lookin, i be bookin to brooklyn
leave the trails broken flippin' tokens to hoboken
a clean getaway like alec baldwin
driving in my fast car playing tracy chapman

how many mics do we rip on the daily
say, me say many money say me say many many many
how many mics do we rip on the daily
many money say me say many many many

nitt da gritt, rgf productions
squad


and mother, i am sorry, i never pick up, mm hmm
because i'm afraid to disappoint ooh, ooh ah, ooh, no

hey, and i've been feelin' like i don't matter how i used to
hey, and i've been feelin' like i don't matter how i used to

we were sat outside on the harvard floor
with our feet in dirt, and our hearts in awe
i be losin' sleep thinkin' 'bout missed calls
and i see the names circling our thoughts
and i think about if we lose it all
and i turn to shit that you'd never want
like the smoke, the drink, anything at all
and i'll say again, "sorry i don't call"
there's no money on my mind
but my money or my mind
what's the first to fall?
i never wanted this shit, yeah

hey, and i've been feelin' like i don't matter how i used to
hey, and i've been feelin' like i don't matter how i used to

sometimes, it be so spot on it hurts
like when auntie couldn't decide
between going to work or church
i've been in my feelings on an island in the dirt
i feel like brothers lie just so my feelings don't get hurt
i said, i'll try vacationing, i'll try to run away
i deleted facebook, i'll trade fame any day
for a quiet texas place and a barbecue plate
i'll switch my place if that's good for you, is that good for you?
my ghost still haunt you, my life is i, tonya
a big eyed monster, only face to conquer
i hated songs about fame 'cause that stuff meant nothin'
until them headlines came, then first flight i'm stuck in

and maybe it means nothing
but i have to say i think about you often
and if you want no part with me
i'll walk away, i know that i have wronged you
and maybe it means nothing
but i have to say i think about you often
and if you want no part with me
i'll walk away, i know that i have wronged you

i took a plane to somewhere that i've never been
too many times without my sister and my brother
dad or mother by my side but they're in spirit
i always hear it, i know they feel it
my mom will always have these dreams
that used to keep her up at night
i smoke to keep them all away and make use of the time
i'm void of feelin'
the reasons i'm so out of touch now start revealin'
but i'm not ashamed, i'm not afraid of who i am
or how i trust my mental, yeah, it's not perfect
but i guess that's just the shit i'm into
i fantasize about a time when everything was simple
my shelter sheltered me from things i needed to commit to
the way it stands to me
a victim of stockholm in my friendships and family

what's costin' your time? what's the reason that you whine?
what's in your wallet? dead whites in mine
so sour, in this light of lime
daddy said "study or get that cash"
mommy said "your career ain't gon' last"
loose change, call a cab, move out their pad
i just need a chance to move past my past
don't think too fast, private jets still crash
and i'll still fly coach, and i'll still hit a roach
and i'll still see roaches at the crib where my folks at
touch your dreams 'fore you touch me and provoke a man
 somebody's gonna have to tell the truth and i'm gonna tell it  

i will
i will
 i don't matter 
i will
 ahh 
can i tell you now?
can i tell you now?
i will

i was nothing but good to you
made some mistakes, but i still love you
i guess i couldn't do for you
the things you wanted me to
and when i said that i apologize
i meant every line i spoke
i couldn't do for you
the things you wanted me to
ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
guess i couldn't do for you
the things you wanted me to
but still, i'm here
tryna understand the way that you could let me in
and expect us to be perfect
but nothing that way's ever worth it
worth the fight, the fall
why would we not risk it all?
and when it's not perfect
you know that there's discernment
but tell you that somebody really loves you
and they're not here to play you
but you... couldn't see past my views
and when it came down to me and my wrongs
man, it hurt to know that i purchased them on my own
i was nothing but good to you
made some mistakes, but i still love you
i guess i couldn't do for you
the things you wanted me to
like not to screw up from time and time again
to be in love and lie
i guess i couldn't do for you
the things you wanted me to
so i stand here alone
in the midst of singing this song
knowing that i couldn't do for you
the things you wanted me to
ooh, ooh, for, ooh
yes, i couldn't do for you
the things you want me to
but it doesn't mean i don't love you
i do


i see us in the park
strolling the summer days of imaginings in my head
and words from my heart told only to the wind
felt even without being said

i don't wanna bore you with my troubles, yeah
but there's something about your love
that makes me weak and knocks me off my feet
there's something about your love
that makes me weak and knocks me off my feet, knocks me off my feet
and i don't wanna bore you with it
oh but i love you, i love you, i love you
i don't wanna bore you with it
oh but i love you, i love you, i love you, more and more

we lay beneath the stars under a lover's tree
that seems through the eyes of my mind
i reach out for the part of me that lives in you
that only our two hearts can find

  2x 
i don't wanna bore you with it
oh but i love you, i love you, i love you
i don't wanna bore you with it
oh but i love you, i love you


you abandoned me
love don't live here anymore  oh no 
just a vacancy
love don't live here anymore  no no 

when you lived inside of me
there was nothing i could conceive
that you wouldn't do for me
trouble seemed so far away
you changed that right away

you've abandoned me
love don't live here anymore  oh no no 
just a vacancy
love don't live here anymore  oh no, oh no 

love dont live here anymore
just emptiness and memories of
what we had before
you went away
found another place to stay, another home

you've abandoned me
love don't live here anymore  no no, no 
just a vacancy
love don't live here anymore  oh, oh 

through the windows of my eyes
everyone can see the loneliness
inside of me
why'd you have to go away?
don't you know i miss you so
i need your love

you've abandoned me
love don't live here anymore  oh, oh 
just a vacancy
love don't live here anymore  oh, oh, oh, oh 
you've abandoned me
love don't live here anymore  oh, oh 
just a vacancy
love don't live here anymore  oh, oh 

love don't love here
love don't live here anymore
love don't live here
love don't live here anymore
love don't love here
love don't live here anymore
love don't live here
love don't live here anymore

smokin' weed in bambú, sippin' on private stock

sold out seats to hear biggie smalls speak
living life without fear

stereotypes of a black male misunderstood
and it's still all good

repeat it very quickly in a crew, for example
overseer, overseer, overseer, overseer
officer, officer, officer, officer
yeah, officer from overseer
you need a little clarity? check the similarity 
the overseer rode around the plantation
the officer is off, patrollin' all the nation
the overseer could stop you, "what you're doing?"
the officer will pull you over just when he's pursuing
the overseer had the right to get ill
and if you fought back, the overseer had the right to kill
the officer has the right to arrest
and if you fight back they put a hole in your chest
 woop   they both ride horses
after 400 years, i've got no choices
the police them have a likkle gun
so when i'm on the streets, i walk around with a bigger one
 woop woop   i hear it all day
just so they can run the light and be upon their way

woop woop  that's the sound of da police
woop woop  that's the sound of da beast
woop woop  that's the sound of da police
woop woop  that's the sound of da beast

check out the message in a rough stylee
the real criminal are the c o p
you check for undercover and the one p.d
but just a mere black man, them wann check me
them check out me car, for it shine like the sun
but them jealous or them vexed,  cause them can't afford one
black people still slaves up 'til today
but the black police officer nah see it that way
him want a salary, him want it
so he put on a badge and kill people for it
my grandfather had to deal with the cops
my great grandfather dealt with the cops
my great grandfather had to deal with the cops
and then my great, great, great, great when it's gonna stop? 

woop woop  that's the sound of da police
woop woop  that's the sound of da beast
woop woop  that's the sound of da police
woop woop  that's the sound of da beast

trash men didn't get my trash today
oh, why? because they want more pay
buses on strike want a raise in fare
so they can help pollute the air
but that's what makes the world go round
the ups and downs, the carousel
changing people, they'll go around
go underground, young man
people make the world go round
wall street losin' dough on every share
they're blaming it on longer hair
big men smokin' in their easy chairs
on a fat cigar without a care
but that's what makes the world go round
the ups and downs, the carousel
changing people, they'll go around
go underground, young man
people make the world go round
but that's what makes the world go round
the ups and downs, the carousel
changing people, they'll go around

i heard a call from the mountain top: "joba "
so i put my cloak on and i walked
coined a peasant in the grasslands with a wand
cast my spells with some peasants, now we roam
we left our shanties in the village with nowhere to go
just a group of outcasts with the gift of hope
well, now we're eating grapes, and the finest cheese
achieving wisdom from the wizards we were trying to be
now other people from my village want to come with me
the thing with magic is you cannot have it if you don't believe
you did not believe, they did not believe
you can't tell me things, this was all foreseen
you're not one with me
i bought a horse with the shillings that you took
and then gave back to me
i met the queen that you praise so much, she's into me
i bought a castle in the shire with the moat and the catapult
i keep it clean with my medieval flow

pulling every card out the cuff, no bluff is enough to discuss
i won't be the one to rush that shift
couldn't crush my gift even if i'm in a thousand pieces
listening to menaces that pledge allegiance
to my every weakness, why they spreading secrets?
called my dreams facetious, bet they can't believe this
or they act like the world shoulda knew about me
all i know is they wanted to move without me
how they used to doubt me, but you can t renounce me
like la, la, la, la

o.c.    time s up 



you lack
the minerals and vitamins, irons and the niacin
fuck who did i offend.  rappers, sit back.  i m  bout to begin
 bout foul talk you squawk, never even walked the walk
more less destined to get tested, never been arrested
my album will manifest many things that i saw, did
or heard about, all told firsthand, never word of mouth
what s in the future for the fusion in the changer?  rappers are
in danger.  who will use wits to be a remainder?
when the missile is aimed to blow you out of the frame
some will keep their limbs and some will be maimed.  the same
suckers with the gab about killer instincts will turn
bitch and knowing damn well they lack in this division
the connoisseur cracking your head with a 4 by 4
realize, sucker, i ll be the coming like noah, always
simmer you down, perpetrating fa ade and what you
consider an image.  to me, this is just a scrimmage
i m feel i m stone, not  cause i bop or wear my cap cocked
the more emotion i put into it, the harder i rock
those who pose lyrical but really ain t true, i feel

 their time s limited, hardrocks  too    sample from slick rick    hey young world   x3 

speaking in tongues about what you did but you never done it
admit it: you bit it  cause the next man gained platinum
behind it.  i find it ironic, so i researched
and analyzed.  most write about stuff they fantasized
i m fed up with the bull on this focus of weed and clips
and glocks getting cocked, and wax not being flipped
it s the same old, same old just straining from the anal
the content is not complexed or vexed, so why
you pushing it?  why you lying for?  i know where you live
i know your folks.  you was a sucker as a kid
your persona s drama that you acquired in high school
in acting class, your whole aura is plexiglas
what s her face told me you shot this kid last week in the park
that s a lie you was in church with your moms.  see, i
know.  yo, slow your roll, give a  good to go 
guys be lacking in this thing called  rapping just for dough 
of course we got to pay rent, so money connects, but, uh
i d rather be broke and have a whole lot of respect
it s the principle of it.  i get a rush when i bust
some dope lines i wrote that maybe somebody ll quote
that s what i consider real in this field of music
instead of putting braincells to work, they abuse it
non conceptual, nonexceptional
everybody s either crime related or sexual
i m here to make a difference, besides all the riffing
to traps i m not sticking.  rappers, stop flipping
for those who pose lyrical but really ain t true, i feel

 their time s limited, hardrocks  too    sample from slick rick    hey young world   x3

it's just the way she's so raw and uncut
she needs a spankin' to shake her up
and i just wish that i could open her up
to this deeper place of love
high priced snake skin on her arm  oooh 
lace satin covering up her charms
you shoulda seen the way they tossed and turned
the way she made the congregation squirm

girl's got a worldly view
apparently she sees through you
her love was never meant to share for two
she said i'll do it if you'll be my sugah daddy

take a note from my philosophy
i'ma give her what she need
can't snatch the meat out of the lioness mouth
sometimes you gotta just
ease it out
i give her a pacifier
i fill my baby's crib with all the sweetness daddy wants to give
and when it comes to rocking her to sleep, i'll never tire
this is the way i clap my baby on the butt
she had me hooked with only just one glance
she need a spankin', baby, that's wussup
lawd, lawd
you say you wanna be the one she chooses to star in her meaningless romance

girl's got a worldly view
what's a sassy girl to do
and if the decision was left up to me
you best believe that i would be her sugah daddy
brown eyes that will make you blue
eyes that'll see right through you
she crossed her fingers when she said her vows
she said i promise that i'll sock it to you daddy

so i take the child to my crib
i ain't gonna tell you what we did
i hit it so i made the pussy fart
she said it's talkin' to ya, talkin' to ya daddy

parisian linen garb and cashmere shirts


whose crew was realist? shot up the movie theaters?
times square '88, whose crew was in it?
 photographed was?  sittin' on wood wicker chairs
40oz in the lap, givin' off wicked stares
punch out kings, bustin' pistols in the air
hangin' out a cutlass supreme window like "bitch, come here"
girls cussing back at us with the fattest asses
like, "who you calling bitch?  little black bastards "
we had to wave the flag, here come they baby dad
drug dealers in the crazy jag looking crazy mad
they all thought they was sparkle, fucking killer men
but we was all black seeds as fred williamson

and if not, they scarred, so they will never forget me
lord, forgive me
the hennessy got me not knowin' how to act
i'm fallin' and i can't turn back
or maybe it's the words from my man killa black
that i can't say so it's left a untold fact
until my death, my goal's to stay alive
survival of the fit, only the strong survive

yo, yo, we livin' this 'til the day that we die
survival of the fit, only the strong survive
 we still livin' it 
we livin' this 'til the day that we die
survival of the fit, only the strong survive
 thug life, we still livin' it 
we livin' this 'til the day that we die
survival of the fit, only the strong survive
 we still livin' it 
we livin' this 'til the day that we die
survival of the fit, only the strong survive

i'm trapped, in between two worlds, tryin' to get dough
y'know, when the dough get low the jewels go
but never that, as long as fiends smoke crack
i'll be on the block hustlin', countin' my stacks
no doubt, watchin' my back and proceed with caution
five oh lurkin', no time to get lost in the system
niggas usin' fake names to get out quick
my brother did it and got bagged with two ounces
i live a world where squads hit the block hard
ask my man twin when he got bagged
that fucked me up, god, but shit happens for a reason
you find out who's your true peoples
when you're upstate bleedin'
you can't find a shorty to troop your bid with you
hit with a two to four is difficult
wild on the streets, i try to maintain
tight with my loot,  cause hoes like to run game
some niggas like to trick, but i ain't with that trickin' shit
i'm like a jew, savin' dough so i can big whip
pushin' a lex, now i'm set, ready to jet
no matter how much loot i get
i'm stayin' in the projects forever
jakes on the blocks we out clever
if beef, we never separate and pull together
when worse comes to worst, my peoples come first
try to react and get them motherfuckin' feelings hurt
my crew's all about loot fuck lookin' cute 
i'm strictly timb boots and army certified suits
puffin l's, laid back, enjoyin' the smell
in the bridge, gettin' down, it ain't hard to tell
you better realize

yo, yo, we livin' this 'til the day that we die
survival of the fit, only the strong survive
 we still livin' it 
we livin' this 'til the day that we die
survival of the fit, only the strong survive
 thug life, we still livin' it 
we livin' this 'til the day that we die
survival of the fit, only the strong survive
 we still livin' it 
we livin' this 'til the day that we die
survival of the fit, only the strong survive

open your eyes and get wise
look alive, in '95, word up
hypnotic thug life, get that ass paralyzed
nomsayin? mobb deep and all that



yeah, yeah
ayo, black, it's time, word  word, it's time, man 
it's time, man  aight, man, begin 
yeah, straight out the fuckin' dungeons of rap
where fake niggas don't make it back
i don't know how to start this shit, yo... now

rappers   i monkey flip 'em with the funky rhythm i be kickin'
musician, inflictin', composition
of pain, i'm like scarface sniffin' cocaine
holdin' an m16, see with the pen i'm extreme
now, bullet holes left in my peepholes
i'm suited up in street clothes, hand me a 9 and i'll defeat foes
y'all know my steelo, with or without the airplay
i keep some e j, sittin' bent up in the stairway
or either on the corner bettin' grants with the cee lo champs
laughin' at base heads, tryna sell some broken amps...
g packs get off quick, forever niggas talk shit
reminiscin' about the last time the task force flipped
niggas be runnin' through the block shootin'
time to start the revolution, catch a body, head for houston
once they caught us off guard, the mac 10 was in the grass, and
i ran like a cheetah, with thoughts of an assassin
picked the mac up, told brothers "back up "   the mac spit
lead was hittin' niggas, one ran, i made him backflip
heard a few chicks scream, my arm shook, couldn't look
gave another squeeze, heard it click, "yo, my shit is stuck "
tried to cock it, it wouldn't shoot, now i'm in danger
finally pulled it back and saw 3 bullets caught up in the chamber
so, now i'm jettin' through the buildin' lobby
and it was full of children, prob'ly couldn't see as high as i be
 so, what you sayin'? 
it's like the game ain't the same
got younger niggas pullin' the triggers, bringin' fame to their name
and claim some corners, crews without guns are goners
in broad daylight, stick up kids, they run up on us
0.45 s and gauges, mac's in fact
same niggas will catch you back to back, snatchin' your cracks in black
there was a snitch on the block gettin' niggas knocked
so hold your stash 'til the coke price drop
i know this crackhead who said she got to smoke nice rock
and if it's good she'll bring you customers and measuring pots, but yo
you gotta slide on a vacation
inside information keeps large niggas erasin' and their wives basin'
it drops deep as it does in my breath
i never sleep, 'cause sleep is the cousin of death
beyond the walls of intelligence, life is defined
i think of crime when i'm in the new york state of mind

new york state of mind
new york state of mind
new york state of mind

be havin' dreams that i'm a gangsta, drinkin' mo ts, holdin' tec's
makin' sure the cash came correct, then i stepped
investments in stocks, sewin' up the blocks to sell rocks
winnin' gunfights with mega cops
but just a nigga walkin' with his finger on the trigger
make enough figures until my pockets get bigger
i ain't the type of brother made for you to start testin'
give me a smith   wesson, i have niggas undressin'
thinkin' of cash flow, buddha and shelter
whenever frustrated, i'ma hijack delta
in the pj's, my blend tape plays, bullets are strays
young bitches is grazed, each block is like a maze
full of black rats trapped plus the island is packed
from what i hear in all the stories when my peoples come back
black, i'm livin' where the nights is jet black
the fiends fight to get crack, i just max, i dream i can sit back
and lamp like capone, with drug scripts sewn
or the legal luxury life, rings flooded with stones, homes
i got so many rhymes, i don't think i'm too sane
life is parallel to hell, but i must maintain
and be prosperous, though we live dangerous
cops could just arrest me, blamin' us: we're held like hostages
it's only right that i was born to use mics
and the stuff that i write is even tougher than dykes
i've taken rappers to a new plateau
through rap slow, my rhymin' is a vitamin held without a capsule
the smooth criminal on beat breaks
never put me in your box if your shit eats tapes
the city never sleeps, full of villains and creeps
that's where i learned to do my hustle, had to scuffle with freaks
i'm a addict for sneakers, 20s of buddha and bitches with beepers
in the streets i can greet ya, about blunts i teach ya
inhale deep like the words of my breath
i never sleep 'cause sleep is the cousin of death
i lay puzzle as i backtrack to earlier times
nothing's equivalent to the new york state of mind

new york state of mind
new york state of mind
new york state of mind
new york state of mind

we got the jazz, we got the jazz
we got the jazz, we got the jazz
we got the jazz, we got the jazz
we got the jazz, we got the jazz

stern firm and young with a laid back tongue
the aim is to succeed and achieve at 21
just like ringling brothers, i'll daze and astound
captivate the mass, cause the prose was profound
do it for the strong, we do it for the meek
boom it in your boom it in your boom it in your jeep
or your honda or your beemer or your legend or your benz
the rave of the town to your foes and your friends
so push it, along, trails, we blaze
don't deserve the gong, don't deserve the praise
the tranquility will make you unball your fist
for we put hip hop on a brand new twist
a brand new twist with a whole heap of mystic
so low key that you probably missed it
and yet it's so loud that it stands in the crowd
when the guy takes the beat, they bowed
so raise up squire, adjust your attire
we have no time to wallow in the mire
if you're on a foreign path, then let me do the lead
join in the essence of the cool out breed
then cool out to the music cause it makes you feel serene
with the birds and the bees and all those groovy things
like getting stomach aches when you gotta go to work
or staring into space when you're feeling berserk
i don't really mind if it's over your head
cause the job of resurrectors is to wake up the dead
so pay attention, it's not hard to decipher
and after the horns, you can check out the phifer

we got the jazz, we got the jazz
we got the jazz, we got the jazz
we got the jazz, we got the jazz
we got the jazz, we got the jazz

competition dem try fe come side way
but competition they must come straight way
competition dem try fe come side way
but competition they must come straight way
how's about that, it seems like it's my turn again
all through the years my mic has been my best friend
i know some brothers wonder, can phife really kick it?
some even wanna dis me, but why sweat it?
i'm all into my music cos it's how i make papes
try to make hits, like kid capri makes tapes
me sweat another? i do my own thing
strictly hardcore tracks, not a new jack swing
i grew up as a christian so to jah i give thanks
collect my banks, listen to shabba ranks
i sing, and chat, i do all of that
it's 1991 and i refuse to come wack
i take off my hat to other crews that tend to rock
but the low end theory's here, it's time to wreck shop
i got tip and shah, so whom shall i fear
stop look and listen, but please don't stare
so jet to the store, and buy the lp
on jive rca, cassettes and cd's
produced and arranged by the four man crew
and oh shit, skeff anselm, he gets props too
make sure you have a system with some fat house speakers
so the new shit can rock, from bronx to massapequa
cause where i come from quality is job one
and everybody up on linden know we get the job done
so peace to that crew, and peace to this crew
bring on the tour, we'll see you at a theatre nearest you

hey yo but wait, back it up, hup, easy back it up
please let the abstract embellish on the cut
back and forth just like a cameo song
if you dig this joint then please come dance along
to the music cause it's done just for the rhyme
now i gotta scat and get mine, underline
the jazz, the what? the jazz can move that ass
cause the tribe originates that feeling of pizazz
it's the universal sound, bless the brothers on the ground
and the ones six below, you didn't have to go
some say that i'm eccentric cause i once had an orgy
and sometimes for breakfast i eat grits and porgies
if this is a stinker, then call me a skunk, i ask
 "what's, wrong?"  now check it out

all my peoples in queens ya don't stop
now all my peoples in brooklyn ya don't stop
and all my peoples uptown ya don't stop

part 2: i tried

got a letter from an old flame the other day
envelope, had a scent reminiscent of may
said she s doing just fine, that i ve been on her mind and
that she wishes that i never ever went away
i gave it all i had just to let it go
but you should know that i tried

i tried, i tried
i tried, just know that i tried
that i tried, i tried
i tried

got a call from an old friend the other night
he said that he just saw you, and you re living the life
we were always best friends
it all came to an end and things change
one day i hope you realize

i tried, i tried
i tried, i tried
girl, i tried, yeah, i tried
i tried, i tried

maybe one day we ll find common ground
when the weather s warm and the trees are green
maybe when the leaves start falling
maybe then we ll find ourselves together again

that s it, my seeds are there in your garden
i fell in love with smoke and mirrors
the spring, i guess we ll see if we blossom
or are we just fallen petals? is it autumn?

maybe one day we ll find common ground
when the ocean s cold and the pigs all fly
maybe when the sky starts falling


we've been through it all, though it could be worse
we've been moved around in a state of alert
there's nothing new or sharp about the cutting edge
if they build a wall, let's jump the fence, i'm over this

cold stares can never put the fear in me
what we built here is godly
they can't gentrify the heart of kings
let's just not talk about it
if i make a move, you're coming with me

what about the love? coming with me
what about the labor? coming with me
what about the seed? it's coming with me

we couldn't stand to see our children shot dead in the streets
but when i finally took a knee
them crackers took me out the league
now i'm not much for games
but i play for keeps
and we salute king james for using his change
to create some equal opportunities

cold stares can never put the fear in me
there's a movement we've been groovin' on
you can move or stay your ass asleep
let's just not talk about it
everything they tried to hide
we're taking back for yours and mine

what about the love? coming with me
what about the labor? coming with me
what about the seed? it's coming with me
people that you came with coming with me
what about the love? coming with me
what about the labor? coming with me
