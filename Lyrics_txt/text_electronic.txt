i wish that we could talk about it
but there, that's the problem
with someone new i could have started
too late for beginnings
the little things that made me nervous
are gone in a moment
i miss the way we used to argue
locked in your basement

i wake up and the phone is ringing
surprised, as it's early
and that should be a perfect warning
that something's a problem
to tell the truth, i saw it coming
the way you were breathing
but nothing can prepare you for it
the voice on the other end

the worst is all the lovely weather
i'm stunned it's not raining
the coffee isn't even bitter
because what's the difference?
there's all the work that needs to be done
it's late for revision
there's all the time and all the planning
and songs to be finished

and it keeps coming and it keeps coming
and it keeps coming 'til the day it stops
and it keeps coming and it keeps coming
and it keeps coming 'til the day it stops
and it keeps coming and it keeps coming
and it keeps coming and it keeps coming
and it keeps coming and it keeps coming
and it keeps coming 'til the day it stops

i wish that we could talk about it
but there, that's the problem
with someone new i could have started
too late for beginnings
you're smaller than my wife imagined
surprised you were human
there shouldn't be this radio silence
but what are the options?

when someone great is gone, when someone great is gone
when someone great is gone, when someone great is gone
when someone great is gone, when someone great is gone
when someone great is gone, when someone great is gone
we're safe
for the moment
saved
for the moment

i can't get no sleep
i can't get no sleep
i need to sleep, i can't get no sleep
 i need to sleep 
deep in the bosom of the gentle night
is when i search for the light, pick up my pen and start to write
i struggle and fight dark forces in the clear moonlight
without fear.. insomnia..
i can't get no sleep
i can't get no sleep
i used to worry, thought i was going mad in a hurry
gettin' stressed makin' excess mess in darkness
no electricity, something's all over me
greasy insomnia, please release me and let me dream of
makin' mad love to my girl on the heath
tearin' off tights with my teeth
but there's no release, no peace, i toss and turn without cease
like a curse, open my eyes, rise like yeast
at least a couple of weeks since i last slept, kept takin' sleepers..
but now i keep myself pepped
deeper still, the night, i write by candle light i find insight
from the mental movement
so when it's black, this insomniac takes an original tack
keep the beast in my nature under ceaseless attack.. i gets no sleep..
i can't get no sleep
i can't get no sleep
i can't get no sleep
i need to sleep, i can't get no sleep..
i need to sleep, i can't get no sleep...


oh yeah
what we're living in
let me tell ya

and it's a wonder man can eat at all
when things are big that should be small
who can tell what magic spells we'll be doing for us
and i'm giving all my love to this world
only to be told
i can't see
i can't breathe
no more will we be
and nothing's going to change the way we live
'cause we can always take but never give
and now that things are changing for the worse
see, it's a crazy world we're living in
and i just can't see that half of us immersed in sin
is all we have to give these  

future's made of virtual insanity
now always seem to, be governed by this love we have
for useless, twisting, our new technology
oh, now there is no sound
for we all live underground

and i'm thinking what a mess we're in
hard to know where to begin
if i could slip the sickly ties that earthly man has made
and now every mother, can choose the colour
of her child
that's not nature's way
well that's what they said yesterday
there's nothing left to do but pray
i think it's time i found a new religion
whoa, it's so insane to synthesize another strain
there's something in these futures that we have to be told

future's made of virtual insanity
now always seem to, be governed by this love we have
for useless, twisting, our new technology
oh, now there is no sound
for we all live underground

now there is no sound
if we all live underground
and now it's virtual insanity
forget your virtual reality
oh, there's nothing so bad
oh yeah, i know yeah

of this virtual insanity, we're livin' in
has got to change, yeah
things, will never be the same
and i can't go on
while we're livin' in oh, oh virtual insanity
oh, this world, has got to change
'cause i just, i just can't keep going on, it was virtual
virtual insanity that we're livin' in, that we're livin' in
that virtual insanity is what it is
yeah

future's made of virtual insanity
now always seem to, be governed by this love we have
for useless, twisting, our new technology
oh, now there is no sound
for we all live underground
yes we do

oh, now there's nothing that we live in
it's all  ? 
out of window, you know
there is nothing worse than a rambling man
there is nothing worse than a foolish mind
virtual insanity is what we're living in
yeah, well it's alright now


kill me if you dare
hold my head up everywhere
keep myself right on this train
i'm the underdog
live my life on a lullaby
keep myself riding on this train
keep myself riding on this train

love in technicolor, sprayed out on walls
well i've been pounding at the pavement
'til there's nothing at all
i got my cloak and dagger
in a bar room brawl
see the local loves a fighter
loves a winner to fall

feels like i'm lost in a moment
i'm always losing to win
can't get away from the moment
seems like it's time to begin

kill me if you dare
hold my head up everywhere
keep myself right on this train
i'm the underdog
live my life on a lullaby
keep myself riding on this train
keep myself riding on this train

it don't matter
i won't do what you say
you've got the money and the power
i won't go your way
i can't take for the people
they don't matter at all
and i'll be waiting in the shadows
'til the day that you fall

feels like i'm lost in a moment
i'm always losing to win
can't get away from the moment
seems like it's time  to begin

kill me if you dare
hold my head up everywhere
keep myself right on this train
i'm the underdog
live my life on a lullaby
keep myself riding on this train

tell me if you're down
throw your weapons to the ground
keep myself right on this train
paper on the wire
sold your soul for another one
keep myself riding on this train
keep myself riding on this train


finer worlds that you uncover
plant the path you want to roam
live where your heart can be given
and your life starts to unfold

you think you can't, you wish you could
i know you can, i wish you would
so trip inside this house as you pass by
trip inside this house as you pass by

if your limbs begin dissolving
in the water that you tread
all surroundings are evolving
in the stream that clears your head

come disciples to thee unending
subtleties of rhythm power
so trip inside this house as you pass by
trip inside this house as you pass by

trip, trip, trip inside
trip, trip, trip inside

sweep the shadows from your eyes
sweep the realm of dark aside
so trip inside this house as you pass by
trip inside this house as you pass by

trip, trip, trip inside
trip, trip, trip inside
trip, trip, trip inside
trip, trip, trip inside

please excuse me but i got to ask
are you only being nice because you want something?
my fairy tale arrow pierces
be careful how you respond, 'cause you might end up in this song
i never gave you an encouragement
and it's doing me in, doing me in, doing me in, doing me in

the more you try to erase me
the more, the more, the more that i appear
oh, the more, the more
the more you try the eraser
the more, the more, the more that you appear

you know all the answers so why do you ask?
i am only being nice because i want someone, something
you're like a kitten with a ball of yarn
and it's doing me in, doing me in, doing me in, doing me in

the more you try to erase me
the more, the more, the more that i appear
oh, the more, the more
the more i try to erase you
the more, the more, the more that you appear

no, you're wrong, you are wrong
you are wrong, you are wrong
you are wrong, you are wrong
you're wrong


all of my mouth was kissing him
now, into the air, i am missing him
is this excess texting a blessing?
two music nerds obsessing

he reminds me of the love in me
i'm celebrating on a vibrancy
sending each other mp3s
falling in love to a song

this handsomest of wickermen
he asked if i could wait for him
now, how many lightyears this interim
while i fall in love with his songs?

his hands are good in protecting me
touching and caressing me
but would it be trespassing
wanting him to be blissing me
robbing him of his youth?

cliffhanger like suspension
my longing has formed its own skeleton
bridging the gap between singletons
sending each others these songs

the interior of these melodies
is perhaps where we are meant to be
our physical union a fantasy
i just fell in love with a song

so, i reserve my own intimacies
i bundle them up in packages
my rawward longing far too visceral
did i just fall in love with love?


every time i leave you girl
he s the one that s near you girl, oh, i
even as i drive away
i can hear the words he ll say, oh, i

i guess i don t need her
it doesn t mean i can t get over her
where you gonna go without me tonight?
don t you know what that means to me?

you were in my dream again
and i could see you kissing him, oh, girl
why d you have to change your mind
just as i was changing mine? oh, girl

i wish i d never met you
it doesn t mean i can t get over you
what you gonna do without me tonight?
don't you know what you did to me?


what can you buy
that lifts a heavy heart up to the sky?
what makes your day?
what miracle of life
has come to stay?
a taste of love
so sweet, so real you can't let go
and how does it feel?
it feels so good...

but how much do you need?
how much, how much do you need?
how much do you need?
how much, how much do you need?
i want a nice car
a girlfriend
who's as pretty as a star
i want respect
as much, as much as i can get

restless
i feel so restless
and in this changing world
i am lost for words
i feel so restless
ain't got no interest
i couldn't care less
can't be a success

due to current studies
the fiscal climate isn't looking good
get out of town
the streets are running  rivers full of blood
the more i see
the less, the less that i believe
the more i hear
the less, the less that i perceive

restless
i feel so restless
and in this changing world
i am lost for words
i feel so restless
ain't got no interest
i couldn't care less
can't be a success
what can you buy
that lifts a heavy heart up to the sky?
what makes your day?
what miracle of life
has come to stay?
a taste of love
so sweet, so real you can't let go
and how does it feel?
it feels so good...

restless
i am so restless
and this changing world
leaves me speechless
i am lost for words
but i kept my nerve
but it's not hopeless
if you take rest


i couldn't speak so i slurred while i looked for a word
but you left just before i could find it
i sat by myself and i stared at the pictures of you on the wall

i kissed the floor, curled up in a ball
there's nothing coming out of my mouth so i said nothing at all

babe, you've got a face like thunder
always trying to get out with another
just stay still 'til i say it's over
babe, you've got a face like thunder

and you question your lover, did she really believe
that this new taste of love is obsolete?  
it just couldn't compete and so you ll keep dragging your body through life by the hair so you can say that you've been somewhere and you don't care of your receipt
you're sentenced to death and you can't be reprieved

babe, you've got a face like thunder
always trying to get out with another
just stay still 'til i say it's over
babe, you've got a face like thunder

say sorry for a while, for a while, for a while
you know i didn't mean it
i said something terrible and i tried to redeem it
i can be so cruel although i don't seem it

babe, you've got a face like thunder
always trying to get out with another
just stay still 'til i say it's over
babe, you've got a face like thunder


so as i, so as i

new shit can seem so old
real hot to cold
weakness  my weakness  plays a huge part  plays the biggest part 
my weak will  my weak will  made a stronger heart  a stronger heart, a stronger heart 
he turns  he turns me  me upside down  he's turns me upside down

hey, honey, what you trying to say?
as i stand here, don't you walk away
and the world comes tumbling down
hand in hand in a violent life
making love on the edge of a knife
and the world comes tumbling down

and it's hard for me to say
and it's hard for me to stay
i'm going down to be by myself
i'm going back for the good of my health
and there's one thing i couldn't do
sacrifice myself to you
sacrifice

baby, baby, i just can't see
just what you mean to me
i take my aim and i fake my words
i'm just your longtime curse
and if you walk away
i can't take it

but that's the way that you are
and that's the things that you say
but now you've gone too far
with all the things you say
get back to where you come from
i can't help it, under the april skies
under the april skies
under the april sun
under the april skies

under the april sun
under the april sun
under the april skies
under the april sun
under the april skies

the sun grows cold, the sky gets black
and you broke me up and now you won't come back
shaking hand, life is dead
and a broken heart and a screaming head
hey, hey

under the april skies
under the april sun
under the april skies
under the april skies

chestnuts roasting on an open fire
jack frost nipping at your nose
yuletide carols being sung by a choir
and folks dressed up like eskimos
everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
help to make the season bright
tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
will find it hard to sleep tonight
they know that santa's on his way
he's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
and every mother's child is gonna spy
to see if reindeer really know how to fly
so i'm offering this simple phrase
to kids from one to ninety two
although it's been said many times, many ways
merry christmas to you

she said "how did we get ourselves so lost?"
and i said "i don't know, but we will not be leaving tonight, tonight
when you hold me i, i feel better"
i only want one night, together in our arms

i've seen it all   there is no more to see 

you haven't seen elephants, kings or peru 
i'm happy to say i had better to do
what about china? have you seen the great wall?
all walls are great, if the roof doesn't fall 

and the man you will marry?
the home you will share?
to be honest, i really don't care...

you've never been to niagara falls?
i have seen water, it's water, that's all...
the eiffel tower, the empire state?
my pulse was as high on my very first date 
your grandson's hand as he plays with your hair?
to be honest, i really don't care...

i've seen it all, i've seen the dark
i've seen the brightness in one little spark
i've seen what i chose and i've seen what i need
and that is enough, to want more would be greed
i've seen what i was and i know what i'll be
i've seen it all   there is no more to see 

you've seen it all and all you have seen
you can always review on your own little screen
the light and the dark, the big and the small
just keep in mind   you need no more at all
you've seen what you were and know what you'll be
you've seen it all   there is no more to see 


i thought that i was dreaming when you said you loved me
the start of nothing, i had no chance to prepare
i couldn't see you coming
the start of nothing, i could hate you now
it's quite alright to hate me now
when we both know that deep down
the feeling still deep down is good

if i could see through walls, i could see you're faking
if you could see my thoughts, you would see our faces
safe in my rental like an armored truck back then
we didn't give a fuck back then
i ain't a kid no more, we'll never be those kids again
we'd drive to syd's, had the x6 back then, back then
no matter what i did, my waves wouldn't dip back then
everything sucked back then, we were friends

i thought that i was dreaming when you said you loved me
the start of nothing, i had no chance to prepare
i couldn't see you coming
the start of nothing, i could hate you now
it's quite alright to hate me now
but we both know that deep down
the feeling still deep down is good

in the halls of your hotel
arm around my shoulder so i could tell
how much i meant to you, meant it sincere back then
we had time to kill back then
you ain't a kid no more, we'll never be those kids again
it's not the same, ivory's illegal, don't you remember?

i broke your heart last week
you'll probably feel better by the weekend
still remember, had you going crazy
screaming my name, the feeling deep down is good

i thought that i was dreaming when you said you loved me
the start of nothing, had no chance to prepare
couldn't see you coming
and we started from nothing, i could hate you now
it's alright to hate me now
we both know that deep down
the feeling still deep down is good

all the things i didn't mean to say, i didn't mean to do
there were things you didn't need to say
did you mean to? mean to...
i've been dreaming of you, dreaming of you
i've been dreaming of you, dreaming of you
i've been dreaming, dreaming


i ain't easy and i make you mad
'least i ain't sleazy
i'm just trying to put the world to rights
if you want to i'll take you out
and i got the feeling
that i'm going to keep you up all 
going to keep you up all 
going to keep you up all night

tired of taking orders
coping with disorders
the wrong men have the power
it's turning my milk sour
turning my milk sour
turning my milk sour

i ain't easy and i make you mad
'least i ain't sleazy
i'm just trying to put the world to rights
if you want to i'll take you out
and i got the feeling
that i'm going to keep you up all night
i ain't easy, but i ain't that bad
no rhyme or reason
i'm just trying to set the world alight
you got problems? well, so have i
and i got the feeling
that i'm going to keep you up all 
going to keep you up all 
going to keep you up all night

there's cobras in the moshpit
finally we lost it
every day is brutal
now we're being watched by google
got to keep it simple
sending out a signal
everyone's on bugle
now we're being watched by google
being watched by google
being watched by google

i ain't easy and i make you mad
'least i ain't sleazy
i'm just trying to put the world to rights
if you want to i'll take you out
and i got the feeling
that i'm going to keep you up all night
i ain't easy, but i ain't that bad
no rhyme or reason
i'm just trying to set the world alight
you got problems? well, so have i
and i got the feeling
that i'm going to keep you up all 
going to keep you up all 
going to keep you up all night


i know it's nothing more than flutes
but something in my heart is loose
there's never been a better day
and if there is nothing more
then nothing more will add, i say
there's never been a better day

work that inside, outside, work that more

work that inside, outside, work that more

i put up on a string today
deciding never taught me a thing
a wooden box breathes the way
never again, never again
never again, never again

all this talk is getting me down
nothing's making sense in my brain
i m moving words across the terrain
trying hard to fix to the page
i m wedded to the thought that we came
only to discover our names
and blow a horn of love in refrain
and watch things drop down
and watch things drop down
and watch things drop down
and watch things drop down

work that inside, outside, work that more

one day you might realise
that you might need to open your eyes

you'll be given love
you'll be taken care of
you'll be given love
you have to trust it

maybe not from the sources
you have poured yours
maybe not from the directions
you are staring at

twist your head around
it's all around you
all is full of love
all around you

all is full of love
you just ain't receiving
all is full of love
your phone is off the hook
all is full of love
your doors are all shut
all is full of love

all is full of love, all is full of love
all is full of love, all is full of love
all is full of love
all is full of love, all is full of love
all is full of love
all is full of love
all is full of love

that's how it starts
we go back to your house
you check the charts
and start to figure it out
and if it's crowded, all the better
because we know we're gonna be up late
but if you're worried about the weather
then you picked the wrong place to stay
that's how it starts
and so it starts
you switch the engine on
we set controls for the heart of the sun
one of the ways we show our age
and if the sun comes up, if the sun comes up
if the sun comes up and i still don't wanna stagger home
then it's the memory of our betters
that are keeping us on our feet
you spent the first five years trying to get with the plan
and the next five years trying to be with your friends again
you're talking forty five turns just as fast as you can
yeah, i know it gets tired, but it's better when we pretend
it comes apart
the way it does in bad films
except in parts
when the moral kicks in
though we're running out of the drugs
and the conversation's grinding away
i wouldn't trade one stupid decision
for another five years of life
you drop the first ten years just as fast as you can
and the next ten people who are trying to be believed
when you're blowing eighty five days in the middle of this
yeah, i know it gets tired only wearing on friends tonight
to tell the truth
oh, this could be the last time
so when we go
like a sail's force into the night
and if i made a fool, if i made a fool
if i made a fool on the road, there's always this
and if i'm sewn into submission
i can still come home to this
and with a face like a dad and a laughable stand
you leave conceit on the plane or review what you said
when you're drunk and the kids look impossibly tired
you think over and over, hey, i finally did
oh, if the trip and the plan come apart in your hand
you look concerted on yourself your ridiculous prop
you forgot what you meant when you read what you said
and you always knew you were tired, but then
where are your friends tonight?
where are your friends tonight?
where are your friends tonight?
if i could see all my friends tonight
if i could see all my friends tonight
if i could see all my friends tonight
if i could see all my friends tonight


you wanted a hit
but maybe we don't do hits
i try and try, it ends up feeling kind of wrong
you wanted it tough
but is it ever tough enough?
no, nothing's ever tough enough
until we hit the road
and you wanted it lush
but honestly, you must hush
no, honestly, you know too much
so leave us, leave us on our own

you wanted a hit
well, this is how we do hits
you wanted a hit
but that's not what we do, sugar

you wanted it real
but can you tell me what's real?
we've got lights and sounds and stories, music's just a part
then you wanted the truth
and then you said you want proof
i guess you're used to liars saying what they want

still, we won't be your babies anymore
we won't be your babies anymore
we won't be your babies 'til you take us home
and we won't be your babies anymore
we won't be your babies anymore
we can't be your babies 'til you take us home

you wanted it smart
but honestly, i'm not smart
no, honestly, i'm never smart
we fake it, fake it all the time
then you wanted the time
but maybe i can't do time
we both know that's an awful line
but this doesn't make it wrong
you wanted it right
no out of mine and out of sight
no filthy bus and early flight
no seven days and forty nights

you wanted a hit
please tell me, where's the point in it?
you wanted a hit
but that's not what we do

still, we won't be your babies anymore
we won't be your babies anymore
we won't be your babies 'til you take us home
and we won't be your babies anymore
we won't be your babies anymore
we can't be your babies 'til you take us home
and we won't be your babies anymore
we won't be your babies anymore
we won't be your babies 'til you take us home
and we won't be your babies anymore
we won't be your babies anymore
we won't be your babies 'til you take us home, sugar


sssh, sssh
it's, oh, so quiet
sssh, sssh
it's oh, so still
sssh, sssh
you're all alone
sssh, sssh
and so peaceful until

you fall in love
zing boom
the sky up above
zing boom
is caving in
wow bam

you've never been so nuts about a guy
you want to laugh, you wanna cry
you cross your heart and hope to die

'til it's over, and then
sssh, sssh
it's nice and quiet
sssh, sssh
but soon again
sssh, sssh
starts another big riot

you blow a fuse
zing boom
the devil cuts loose
zing boom
so what's the use
wow bam
of falling in love?

it's, oh, so quiet
it's oh, so still
you're all alone
and so peaceful until

you ring the bell
bim bam
you shout and you yell
hi ho ho
you broke the spell

gee, this is swell, you almost have a fit
this guy is "gorge" and i got hit
there's no mistake, this is it

'til it's over and then
it's nice and quiet
sssh, sssh
but soon again
sssh, sssh
starts another big riot

you blow a fuse
zing boom
the devil cuts loose
zing boom
so what's the use
wow bam
of falling in love?

the sky caves in
the devil cuts loose
you blow, blow, blow, blow, blow your fuse
when you fall in love
sssh

ooo heh hey
oh
what we re living in
let me tell ya
it's a wonder man can eat at all
when things are big that should be small
who can tell
what magic spells
we ll be doing for us
and i m giving all my love to this world
only to be told
i can t see
i can t breathe
no more will we be
and nothing s going to change the way we live
 cause we can always take but never give
and now that things are changing for the worse, see
whoa
it s a crazy world we re living in
and i just can t see that half of us immersed in sin is all we have to give these
futures
made of
virtual insanity, now always
seem to
be governed by this love we have for, useless
twisting
of our new technology, oh now there is no sound
for we all live underground
and i m thinking what a mess we re in
hard to know where to begin
if i could slip
the sickly ties that earthly man has made
and now every mother
can choose the colour
of her child
that s not nature s way
well that s what they said yesterday
there s nothing left to do but pray
i think it s time to find a new religion
whoa, it s so insane
to synthesize another strain
there s something in these futures that we have to be told
futures
made of
virtual insanity, now always
seem to
be governed by this love we have for useless
twisting
of our new technology, oh now there is no sound
for we all live underground, whoa
now there is no sound
if we all live underground
and now it's virtual insanity
forget your virtual reality
oh
there's nothing so bad
as a man made man
oh, yeah
i know yeah
i know i can't go on
ooh
of this virtual insanity we're living in
has got to change
yeah
things
will never be the same
and i can't go on
where we're living in
oh
oh, virtual insanity
oh, this world
has got to change
'cause i just
i just can't keep going on in this virtual
virtual insanity
that we're living in
where we're living in
and that virtual insanity is what it is
yeah
ooh
futures
made of
virtual insanity, now always
seem to
be governed by this love we have for useless
twisting
of our new technology, oh now there is no sound
for we all live underground, oh
futures
made of
now virtual insanity
now we all, we seem to be governed
by a love for this useless twisting
of our new technology
and now there is no sound
for we all live underground
yes we do
oh
now this life that we live in
it's all going wrong
out of the window
do you know
that
there is nothing worse than
a man made man
i feel there's nothing worse than
a foolish man
hey
virtual insanity is what we're living in
yeah
it is alright?


heard a shout and someone calling
strained in darkness
vapour, like a veil, hangs over
the city tonight

hanging there behind the trees
a blood red moon is watching
i was waiting for you
dread in my heart

where the wind sings by the river
laughing, broken
hair swept out into the water
ripples of black

run, you better run
you better run for your life

oh, it rips through the sky
oh, a light flickers on
jo, i know you would say
 don t wait for me now 

shiver while you re breathe in
hold on while you breathe loud
i see the dawn
shiver while you breathe in
hold on while i breath loud

filigree of time demeaning
sunset, spoken
where the wind sings by the river
ripples of black

days, you gotta run
you gotta run for your life
run, you better run
you better run for your life

days, you gotta run
you gotta run for your life
run, you better run
you better run for your life

days, you gotta run
you gotta run for your life
run, you better run
you better run for your life

oh, you live 'til you breathe
don t run with me
breathe your life while you wait
don t wait for me now

instrumental


tell me, tell me
is life just a playground?
think you're the real deal, honey?
and someone will always look out for you?

but wake up, baby
you're so totally deluded
you'll end up old and lonely
if you don't get a bullet in your head

good luck, good luck
good luck in your new bed
enjoy your nightmares, honey
when you're resting your head
good luck, good luck
good luck in your new bed
enjoy your nightmares, honey
when you're resting your head

you sold me, sold me
you sold me down the river now
i hope you're feeling happy now
now you always have a sneer in your smile

but wake up, baby
you're so totally deluded
you'll end up old and lonely
if you don't get a bullet in your head

good luck, good luck
good luck in your new bed
enjoy your nightmares, honey
when you're resting your head
good luck, good luck
good luck in your new bed
enjoy your nightmares, honey
when you're resting your head

and i'm glad, so glad, that i'm done with you
no more crying, crying
leaving me so black and blue
you backed me up against the wall
but i stand tall, don't give a damn no more
oh, baby, bye bye
no more lies
no more lies
no more lies
without you

good good luck
in your new bed
enjoy your nightmares
when you're resting your head
good, good luck
in your new bed
enjoy your nightmares
good luck, good luck
good luck in your new bed
enjoy your nightmares, honey
when you're resting your head
good luck, good luck
good luck in your new bed
enjoy your nightmares, honey
when you're resting your head
good luck, good luck  good luck 
good luck in your new bed  good luck 
enjoy your nightmares, honey  good luck 
when you're resting your head  good luck

i guess we'll never get started
let's save the silence all night
no need for talking about it
sometimes, the quiet feels so right

high
over the north star
sleepless, so far
together, we are
high
trapped in the holiday affair
a new silence filled the air

i rest my head on your shoulder
there's nowhere else i'd rather be
right there, a little bit slower
feel free to roll another one for me
 roll another one for me 

high
over the north star
sleepless, so far
together, we are
high
trapped in the holiday affair
a new silence filled the air

making way, we sway, we slide, oh
one flight to space, soothing you
it's too good to be true, have more on a rooftop view
making way, we sway, we slide, oh

high
over the north star
sleepless, so far
together, we are
high
trapped in the holiday affair
a new silence filled the air

high
high
high

and i'll ask why

i can't get no sleep
i can't get no sleep
i need to sleep, i can't get no sleep
 i need to sleep 
deep in the bosom of the gentle night
is when i search for the light, pick up my pen and start to write
i struggle and fight dark forces in the clear moonlight
without fear.. insomnia..
i can't get no sleep
i can't get no sleep
i used to worry, thought i was going mad in a hurry
gettin' stressed makin' excess mess in darkness
no electricity, something's all over me
greasy insomnia, please release me and let me dream of
makin' mad love to my girl on the heath
tearin' off tights with my teeth
but there's no release, no peace, i toss and turn without cease
like a curse, open my eyes, rise like yeast
at least a couple of weeks since i last slept, kept takin' sleepers..
but now i keep myself pepped
deeper still, the night, i write by candle light i find insight
from the mental movement
so when it's black, this insomniac takes an original tack
keep the beast in my nature under ceaseless attack.. i gets no sleep..
i can't get no sleep
i can't get no sleep
i can't get no sleep
i need to sleep, i can't get no sleep..
i need to sleep, i can't get no sleep...

please excuse me but i got to ask
are you only being nice because you want something?
my fairy tale arrow pierces
be careful how you respond, 'cause you might end up in this song
i never gave you an encouragement
and it's doing me in, doing me in, doing me in, doing me in

the more you try to erase me
the more, the more, the more that i appear
oh, the more, the more
the more you try the eraser
the more, the more, the more that you appear

you know all the answers so why do you ask?
i am only being nice because i want someone, something
you're like a kitten with a ball of yarn
and it's doing me in, doing me in, doing me in, doing me in

the more you try to erase me
the more, the more, the more that i appear
oh, the more, the more
the more i try to erase you
the more, the more, the more that you appear

no, you're wrong, you are wrong
you are wrong, you are wrong
you are wrong, you are wrong
you're wrong

but nothing is, no

 woohoo   when i feel heavy metal
 woohoo   and i'm pins and i'm needles
 woohoo   well, i lie and i'm easy
all of the time but i'm never sure why i need you
pleased to meet you

i got my head down
when i was young
it's not my problem
it's not my problem

 woohoo   when i feel heavy metal
 woohoo   and i'm pins and i'm needles
 woohoo   well, i lie and i'm easy
all of the time but i'm never sure why i need you
pleased to meet you

yeah, yeah

where's the love song to set us free?
too many people down
everything turning the wrong way 'round
and i don't know what love would be
but if we stop dreaming now
lord knows we'd never clear the clouds

and you've been so busy lately
that you haven't found the time
to open up your mind
and watch the world spinning
gently out of time

feel the sunshine on your face
it's in a computer now
gone to the future way out in space

and you've been so busy lately
that you haven't found the time
to open up your mind
and watch the world spinning
gently out of time


and you've been so busy lately
that you haven't found the time

oh yeah i used to know quinnan
he's a real, he's a real jerk


when routine bites hard, ambitions are low
resentment rides high, emotions won't grow
we're changing our ways, taking different roads

love will tear us apart again
love will tear us apart again

why is the bedroom so cold? you've turned away on your side
is my timing that flawed? our respect runs so dry
yet there's still this appeal that we've kept through our lives

love will tear us apart again
love will tear us apart again

you cry out in your sleep, all my failings exposed
and there's a taste in my mouth as desperation takes hold
just that something so good just can't function no more

love will tear us apart again
love will tear us apart again
love will tear us apart again
love will tear us apart again





everyone's updating their hardware
plugging in their new gear
upgrading to all new components
replacing the things from last year
every time i hear something special
its replacement is something i fear
it's only a working in progress
only a stopgap idea
the tools that we used to create them
they're no longer welcome 'round here
everyone's re routing their cables
creating paths that are crystal clear
while i like the sound of you dreaming
i like how it sounds in my ear
and i like the sound of adventure
the wind chimes in the air
in this world you've created
there are sounds i'll always hold dear
i'd like things to be permanent
but that's not always possible, i fear
bring me something back when you go
bring me something back when you go
bring me something back i don't know
bring me something back when you go
everyone's deleting their plugins
their path must remain crystal clear
everyone's sick of their soft synths
like they're sick of cold lager beer
i don't know a real ale from a fake one
i don't know which is more sincere
the music we're making
or the music we hear
make your own kind of problems
make something out of your fears
make your own music
let it bring you to tears
bring me something back when you go
 will you ride with me for one last time? 
bring me something back when you go
 i'll be on electric lines 
bring me something back when you go
 i can hear the signal passing through 
bring me something back i don't know
 they know what we plan to do 


hold on tight, you've got a way to go
you're terrified by the open road
in a daze, you've lost control
you've found a gang
and it makes you feel better than the other girls

and you pray they're just boys, they're not villains
one's got religious tattoos, he'll be forgiven

let go, there is nothing more to hide
seeing life through closed eyes
it's just a young understanding
you know, that time is on your side
seeing life through closed eyes
it's just a young understanding

cruising round in a friend's new car
you've always know they won't get you far
found yourself on a downward slope
it's ok, cause it makes you feel better than the other girls

and you pray they're just boys, they're not villains
one's got religious tattoos, he'll be forgiven

let go, there is nothing more to hide
seeing life through closed eyes
it's just a young understanding
you know, that time is on your side
seeing life through closed eyes
it's just a young understanding

torn apart, can't you see?
they left their hearts in the 70's
reach for a sign, reach for an understanding
reach for a sign, reach for an understanding
reach for a sign, reach for an understanding
reach for a sign, reach for an understanding

let go, there is nothing more to hide
seeing life through closed eyes
it's just a young understanding
you know, that time is on your side
seeing life through closed eyes
it's just a young understanding

reach for a sign
it's just a young understanding
reach for a sign
it's just a young understanding

you drain down to the gutter
so bad it bites reality
echoing sounds of your lover
you tie down your breath for a while
may take some time, sometime
find a dime and i shiver
who cares where you carry your name
tied down by your lover
break my heart and leave you maim
that's you, that's you, that's you
 try on 
you cannot make time go backwards
or make it run fast forward
it will go on without you
clear is my mind echoing throughout within you
lay my heart down easy in your hands
found our hearts are made to shiver
so right would you play me again
shared by one another
the tears in our veins
make your pause
and i'll deliver my gold, i've sold my gold
making my heart work harder
so it can beat much faster
it will go on within me
after my time of passing through
within you
you cannot make time go backwards
or make it run fast forward
it will go on without you
clear is my mind echoing throughout within you


just one fight and just one anniversary
so i never thought you'd be the one to up and leave
you said our love was written in the stars
but i never paid attention to my charts
but now i see how quick you must want to forget
'cause you left the ring i bought you with your cigarettes
well, i can finish up if you don't want them
and i can take the ring back where i got it from

i can love it or i can leave it
you said, "honey, i best be leaving
'cause you're a novice, and i'm a taurus"
and i'm not gonna say, i'm not gonna do
i can love it or i can leave it
you said, "honey, i best be leaving"
'cause you're a taurus and i'm aquarius
and i'm not gonna say, i'm not gonna do

never thought about it sentimentally
never saw just how much you thought i meant to me
never learned about it at university
never thought about it 'cause you're the first, you see
and i'm aware of the procedure
but normally it's me that leaves her
i guess i'm finished up, it's time to move on
i'm taking the ring back to where i got it from

i can love it or i can leave it
you said, "honey, i best be leaving
'cause you're a novice and i'm a taurus
and i'm not gonna say, i'm not gonna do"
i can love it or i can leave it
you said, "honey, i best be leaving
'cause you're a novice and i'm a taurus
and we've had problems, we're notorious for them"
it's what your friends said now, you're inside there now
i've seen our stars and there's nothing aligning
that's 'cause i'm aquarius, yeah, i'm aquarius

i'm aquarius, i'm aquarius
i'm aquarius, i'm aquarius
i'm aquarius, i'm aquarius
i'm aquarius, i'm aquarius
i'm aquarius, i'm aquarius
i'm aquarius, i'm aquarius
i'm aquarius, i'm aquarius
i'm aquarius, i'm aquarius

i can't get no sleep
i can't get no sleep
i need to sleep, i can't get no sleep
 i need to sleep 
deep in the bosom of the gentle night
is when i search for the light, pick up my pen and start to write
i struggle and fight dark forces in the clear moonlight
without fear.. insomnia..
i can't get no sleep
i can't get no sleep
i used to worry, thought i was going mad in a hurry
gettin' stressed makin' excess mess in darkness
no electricity, something's all over me
greasy insomnia, please release me and let me dream of
makin' mad love to my girl on the heath
tearin' off tights with my teeth
but there's no release, no peace, i toss and turn without cease
like a curse, open my eyes, rise like yeast
at least a couple of weeks since i last slept, kept takin' sleepers..
but now i keep myself pepped
deeper still, the night, i write by candle light i find insight
from the mental movement
so when it's black, this insomniac takes an original tack
keep the beast in my nature under ceaseless attack.. i gets no sleep..
i can't get no sleep
i can't get no sleep
i can't get no sleep
i need to sleep, i can't get no sleep..
i need to sleep, i can't get no sleep...


taking it slow, saving up, she
before she knows it, all i ask before she goes home
she's tired of crying and sick of his lies
she's suffered him for far too many years of her life
feeling low and scared that he'll say
do you know how, over time, you drove her away?
saving up for the day when she goes
the day that she stands up for everything that she chose

she can say, she can say

saving up for the day when she goes
the day that she stands up for everything that she chose
taking the kids and driving away
turn around the life she let him siphon away
and i've been with you for all of these years
tell you what i've got to show for all of my tears
the times you hurt me and treated me wrong
something had to give to stop this thing from going on

she can say, she can say

she can say, she can say
who knows what she's gonna say?

ooo heh hey
oh
what we re living in
let me tell ya
it's a wonder man can eat at all
when things are big that should be small
who can tell
what magic spells
we ll be doing for us
and i m giving all my love to this world
only to be told
i can t see
i can t breathe
no more will we be
and nothing s going to change the way we live
 cause we can always take but never give
and now that things are changing for the worse, see
whoa
it s a crazy world we re living in
and i just can t see that half of us immersed in sin is all we have to give these
futures
made of
virtual insanity, now always
seem to
be governed by this love we have for, useless
twisting
of our new technology, oh now there is no sound
for we all live underground
and i m thinking what a mess we re in
hard to know where to begin
if i could slip
the sickly ties that earthly man has made
and now every mother
can choose the colour
of her child
that s not nature s way
well that s what they said yesterday
there s nothing left to do but pray
i think it s time to find a new religion
whoa, it s so insane
to synthesize another strain
there s something in these futures that we have to be told
futures
made of
virtual insanity, now always
seem to
be governed by this love we have for useless
twisting
of our new technology, oh now there is no sound
for we all live underground, whoa
now there is no sound
if we all live underground
and now it's virtual insanity
forget your virtual reality
oh
there's nothing so bad
as a man made man
oh, yeah
i know yeah
i know i can't go on
ooh
of this virtual insanity we're living in
has got to change
yeah
things
will never be the same
and i can't go on
where we're living in
oh
oh, virtual insanity
oh, this world
has got to change
'cause i just
i just can't keep going on in this virtual
virtual insanity
that we're living in
where we're living in
and that virtual insanity is what it is
yeah
ooh
futures
made of
virtual insanity, now always
seem to
be governed by this love we have for useless
twisting
of our new technology, oh now there is no sound
for we all live underground, oh
futures
made of
now virtual insanity
now we all, we seem to be governed
by a love for this useless twisting
of our new technology
and now there is no sound
for we all live underground
yes we do
oh
now this life that we live in
it's all going wrong
out of the window
do you know
that
there is nothing worse than
a man made man
i feel there's nothing worse than
a foolish man
hey
virtual insanity is what we're living in
yeah
it is alright?


i was a liar
i'll never be holy in your eyes
but you'll never be either
'cause i know that underneath your smile
hides the nights that you regret and the days you can't forget
'cause you know me
and we'll never be holy

i've been keeping to myself
and looking back over my shoulder
trying to live my life just like somebody else
and forget all the empty words i told ya

i'm a mess, these demons follow me home
it's easy to bury the guilt on my own
now my fears will finally swallow me whole
'cause i wasn't honest
and i never wanted to admit that

i was a liar
i'll never be holy in your eyes
but you'll never be either
'cause i know that underneath your smile
hides the nights that you regret and the days you can't forget
'cause you know me
and we'll never be holy

it's a sickness i can't seem to shake
'til i wake up alone and ashamed
or a tie that i'm too scared to break
in case i'm drunk and i need you again
i was never the one
i was always just easy
you would lend me enough to follow through
maybe when you're alone
and you look in the mirror
well, you can feel as low as i do

just a mess, these demons follow you home
it's easy to bury the guilt on your own
now your fears will finally swallow you whole
but i wasn't honest
and you never wanted to admit that

i was a liar
i'll never be holy in your eyes
but you'll never be either
'cause i know that underneath your smile
hides the nights that you regret and the days you can't forget
'cause you know me
and we'll never be holy
and we'll never be holy  holy in your eyes 
no, we'll never be holy  holy in your eyes 
'cause the nights that you regret and the days you can't forget
leave you lonely
and we'll never be holy

i'll always be a mess if i keep living this way
despite all my flaws, i still hope you're okay
i don't know if i can honestly say
that it's getting better
but at least together
we were holy


it must be an infestation
something that i can't control

but i'll give it to you anyhow, anyhow, anyhow

i'm full of good intentions
like i never was before
it's too late for prevention
but i don't think it's too late for cure
so you call in your minions
see what you can't find
night time or morning
these hands are sticky but i don't mind
why must you always be around?
why can't you just leave it be?
it's done nothing so far but destroy my life
you cause as much sorrow dead
as you did when you were alive
i never said i was tough
that was everyone else
so you're a fool to attack me
for the image that you built yourself
it just sounds more vicious
then i actually mean
i really am soft
yes, i'm tender + sweet
why must you always be around?
why can't you just leave it be?
you've done nothing so far but destroy my life
you cause as much sorrow dead
as you did when you were alive
why must you always ask me?
why can't you just leave it be?
you've done nothing so far but destroy my life
you cause as much sorrow dead
as you did when you were alive

when you were young and on your own
how did it feel to be alone
i was always thinking of games that i was playing
trying to make the best of my time
but only love can break your heart
try to be sure right from the start
yes, only love can break your heart
but if your world should fall apart
i have a friend i've never seen
he hides his head inside a dream
someone should call him and see if he can come out
try to lose the down that he's found
but only love can break your heart
try to be sure right from the start
yes, only love can break your heart
but if your world should fall apart
i was always thinking... i was always thinking...

the only one i know
is mine when she stitches me
the only one i see
has found an aching in me
the only one i see
has turned her tongue into me
everyone has been burned before
everybody knows the pain
everyone has been burned before
everybody knows the pain
the only one i know
never cries, never opens her eyes
the only one i know
wide awake and then she's away
the only one i see
is mine when she walks down our street
the only one i see
has carved her way into me
everyone has been burned before
everybody knows the pain

all in all there's something to do
all in all there's something to live
with you
all i need is a little sign
to get behind this sun and cast this weight of mine
all i need is the place to find
and there i'll celebrate
all in all there's something to give
all in all there's something to do
all in all there's something to live
with you


to see age in a flower
the dawns are speeding up
you know it ll hurt you
feel all of a sudden
tired and teary eyed
you knew it d kill you

don t wear a tie that ll choke you
to death in the city
take it off and forget
spare the fret that ll make you
miss all of summer
sweat it out and forgive

to see loss in a shower
the petals turn to mush
it still disappoints you
then less of a sudden
you wire your weary mind

this town's the oldest friend of mine

i see it everywhere, in every face and every place that i go
i see it in the eyes of all the strangers and the people i know
even in the buildings and the statues on the streets that i walk
even in the voices even though they never say when they talk
you're in love with life
you're in love with life
it is the greatest thing i've ever seen
it is the truth and the light
i watch you in the morning as the sunlight rolls in with the new dawn
i saw you in the evening smiling like it was the day you were born
but even after all you hold your head up, lift your voice and we say
acknowledge all the wonder, and the magic, that the journey might bring
you're in love with life
you're in love with life
it is the greatest thing i've ever seen
it is the truth and the light
you're in love with life

too many lying, too many crying
 there's  too many voices, so little choices
at night i lie awake, feels like heartache
feels like heartache, how long will the night take
how long will the night take, it feels like heartache
the night has come, they say i rise crime rate
 can't wait
i rise my fist the thunder break through
make a wish who will you run to
 there's  too many prisons taking away from family
too many reasons to lose your sanity
i lie awake and let the visions take me
think of life and how it tried to break me
had no choice, had to settle
hear a voice now they burn from metal
there's too many shouts and they call it treason
can't relate and hate without reason
 there's  too many guns, pray for god to come quick
he doesn't come, my god is real sick

it's in your eyes, a colour fade out
looks like a new transition
is starting up and shaking your ground
turning your head to see a new day calling
does it feel like a head to lean on
a snapshot from where you were born?
i'm looking for your hand in the rough
you're caught in the wire
well, i'll lift you out
leaning on the action
caught in a cellphone's rays
bleeding on the sofa
staring at the wayside
he's coming and she knows it
even if she knows why
footsteps in the hallway
girl, you haven't got time

you gotta get out
go far away
you gotta get out
go far away
darkness in the bedroom
maybe she's resting up
maybe she was out late
just come back from the club
i can't hear her breathing
something doesn't seem right
killer in the hallway
we're living on a set time

we gotta get out
go far away

go far away


sit down 
just shut up  i'll talk
no, you just sit down
i'll talk 

can i come back next time dressed in shite
and take my place on the landscapes ice
it's the rest who push the policy dream
affixing life with policy cream
voice your thoughts near big black gates
on bed of rose near bricks and gates
to the sound of nothing as it breaks the spell
there's no witchcraft here, it's just fucking hell

we're in the makings of another role
where we all get the chance to climb on again
it's just the makings of another role
that will turn on us all eventually

yeah, i got a roadworks pose even though i'm free
i mean i can't really moan because you'll have a go at me
so stupid ain't we? we're like pumped up meat
wet and fried and thick to the slice
i got no flies on me, i'm like shit that's white
the kind that you tell your kids to pick up if they like
i got two brown bins, should i only have one?
but what the council don't know won't hurt them

we're in the makings of another role
where we all get the chance to climb on again
it's just the makings of another role
that will turn on us all eventually
we're in the makings of another role
where we all get the chance to climb on again

flocking to the sea
crowds of people wait for me
sea gulls scavenge
steal ice cream
worries vanish
within my dream
i left my soul there
down by the sea
i lost control here
living free
i left my soul there
down by the sea
i lost control here
living free
fishing boats sail past the shore
no singing may day any more
the sun is shining
the water's clear
just you and i walk along the pier
i left my soul there
down by the sea
i lost control here
living free
i left my soul there
down by the sea
i lost control here
living free
a cool breeze flows but mind the wasp
some get stung it's worth the cost
i'd love to stay
the city calls me home
more hassles fuss and lies on the phone
i left my soul there
down by the sea
i lost control here
living free
i left my soul there
down by the sea
i lost control here
living free
i left my soul there
down by the sea
i lost control here
living free
i left my soul there
down by the sea
living, living
and i, living, by the sea


take me down six underground
the ground beneath your feet
laid out low, nothing to go
nowhere a way to meet

i've got a head full of drought down here
so far off losing out round here
overground, watch this space
i'm open to falling from grace

calm me down, bring it 'round
too way high off your street
i can see like nothing else
in me you're better than i wanna be

don't think 'cause i understand i care
don't think 'cause i'm talking we're friends
overground, watch this space
i'm open to falling from grace

talk me down, safe and sound
too strung up to sleep
wear me out, scream and shout
swear my time's never cheap

i fake my life like i've lived too much
i take whatever you're given, not enough
overground, watch this space
i'm open
i fake my life like i've lived too much
i take whatever you're given, not enough
overground, watch this space
i'm open to falling from grace


buy it, use it, break it, fix it

i think it's time you take another look around if you're gonna bring a knife into a gunfight bragging how you're sick of hearing every single human being seeing as they're watching but can't see past what they're seeing
you can keep em at bat but put that knife away
always with the wild card you're gonna wanna play cuz you're my implosionatic
my implosion addict
that a boy
don't rock the boat
that a boy
let it implode
i think it's time you take another couple days off
gotta make a conversation such a face off
i'm betting debt is threatening to make it worse
try to hide you're dreaming up an epitaphic verse
you can keep em at bay but put your pills away
always with the wild card you always wanna play
so much for dying before you're 30 or 27 like jan and jim
get on it
where's your iconic all too ironic romantic tragedy recorded quadraphonic?


so sweet, so beautiful
everyday like a queen on her throne
don't nobody knows how she feels
aicha, lady one day it will be real  let's do it 
she moves, she moves like a breeze
i swear i can't get her out of my dreams
to have her shining right here by my side  shining like a star 
i'd sacrifice all them tears in my eyes

aicha, aicha   passing me by  there she goes again 
aicha, aicha   my, my, my  is it really real 
aicha, aicha   smile for me now  i don't know, i don't know 
aicha, aicha   in my life

she holds her child to her heart
makes her feel like she is blessed from above
falls asleep underneath her sweet tears
her lullaby fades away with his fears

aicha, aicha   passing me by  there she goes again 
aicha, aicha   my, my, my

she needs somebody to lean on
someone body, mind   soul
to take her hand, to take her world
and show her the time of her life, so true
throw the pain away for good
no more contemplating boo
no more contemplating boo

lord knows the way she feels
everyday in his name she begins
to have her shining here by my side
i'd sacrifice all them tears in my eyes

aicha, aicha    coute moi  let's do this 
aicha, aicha   passing me by  there she goes again 
aicha, aicha   my, my, my  is it really real 
aicha, aicha   smile for me now
aicha, aicha   in my life
aicha, aicha    there she goes again 
aicha, aicha   passing me by
aicha, aicha   she don't know she the love of my life, no she don't
aicha, aicha   no she don't


derulo

i got the sheets on the floor, nothing on me
and i can't take it no more, it's a hundred degrees
i got one foot out the door, where are my keys? 'cause i gotta leave, yeah
in the back of the cab  ooh 
i tipped the driver 'head of time, get me there fast  ooh 
i got your body on my mind, i want it bad  ooh 
oh, just the thought of you gets me so high, so high

girl, you're the one i want to want me
and if you want me, girl, you got me
there's nothing i, no, i wouldn't do  i wouldn't do 
just to get up next to you
girl, you're the one i want to want me
and if you want me, girl, you got me
there's nothing i, no, i wouldn't do  i wouldn't do 
just to get up next to you
ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
just to get up next to you
ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
aw yeah

you open the door  ooh 
wearing nothing but a smile down to the floor  ooh 
and you whisper in my ear, "baby, i'm yours"  ooh 
ooh, just the thought of you gets me so high, so high

girl, you're the one i want to want me
and if you want me, girl, you got me
there's nothing i, no, i wouldn't do  i wouldn't do 
just to get up next to you
girl, you're the one i want to want me

oh yeah i used to know quinnan
he's a real, he's a real jerk


now did you see me, i killed a man
they all stayed down, but he chose to stand
and girl, when did it hit you deep
to watch his mind seep
across the pavement, beat down, slaps the meat
each and every single one of your feet
that you will ever know
the limitations of a clone
they kept me on my throne
the silk space of time
covered in a trace of slime
it's not here to appear for the tears
the mere hatred that flows through the years
the silent calm, washed violent charm
held in the depths of a tyrant's palm
expect the ides, to lay by his side
and bear with the sight of just another man's mind

i must mistake the high
cool these breaks, these stakes will lie
i was not born to be taught
i was born to be exposed in the storm
and held awhile
in the hot heat in the mother
sat by the feet of your lover
feet down, decede one another
i dug through these graves to uncover
a pile of bones mixed with violent tones
forced through the earth with these silent drones
i'll seek through time, evading the mimes
i'll breathe in time and of the guide's sign

you trust these snakes to die?
with all the ways you trace the climb
go up the ladder, made from the latter
made even sadder, but he born to an adder
i'm on the depth of a bridge
you took your time to plant a seed
a seed of hate, the plagues you played
so bear witness to the strength and states
you want to be the body of song
are you strong across this glum
pinnacle of crumbs
see these hands and see what they crave to be done
you are, you are this useless art that's gone too far
you are, you are
you are a body of song
you pave me down to the dirt and scum
look what i've become
see these hands, these actions that i've done
walk bear beaten down
black blue brains out
this drain will be clogged
let their brains be drowned
walk bear beaten down
these black beat brains out
these drains be clogged
these brains be drowned

feet down, decede one another
i dug through these graves uncover
these graves uncover
a pile of bones mixed with violent tones
forced through the earth with these silent drones
a pile of bones



you arrive in the rising sun
the hidden passenger that i've been taking
close your eyes, let's forget again
as you drag me down, i will take you in

what are you waiting for?
just surrender here tonight
what are you waiting for
as we go towards the light?

when everything is said and done
still looking for answers, if only one
turn my back, the urge has gone
left with no reason, we come undone

i am caught in your slow release
seems like your traveler is eager to move me
my reflection will slowly fade
to another time until my head escapes

what are you waiting for?
just surrender here tonight
what are you waiting for
as we go towards the light?

when everything is said and done
still looking for answers, if only one
turn my back, the urge has gone
left with no reason, we come undone

feeling in love but i just can't stay
searching magic every day
cross the ocean through the haze
take me back ocean blue bring me home
memories and mysteries point to you
take me back ocean blue bring me home
memories and mysteries point to you
pull my body to the shore
but i donl live here anymore
see you turn and speak to me
but i just hear whispers of the sea
take me back ocean blue bring me home
memories and mysteries point to you
take me back ocean blue bring me home
memories and mysteries point to you
dreaming i am going home
deadlights, sweet surprise
see the mourning in her eyes
don't look back, just cut me loose
keep on searching, find the truth
take my hand tonight and see the passage shining bright
eclipsing everything we know

tell me a line make it easy for me
open your arms
dance with me until i feel all right
it's good in the dark, good in the dark
but into the lover's light
here comes another fight
so ring the alarm, ring the alarm
bore me and hold me and cling to my arm
here it comes, here it comes
and what you're asking me now, disastrous now
hoping and hoping and hoping
the feeling goes away

never change, never change, never change, never change
never change, never change, never change
this is why i fell in love
never change, never change, never change, never change
never change, never change, never change
that's just who i fell in love with
 in love... 

this is the time the very best time
so give me a line and take me home
take me over
but dashing the hopes dashing the hopes
and smashing the pride
the morning's got you on the ropes
and love is a murderer, love is a murderer
but if she calls you tonight
everything is all right
yeah, we know
and love is a curse shoved in a hearse
love is an open book to a verse of your bad poetry
and this is coming from me

but i can change, i can change, i can change, i can change
i can change, i can change, i can change
if it helps you fall in love
 fall in love 

turn on the light, make it easy for me
feel the divide, fumble in the kitchen
'til it's right
what an awful sight
but there's love in your eyes
love in your eyes, love in your eyes
but maybe that's just your love of fights
all night 

but i can change, i can change, i can change, i can change
i can change, i can change, i can change
if it helps you fall in love
 in love 

and i can change, i can change, i can change, i can change
i can change, i can change, i can change
if it helps you feel real love
 in love 

and i can change, i can change, i can change, i can change
i can change, i can change, i can change
if it helps you feel real love
 in love

new york, i love you but you're bringing me down
new york, i love you but you're bringing me down
like a rat in a cage
pulling minimum wage
new york, i love you but you're bringing me down
new york, you're safer and you're wasting my time
our records all show you were filthy but fine
but they shuttered your stores
when you opened the doors
to the cops who were bored once they'd run out of crime
new york, you're perfect, oh, please don't change a thing
your mild billionaire mayor's now convinced he's a king
so the boring collect
i mean all disrespect
in the neighborhood bars i'd once dreamt i would drink
new york, i love you but you're freaking me out
there's a ton of the twist but we're fresh out of shout
like a death in the hall
that you hear through your wall
new york, i love you but you're freaking me out
new york, i love you but you're bringing me down
new york, i love you but you're bringing me down
like a death of the heart
jesus, where do i start?
but you're still the one pool where i'd happily drown
and oh  take me off your mailing list
for kids who think it still exists
yes, for those who think it still exists
maybe i'm wrong and maybe you're right
maybe i'm wrong and maybe you're right
maybe you're right, maybe i'm wrong
and just maybe you're right
and oh  maybe mother told you true
and there'll always be somebody there for you
and you'll never be alone
but maybe she's wrong and maybe i'm right
and just maybe she's wrong
maybe she's wrong and maybe i'm right
and if so, here's this song 

i can't get no sleep
i can't get no sleep
i need to sleep, i can't get no sleep
 i need to sleep 
deep in the bosom of the gentle night
is when i search for the light, pick up my pen and start to write
i struggle and fight dark forces in the clear moonlight
without fear.. insomnia..
i can't get no sleep
i can't get no sleep
i used to worry, thought i was going mad in a hurry
gettin' stressed makin' excess mess in darkness
no electricity, something's all over me
greasy insomnia, please release me and let me dream of
makin' mad love to my girl on the heath
tearin' off tights with my teeth
but there's no release, no peace, i toss and turn without cease
like a curse, open my eyes, rise like yeast
at least a couple of weeks since i last slept, kept takin' sleepers..
but now i keep myself pepped
deeper still, the night, i write by candle light i find insight
from the mental movement
so when it's black, this insomniac takes an original tack
keep the beast in my nature under ceaseless attack.. i gets no sleep..
i can't get no sleep
i can't get no sleep
i can't get no sleep
i need to sleep, i can't get no sleep..
i need to sleep, i can't get no sleep...

 ich  tr umte so gerne von den freuden der welt
ich hatte manches sch ne mir vorgestellt
und dann kam ein tag und den vergesse ich nie
viel sch ner als meine phantasie
ooh, ooh, k sse s ßer als wein
i dreamed so happily about the joys of the world
i had met a beautiful one
and then came one day that i'll never forget
much more beautiful than my fantasy
ooh, ooh, kisses sweeter than wine


beetles and eggs and blues and poor little everything else
you steam a lens stable eyes and glass
not get pissed off through my burned lips as good news

still being cried and
laughed at from behind
"don't fall behind, miss"
from first my turn's rules

beetles and eggs and blues and bells and eggs and blues
beetles and eggs and blues and poor little everything else
you steam a lens stable eyes and glass
not get pissed off through my burned lips as good news

you'll hang the hearts black and dull as the night
we hanged your pass and start being as you in ecstasy
 still being cried and laughed at before 
should i be sewn in hugged i can by not saying
 still being cried and laughed at from light to blue 

and should i be hugged and tugged down through
this tiger's masque?
and should i be sung and unbroken by not saying
your mind not saying

you'll hang that heart's black and dull as the night
 still being cried and laughed at from behind me, from blues 
we hanged your pass and star being as you in ecstasy
 still being cried and laughed at from behind me, from blues 
should i be sung and unbroken by not saying
 still being cried and laughed at from behind me, from blues 
hugged and tugged down through this tiger's masque for kicks


no new year's day to celebrate
no chocolate covered candy hearts to give away
no first of spring, no song to sing
in fact here's just another ordinary day

no april rain, no flowers bloom
no wedding saturday within the month of june
but what it is is something new
made up of these three words i say to you

i just called to say i love you
i just called to say how much i care
i just called to say i love you
and i mean it from the bottom of my heart

no summer's high
no warm july
no harvest moon to light one tender august night
no autumn breeze
no falling leaves
not even time for birds to fly to southern skies
no libra sun
no halloween
no giving thanks to all the christmas joy you bring
but what it is, though old so new
to fill your heart like no three words could ever do

i just called to say i love you
i just called to say how much i care
i just called to say i love you
and i mean it from the bottom of my heart

i just called to say i love you
i just called to say how much i care
i just called to say i love you
and i mean it from the bottom of my heart

everybody makes mistakes
but i feel alright when i come undone
you're not not making me wait
but it seems alright as long as something's happening
i try to make you late
but you fight me out like a fire does
you try making me wait
but it feels alright as long as something's happening
get your payments from the nation
for your trials and tribulations
you try to make me wait
you come around when it's come undone
everybody makes you late
and it's never you, because you're always thinkin'
i try making you wait
and you give me some like you give it good
everybody makes mistakes
but it seems it's mine that always keep on stingin'
get your payments from the nation
for your trial and tribulations
get your payments from the nation
for your trial and tribulations
you try making me wait
but you come undone when you come undone
everybody makes mistakes
but it's always mine that seem to keep on stickin'
get your payments from the nation, for your trials and tribulations
get your payments from the nation, for your trials and tribulations
get your payments from the nation, for your trials and tribulations
get your payments from the nation, for your trials and tribulations
get your payments from the nation, for your trials and tribulations


light reflects from your shadow
it is more than i thought could exist
you move through the room
like breathing was easy
if someone believed me

they would be
as in love with you as i am
they would be
as in love with you as i am
they would be
as in love with you as i am
they would be
in love, love, love

and everyday
i am learning about you
the things that no one else sees
and the end comes too soon
like dreaming of angels
and leaving without them
and leaving without them

being
as in love with you as i am
being
as in love with you as i am
being
as in love with you as i am
being
as in love, love, love
love, love, love
love, love, love

and with words unspoken
a silent devotion
i know you know what i mean
and the end is unknown
but i think i'm ready
as long as you're with me

being
as in love with you as i am
being
as in love with you as i am
being
as in love with you as i am
being
as in love, love, love

home, home in the late night
and away, away in the half light
except saturdays, crushed by the boring
and played and plagued by the touring again
when once you had believed it
now you see it's sucking you in
to string you along with the pretense
and pave the way for the coming release
alone and prone in the half light
and late, late to your real life
if you find a way into the gold rush
you will stay until the morning comes
you can normalize
don't it make you feel alive?
you can normalize
don't it make you feel alive?
you can normalize
don't it make you feel alive?
you can normalize
don't it make you feel alive?
you can normalize
don't it make you feel alive?
you can normalize
don't it make you feel alive?
you can normalize
don't it make you feel alive?
you can normalize
don't it make you feel alive?
get innocuous


it's been a long time waiting
been a long time waiting on you, on you
i've got a lot of love riding
i've got a lot of love riding on you, on you

you tell me i can do what i wanna do
you tell me i can be who i wanna be
you lead me here, don't let me down

i leave you my heart, so take it
showed you my hand, your time to play it
i don't want time to change it
i wanna know what's going on
are you gonna tell me?
 are you gonna? 
are you gonna?
 are you gonna? 

you're the one that i believe in
so don't give me no reason to die, oh no
you're the one that i invest in
every minute of every hour

you tell me i'll be safe standing next to you
you tell me you need me like i need you
you lead me here, don't let me down

i leave you my heart, so take it
showed you my hand, your time to play it
i don't want time to change it
i wanna know what's going on
are you gonna tell me?
 are you gonna? 
are you gonna?
 are you gonna? 

are you gonna tell me what i do to you?
can i sit back? relax?
watch the world go by and know that we got it
tell me what i do to you
can i sit back? relax?
watch the world go by and know that we got it
 are you gonna tell me? 
watch the world go by and know that we got it
are you gonna tell me?
watch the world go by and know that we got it


i'm seeming to be glad a lot
i'm happy again, calmer, calm in time
expose your doubter, arm yourself with
me and then ensure your rise

you're the match of jericho
that will burn this whole madhouse down
and i'll throw open like the walnut safe
more like a love that's a bottle of exquisite stuff is

you, yourself, and your father
don't know, so much in your own ways
you're really both bone setters
thank you for mending me babies

you're the match of jericho
that will burn this whole madhouse down
and i'll throw open like a walnut safe
you would seem more like being from that same bottle of exquisite stuff
is, you are the match of jericho that will
burn this whole madhouse down on the floor
open like the walnut safe

you, yourself, and your father don't know
so much in your own ways
you're really both bone setters
thank you for mending me babies

tell me where you've been to
nowhere that you shouldn't do
tell me what you're good for
i can tell you something too
where have you been staying?
tell me what you're playing
hope it's not my conscience
but it keeps complaining
didn't meet you in an alley
the cats they weren't complaining
i met you in the daylight
our visions misbehaving
i offer you my temper
with the hope that you would tame me
we built ourselves a shelter
you will always be my baby
feeling, keep on feeling, keep on feeling

i only wanna be your one life stand  keep on feeling 
tell me do you stand by your man?  keep on feeling 
i only wanna be your one life stand  keep on feeling 
tell me do you stand by your man?  keep on feeling 
wishes keep remaining
nothing worth containing
a balloon with air is escaping
is nothing but a plaything
moments keep us guessing
and lead us from temptation
but better to embrace them
and measure our relation

i only wanna be your one life stand  keep on feeling 
tell me do you stand by your man?  keep on feeling 
i only wanna be your one life stand  keep on feeling 
tell me do you stand by your man?  keep on feeling 

 could this be, could this be? 
i only wanna be your one life stand  keep on feeling 
 could this be, could this be? 
tell me do you stand by your man?  keep on feeling 
 could this be, could this be? 
i only wanna be your one life stand  keep on feeling 
 could this be, could this be? 
tell me do you stand by your man?  keep on feeling 



what's going on? could this be my understanding?
it's not your fault i was being too demanding
i must admit, it's my pride that made me distant
all because i hoped that you'd be someone different

there's not much i know about you
fear will always make you blind
but the answer is in clear view
it's amazing what you'll find face to face

i turned away because i thought you were the problem
tried to forget, until i hit the bottom
but when i faced you in my blank confusion
i realised you weren't wrong, it was a mere illusion

it really didn't make sense
just to leave this unresolved
it's not hard to go the distance
when you finally get involved face to face

it really didn't make sense

when i think that i'm over you
i'm overpowered

your data my data
the chromosomes match
exact as in matter
a matter of fact
these amaranth feelings
a cognitive state
need the love object
to reciprocate

when i think that i'm over you
i'm overpowered
it's long overdue
i'm overpowered

i'm overpowered

oxy toxin's flowing ever into my brain

alien feelings
we have to accept

do you feel like a chainstore?
practically floored
one of many zeros
kicked around, bored
your ears are full but you're empty
holding out your heart
to people who never really
care how you are

so give me coffee and tv, easily
i've seen so much, i'm going blind
and i'm braindead virtually
sociability, it's hard enough for me
take me away from this big, bad world
and agree to marry me
so we can start over again

do you go to the country?
it isn't very far
there's people there who will hurt you
because of who you are
your ears are full of the language
there's wisdom there, you're sure
until the words start slurring
and you can't find the door

so give me coffee and tv, easily
i've seen so much, i'm going blind
and i'm braindead virtually

cause i might just save you
baby don't come back
cause i might just save you
the days of men are coming to an end
so come with me, if you wanna live
you come from a time where they look the same
and think the same too
there's nowhere left to go, so i might just save you
they all want to be saved
my hands been bloody since the day i came
it's such a shame, you've seen my violent side
so baby don't come back
cause i might just kill you


to see age in a flower
the dawns are speeding up
you know it ll hurt you
feel all of a sudden
tired and teary eyed
you knew it d kill you

don t wear a tie that ll choke you
to death in the city
take it off and forget
spare the fret that ll make you
miss all of summer
sweat it out and forgive

to see loss in a shower
the petals turn to mush
it still disappoints you
then less of a sudden
you wire your weary mind
to let it deceive you

don t force a smile that ll make you
resent the city
play it soft and forgive
keep the frown that ll make you
squint in the summer
play it slow and forget


your needs are covered by me
know that i see you weep
our blood runs deep
your mind could change the game
i won't let you go insane
with severed veins

if you only knew
we won't undo
it's always you
and now you know it's true
me said there's never undo
it's always you

you've been a dark story
but don't let it sink right in
let's just sing
if you got desire to see
a clear idea
we could be the sun down here
we could bring the fun around here

if you only knew
we won't undo
it's always you
and now you know it's true
me said there's never undo
it's always you

if you're tortured in pain
i could be the one
i could stop the rain from falling
no need to be afraid
let me be the one
you and i are the same

and if you only knew
we won't undo
it's always you
and now you know it's true
me said there's never undo
it's always you

i remember what it's like
to be a victim almost every night
and no one knows, or really cares
what your drinking, or the clothes we wear
hello, hello

hello, hello
to the ivy nations
hello, hello
to all the generation
yeah

when i'm falling down
will you pick me up again?
when i'm too far gone
dead in the eyes of my friends
will you take me out of here
when i'm staring down the barrel
when i'm blinded by the lights
when i cannot see your face?
take me out of here
take me out of here
take me out of here
take me out of here

all i believe and all i've known
are being taken from me, can't get home
led to a world where worlds collide
let the fear collapse, bring no surprise
take me out of here

feed the fire, break your vision
throw your fists up, come on with me
feed the fire, break your vision
throw your fists up, come on with me
feed the fire, break your vision
throw your fists up, come on with me
feed the fire, break your vision
throw your fists up, come on with me

let your fear subside
just stay where you are
if there's nothing to hide

i remember flashbacks lighting up magic whip
eight o'clock, kowloon emptiness, handle it
the white horse image i had of you eleven seconds ago
i didn't send you, so you will never know
i got away for a little while
but then it came back much harder

swinging on a cable up to po lin
climbing panda, ghostly wine, and a battery
that light in your eyes i search for religiously
when it's not there, oh lord, it's hurting me
i got away for a little while
but then it came back much harder

'til i ever hold you out there again, will you be mine?
'cause i'm on a ghost ship drowning my heart in hong kong
it's the last ride boarding here tonight
out in the bay  out in the bay 
i'll need a lantern in you to shine out bright rays

feeling out of body here, what can i do?
it's up to the top every day to join with you
i had to get away for a little while
but then it came back much harder

'til i ever hold you out there again, will you be mine?
'cause i'm on a ghost ship drowning my heart in hong kong
it's the last ride boarding here tonight
out in the bay  out in the bay 
i'll need a lantern in you to shine out bright rays

bright rays, bright rays

the only one i know
has come to take me away
the only one i know
is mine when she stitches me
the only one i see
has found an aching in me
the only one i see
has turned her tongue into me
everyone has been burned before
everybody knows the pain
everyone has been burned before
everybody knows the pain
the only one i know
never cries, never opens her eyes
the only one i know
wide awake and then she's away
the only one i see
is mine when she walks down our street
the only one i see
has carved her way into me
everyone has been burned before
everybody knows the pain
everyone has been burned before
everybody knows the pain
everyone has been burned before
everybody knows the pain
everyone has been burned before
everybody knows the pain


you'll be given love
you'll be taken care of
you'll be given love
you have to trust it

maybe not from the sources
you have poured yours
maybe not from the directions
you are staring at

twist your head around
it's all around you
all is full of love
all around you

all is full of love
you just ain't receiving
all is full of love
your phone is off the hook
all is full of love
your doors are all shut
all is full of love

all is full of love, all is full of love
all is full of love, all is full of love
all is full of love
all is full of love, all is full of love
all is full of love
all is full of love
all is full of love
all is full of love

too many lights out, but nowhere near here
it was me on that road
still you couldn't see me
and the flashlights and explosions
road's end getting nearer
we cover distance but not together
i am the storm, and i am the wonder
and the flashlights, nightmares, sudden explosions
i don't know what more to ask for
i was given just one wish
it's about you and the sun
a morning run
the story of my maker
what i have and what i ache for
i've got a golden ear
i cut and i spear
and what else is there?
road's end getting nearer
we cover distance still not together

will i have flashlights, nightmares, sudden explosions?

if you think i'm losing you, you must be crazy
all your money on me
i'm never gonna let you go, even when it's easy
put your money on me
or tuck me into bed, and wake me when i'm dead
i know that you gotta be free
but i'm never gonna let it go

if there was a race, a race for your heart
it started before you were born
above the chloroform sky
clouds made of ambien
sitting on carpets in the basement of heaven
we were born innocent, but it lasts a day
and baby you can give all the money away
but if there's a race, a race for your heart
it's over before it starts
singing

put your money on me
if you think i'm losing you, you must be crazy
all your money on me
i'm never gonna let you go, even when it's easy
put your money on me
or tuck me into bed, and wake me when i'm dead
i know that you gotta be free
but i'm never gonna let it go

all my presents are broken before they're open
and the promises, the second they're spoken
i know i've been different
my skin keeps shedding
my mother was crying on the day of our wedding
trumpets of angels call for my head
i fight through the ether and i'll quit when i'm dead
if you want to know who'll be there in the end
when you bury me, baby, i'll still be your friend
singing

put your money on me
if you think i'm losing you, you must be crazy
all your money on me
i'm never gonna let you go, even when it's easy
put your money on me
or tuck me into bed, and wake me when i'm dead
i know that you gotta be free
but i'm never gonna let it go

i know it's not the last time
put your money on
all your money on
put your money on
i know it's not easy

 to put your money on me 
 'cause i can barely breathe 
 when you put your money on me 
when silicon valley's melted back into silicon
we'll find a way to survive
singing

put your money on me
if you think i'm losing you, you must be crazy
all your money on me
i'm never gonna let you go, even when it's easy
put your money on me

well i heard it, playing soft
from a drunken bar's jukebox
and for a moment i was lost
in remembering, what i never forgot
and i never felt guilt about
the trouble that we got into
i just couldn't let that honey hide inside of you
and just because now it's different
doesn't change what it meant
and when i hear that song
you know i'm only gonna
think about one girl
i think about you
when i sing this song
you know i'm only gonna
sing it for one girl
ooh ooh ooh
well i heard it, playing loud
i never knew what it was about
till i fell silent in a crowd
i just turned around and walked straight out
'cause i guess i felt guilty
about the trouble that i caused you
putting myself first, just like i always do
but that doesn't change how i feel
'cause when i hear it, it feels real
and when i hear that song
you know i'm only gonna
think about one boy
i think about you
and when i sing this song
you know i'm only gonna
sing it for one boy
ooh ooh ooh
well, i can't forget
things you said or your kisses
and i keep your secrets
where i keep your promises
but you need my confessions
about as much as you need my lies
and i guess it took that song to make me realize



we are young, we run green
keep our teeth nice and clean
see our friends, see the sights
and feel alright

we wake up, we go out
smoke a fag, put it out
see our friends, see the sights
and feel alright

are we like you?
i can't be sure
of the scene as she turns
we are strange in our worlds

but we are young, we get by
can't go mad, ain't got time
sleep around if we like
but we're alright

got some cash, bought some wheels
took it out 'cross the fields
lost control, hit a wall
but we're alright

are we like you?
i can't be sure
of the scene as she turns
we are strange in our worlds

but we are young, we run green
keep our teeth nice and clean
see our friends, see the sights
and feel alright

are we like you?
i can't be sure
of the scene as she turns
we are strange in our worlds

but we are young, we run green
keep our teeth nice and clean
see our friends, see the sights

"everybody be cool, this is a robbery "
"any of you fucking pricks move
and i'll execute every motherfucking last one of you "

me and fast got the gats, we're out to rob the bank
we got steve outside carrying a full pack
now everything's cool and everything's smooth
hey that's smooth...
i walked up to the teller, i gave her the letter
she gives me the loot with puckered up lips and a wink
that i found cute and i said, "baby, baby, baby..."
is this some karmic chi love thing happening here baby or what?
by that time fast tapped me with the 9
he said it was time to blow, you know
so out the door we go back to the ride with steve inside
and alive, and off we drive
see, i hurt my lower lumbar, you know we'll never get far
riding around in a stolen police car
so we dropped it off and piled in a caddy
steve was driving because i had to talk to my man about something
"look, i don't know anything about any fucking set up
you can torture me all you want..."
"torture you, that's good, that's a good idea, i like that one."

running around robbing banks
all whacked off of scooby snacks
running around robbing banks
all whacked off of scooby snacks
and i don't give a fuck about the hell's gate
ain't punkin' the crowd and i'm still standing up straight
so, we pull these jobs to make a little money
no one gets hurt if they don't act funny
on the way to the yacht, we almost got caught
fast is shooting mailboxes, not knowing where the cop is, yeah
they're at the dunkin donuts, adjacent from the fromans'
whose mailbox fast had just exploded
they gave chase, but my man steve's an ace
and we lost those brothers with haste
we casted off and along we went
off bermuda to an island resort we rented
"sonny, i need you cool, are you cool?"
"...i am cool."

making sense of what i've heard
and what is on my mind
don't look down cause it's far to fall
count the hours, face the fear
it's haunting me these days
we're past the post and through the door
hail, commercial suicide
kiss the life you left behind
don't let it bother you
you do what it takes to get what you can
last night i thought about
another life and what i'd do
it's hanging over me
i'm sure to break your loving heart
i'm dying to take a walk
down this sugar coated sonic path
cause i've been hanging around for hours
staring at your hologram
outside a northern harbour
digging up the harder times
i might have known that you'd been
tearing up the photographs
standing on your holy ground
lost sight of all i've done
picking round for higher ground
guests out in paradise
with china dolls and better times
the satellite is always overhead
it's watching you
you know it's living hell
i'm solid gone, coming for no one, no one, no one

if you ever get close to a human
and human behavior
be ready, be ready to get confused
there's definitely, definitely, definitely no logic
to human behavior
but yet so, yet so irresistible

and there is no map

they're terribly, terribly, terribly moody
oh, human behavior
then all of a sudden turn happy
but, oh, to get involved in the exchange
of human emotions
is ever so, ever so satisfying

and there is no map

human behavior, human, human
human behavior, human, human

i must've died and gone to heaven
cos it was a quarter past eleven
on a saturday in 1999
right across from where i'm standing
on the dance floor she was landing
it was clear that she was from another time
like some baby barbarella
with the stars as her umbrella
she asked me if i'd like to magnetize
do i have to go star trekking
cause it's you i should be checking
so she laserbeamed me with her cosmic eyes

she's just a cosmic girl
from another galaxy
my heart's at zero gravity
she's from a cosmic world
putting me in ecstasy
transmitting on my frequency
she's cosmic

i'm scanning all my radars
we'll she said she's from a quasar
forty thousand million light years away
it's a distant solar system
i tried to phone but they don't list 'em
so i asked her for a number all the same
she said, step in my transporter
so i can teleport ya
all around my heavenly body
this could be a close encounter
i should take care not to flounder
sends me into hyperspace, when i see her pretty face

she's just a cosmic girl
from another galaxy
my heart's at zero gravity
she's from a cosmic world
putting me in ecstasy
transmitting on my frequency
she's cosmic

sends me into hyperspace when i see her pretty face

sends me into hyperspace when i see her pretty face

i wish that we could talk about it
but there, that's the problem
with someone new i could have started
too late for beginnings
the little things that made me nervous
are gone in a moment
i miss the way we used to argue
locked in your basement

i wake up and the phone is ringing
surprised, as it's early
and that should be a perfect warning
that something's a problem
to tell the truth, i saw it coming
the way you were breathing
but nothing can prepare you for it
the voice on the other end

the worst is all the lovely weather
i'm stunned it's not raining
the coffee isn't even bitter
because what's the difference?
there's all the work that needs to be done
it's late for revision
there's all the time and all the planning
and songs to be finished

and it keeps coming and it keeps coming
and it keeps coming 'til the day it stops
and it keeps coming and it keeps coming
and it keeps coming 'til the day it stops
and it keeps coming and it keeps coming
and it keeps coming and it keeps coming
and it keeps coming and it keeps coming
and it keeps coming 'til the day it stops

i wish that we could talk about it
but there, that's the problem
with someone new i could have started
too late for beginnings
you're smaller than my wife imagined
surprised you were human
there shouldn't be this radio silence
but what are the options?

when someone great is gone, when someone great is gone
when someone great is gone, when someone great is gone
when someone great is gone, when someone great is gone
when someone great is gone, when someone great is gone
we're safe
for the moment
saved
for the moment

i can't get no sleep
i can't get no sleep
i need to sleep, i can't get no sleep
 i need to sleep 
deep in the bosom of the gentle night
is when i search for the light, pick up my pen and start to write
i struggle and fight dark forces in the clear moonlight
without fear.. insomnia..
i can't get no sleep
i can't get no sleep
i used to worry, thought i was going mad in a hurry
gettin' stressed makin' excess mess in darkness
no electricity, something's all over me
greasy insomnia, please release me and let me dream of
makin' mad love to my girl on the heath
tearin' off tights with my teeth
but there's no release, no peace, i toss and turn without cease
like a curse, open my eyes, rise like yeast
at least a couple of weeks since i last slept, kept takin' sleepers..
but now i keep myself pepped
deeper still, the night, i write by candle light i find insight
from the mental movement
so when it's black, this insomniac takes an original tack
keep the beast in my nature under ceaseless attack.. i gets no sleep..
i can't get no sleep
i can't get no sleep
i can't get no sleep
i need to sleep, i can't get no sleep..
i need to sleep, i can't get no sleep...


oh yeah
what we're living in
let me tell ya

and it's a wonder man can eat at all
when things are big that should be small
who can tell what magic spells we'll be doing for us
and i'm giving all my love to this world
only to be told
i can't see
i can't breathe
no more will we be
and nothing's going to change the way we live
'cause we can always take but never give
and now that things are changing for the worse
see, it's a crazy world we're living in
and i just can't see that half of us immersed in sin
is all we have to give these  

future's made of virtual insanity
now always seem to, be governed by this love we have
for useless, twisting, our new technology
oh, now there is no sound
for we all live underground

and i'm thinking what a mess we're in
hard to know where to begin
if i could slip the sickly ties that earthly man has made
and now every mother, can choose the colour
of her child
that's not nature's way
well that's what they said yesterday
there's nothing left to do but pray
i think it's time i found a new religion
whoa, it's so insane to synthesize another strain
there's something in these futures that we have to be told

future's made of virtual insanity
now always seem to, be governed by this love we have
for useless, twisting, our new technology
oh, now there is no sound
for we all live underground

now there is no sound
if we all live underground
and now it's virtual insanity
forget your virtual reality
oh, there's nothing so bad
oh yeah, i know yeah

of this virtual insanity, we're livin' in
has got to change, yeah
things, will never be the same
and i can't go on
while we're livin' in oh, oh virtual insanity
oh, this world, has got to change
'cause i just, i just can't keep going on, it was virtual
virtual insanity that we're livin' in, that we're livin' in
that virtual insanity is what it is
yeah

future's made of virtual insanity
now always seem to, be governed by this love we have
for useless, twisting, our new technology
oh, now there is no sound
for we all live underground
yes we do

oh, now there's nothing that we live in
it's all  ? 
out of window, you know
there is nothing worse than a rambling man
there is nothing worse than a foolish mind
virtual insanity is what we're living in
yeah, well it's alright now


kill me if you dare
hold my head up everywhere
keep myself right on this train
i'm the underdog
live my life on a lullaby
keep myself riding on this train
keep myself riding on this train

love in technicolor, sprayed out on walls
well i've been pounding at the pavement
'til there's nothing at all
i got my cloak and dagger
in a bar room brawl
see the local loves a fighter
loves a winner to fall

feels like i'm lost in a moment
i'm always losing to win
can't get away from the moment
seems like it's time to begin

kill me if you dare
hold my head up everywhere
keep myself right on this train
i'm the underdog
live my life on a lullaby
keep myself riding on this train
keep myself riding on this train

it don't matter
i won't do what you say
you've got the money and the power
i won't go your way
i can't take for the people
they don't matter at all
and i'll be waiting in the shadows
'til the day that you fall

feels like i'm lost in a moment
i'm always losing to win
can't get away from the moment
seems like it's time  to begin

kill me if you dare
hold my head up everywhere
keep myself right on this train
i'm the underdog
live my life on a lullaby
keep myself riding on this train

tell me if you're down
throw your weapons to the ground
keep myself right on this train
paper on the wire
sold your soul for another one
keep myself riding on this train
keep myself riding on this train


finer worlds that you uncover
plant the path you want to roam
live where your heart can be given
and your life starts to unfold

you think you can't, you wish you could
i know you can, i wish you would
so trip inside this house as you pass by
trip inside this house as you pass by

if your limbs begin dissolving
in the water that you tread
all surroundings are evolving
in the stream that clears your head

come disciples to thee unending
subtleties of rhythm power
so trip inside this house as you pass by
trip inside this house as you pass by

trip, trip, trip inside
trip, trip, trip inside

sweep the shadows from your eyes
sweep the realm of dark aside
so trip inside this house as you pass by
trip inside this house as you pass by

trip, trip, trip inside
trip, trip, trip inside
trip, trip, trip inside
trip, trip, trip inside

please excuse me but i got to ask
are you only being nice because you want something?
my fairy tale arrow pierces
be careful how you respond, 'cause you might end up in this song
i never gave you an encouragement
and it's doing me in, doing me in, doing me in, doing me in

the more you try to erase me
the more, the more, the more that i appear
oh, the more, the more
the more you try the eraser
the more, the more, the more that you appear

you know all the answers so why do you ask?
i am only being nice because i want someone, something
you're like a kitten with a ball of yarn
and it's doing me in, doing me in, doing me in, doing me in

the more you try to erase me
the more, the more, the more that i appear
oh, the more, the more
the more i try to erase you
the more, the more, the more that you appear

no, you're wrong, you are wrong
you are wrong, you are wrong
you are wrong, you are wrong
you're wrong


all of my mouth was kissing him
now, into the air, i am missing him
is this excess texting a blessing?
two music nerds obsessing

he reminds me of the love in me
i'm celebrating on a vibrancy
sending each other mp3s
falling in love to a song

this handsomest of wickermen
he asked if i could wait for him
now, how many lightyears this interim
while i fall in love with his songs?

his hands are good in protecting me
touching and caressing me
but would it be trespassing
wanting him to be blissing me
robbing him of his youth?

cliffhanger like suspension
my longing has formed its own skeleton
bridging the gap between singletons
sending each others these songs

the interior of these melodies
is perhaps where we are meant to be
our physical union a fantasy
i just fell in love with a song

so, i reserve my own intimacies
i bundle them up in packages
my rawward longing far too visceral
did i just fall in love with love?


every time i leave you girl
he s the one that s near you girl, oh, i
even as i drive away
i can hear the words he ll say, oh, i

i guess i don t need her
it doesn t mean i can t get over her
where you gonna go without me tonight?
don t you know what that means to me?

you were in my dream again
and i could see you kissing him, oh, girl
why d you have to change your mind
just as i was changing mine? oh, girl

i wish i d never met you
it doesn t mean i can t get over you
what you gonna do without me tonight?
don't you know what you did to me?


what can you buy
that lifts a heavy heart up to the sky?
what makes your day?
what miracle of life
has come to stay?
a taste of love
so sweet, so real you can't let go
and how does it feel?
it feels so good...

but how much do you need?
how much, how much do you need?
how much do you need?
how much, how much do you need?
i want a nice car
a girlfriend
who's as pretty as a star
i want respect
as much, as much as i can get

restless
i feel so restless
and in this changing world
i am lost for words
i feel so restless
ain't got no interest
i couldn't care less
can't be a success

due to current studies
the fiscal climate isn't looking good
get out of town
the streets are running  rivers full of blood
the more i see
the less, the less that i believe
the more i hear
the less, the less that i perceive

restless
i feel so restless
and in this changing world
i am lost for words
i feel so restless
ain't got no interest
i couldn't care less
can't be a success
what can you buy
that lifts a heavy heart up to the sky?
what makes your day?
what miracle of life
has come to stay?
a taste of love
so sweet, so real you can't let go
and how does it feel?
it feels so good...

restless
i am so restless
and this changing world
leaves me speechless
i am lost for words
but i kept my nerve
but it's not hopeless
if you take rest


i couldn't speak so i slurred while i looked for a word
but you left just before i could find it
i sat by myself and i stared at the pictures of you on the wall

i kissed the floor, curled up in a ball
there's nothing coming out of my mouth so i said nothing at all

babe, you've got a face like thunder
always trying to get out with another
just stay still 'til i say it's over
babe, you've got a face like thunder

and you question your lover, did she really believe
that this new taste of love is obsolete?  
it just couldn't compete and so you ll keep dragging your body through life by the hair so you can say that you've been somewhere and you don't care of your receipt
you're sentenced to death and you can't be reprieved

babe, you've got a face like thunder
always trying to get out with another
just stay still 'til i say it's over
babe, you've got a face like thunder

say sorry for a while, for a while, for a while
you know i didn't mean it

hey, honey, what you trying to say?
as i stand here, don't you walk away
and the world comes tumbling down
hand in hand in a violent life
making love on the edge of a knife
and the world comes tumbling down

and it's hard for me to say
and it's hard for me to stay
i'm going down to be by myself
i'm going back for the good of my health
and there's one thing i couldn't do
sacrifice myself to you
sacrifice

baby, baby, i just can't see
just what you mean to me
i take my aim and i fake my words
i'm just your longtime curse
and if you walk away
i can't take it

but that's the way that you are
and that's the things that you say
but now you've gone too far
with all the things you say
get back to where you come from
i can't help it, under the april skies
under the april skies
under the april sun
under the april skies

under the april sun
under the april sun
under the april skies
under the april sun
under the april skies

the sun grows cold, the sky gets black
and you broke me up and now you won't come back
shaking hand, life is dead
and a broken heart and a screaming head
hey, hey

under the april skies
under the april sun
under the april skies
under the april skies

chestnuts roasting on an open fire
jack frost nipping at your nose
yuletide carols being sung by a choir
and folks dressed up like eskimos
everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
help to make the season bright
tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
will find it hard to sleep tonight
they know that santa's on his way
he's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
and every mother's child is gonna spy
to see if reindeer really know how to fly
so i'm offering this simple phrase
to kids from one to ninety two
although it's been said many times, many ways
merry christmas to you
so i'm offering this simple phrase

she said "how did we get ourselves so lost?"
and i said "i don't know, but we will not be leaving tonight, tonight
when you hold me i, i feel better"
i only want one night, together in our arms
this is the longest night, we're meeting arms to arms

nothing is wasted and life is worth living

everything's nothing, and nothing is ours

then we would live and prosper
but i doubt it
we are a violent race
and we deserve what we get
when you hold me, when you hold me
i feel better, i feel better'

i'm on it, get on it
the troops are on fire
you know i need it much closer
i'm trading just a little more
step on it, electronic
the troops are on fire
i'm much deeper, a sleeper
i'm waiting for the final trip
come on it, get on it
i'm carving through a letter bomb
i need it like potions
these drugs are just an hour away
come on it, electronic
a polyphonic prostitute
the motor's on fire
messiah for the animals

oh come on
we got our backs to the wall
get on and watch out, say
you're gonna kill us all

i've seen it all, i have seen the trees
i've seen the willow leaves dancing in the breeze
i've seen a man killed by his best friend
and lives that were over before they were spent
i've seen what i was   i know what i'll be
i've seen it all   there is no more to see 

you haven't seen elephants, kings or peru 
i'm happy to say i had better to do
what about china? have you seen the great wall?
all walls are great, if the roof doesn't fall 

and the man you will marry?
the home you will share?
to be honest, i really don't care...

you've never been to niagara falls?
i have seen water, it's water, that's all...
the eiffel tower, the empire state?
my pulse was as high on my very first date 
your grandson's hand as he plays with your hair?
to be honest, i really don't care...

i've seen it all, i've seen the dark
i've seen the brightness in one little spark
i've seen what i chose and i've seen what i need
and that is enough, to want more would be greed
i've seen what i was and i know what i'll be
i've seen it all   there is no more to see 

you've seen it all and all you have seen
you can always review on your own little screen
the light and the dark, the big and the small
just keep in mind   you need no more at all
you've seen what you were and know what you'll be
you've seen it all   there is no more to see 


i thought that i was dreaming when you said you loved me
the start of nothing, i had no chance to prepare
i couldn't see you coming
the start of nothing, i could hate you now
it's quite alright to hate me now
when we both know that deep down
the feeling still deep down is good

if i could see through walls, i could see you're faking
if you could see my thoughts, you would see our faces
safe in my rental like an armored truck back then
we didn't give a fuck back then
i ain't a kid no more, we'll never be those kids again
we'd drive to syd's, had the x6 back then, back then
no matter what i did, my waves wouldn't dip back then
everything sucked back then, we were friends

i thought that i was dreaming when you said you loved me
the start of nothing, i had no chance to prepare
i couldn't see you coming
the start of nothing, i could hate you now
it's quite alright to hate me now
but we both know that deep down
the feeling still deep down is good

in the halls of your hotel
arm around my shoulder so i could tell
how much i meant to you, meant it sincere back then
we had time to kill back then
you ain't a kid no more, we'll never be those kids again
it's not the same, ivory's illegal, don't you remember?

i broke your heart last week
you'll probably feel better by the weekend
still remember, had you going crazy
screaming my name, the feeling deep down is good

i thought that i was dreaming when you said you loved me
the start of nothing, had no chance to prepare
couldn't see you coming
and we started from nothing, i could hate you now
it's alright to hate me now
we both know that deep down
the feeling still deep down is good

all the things i didn't mean to say, i didn't mean to do
there were things you didn't need to say
did you mean to? mean to...
i've been dreaming of you, dreaming of you
i've been dreaming of you, dreaming of you
i've been dreaming, dreaming


i ain't easy and i make you mad
'least i ain't sleazy
i'm just trying to put the world to rights
if you want to i'll take you out
and i got the feeling
that i'm going to keep you up all 
going to keep you up all 
going to keep you up all night

tired of taking orders
coping with disorders
the wrong men have the power
it's turning my milk sour
turning my milk sour
turning my milk sour

i ain't easy and i make you mad
'least i ain't sleazy
i'm just trying to put the world to rights
if you want to i'll take you out
and i got the feeling
that i'm going to keep you up all night
i ain't easy, but i ain't that bad
no rhyme or reason
i'm just trying to set the world alight
you got problems? well, so have i
and i got the feeling
that i'm going to keep you up all 
going to keep you up all 
going to keep you up all night

there's cobras in the moshpit
finally we lost it
every day is brutal
now we're being watched by google
got to keep it simple
sending out a signal
everyone's on bugle
now we're being watched by google
being watched by google
being watched by google

i ain't easy and i make you mad
'least i ain't sleazy
i'm just trying to put the world to rights
if you want to i'll take you out

i know it's nothing more than flutes
but something in my heart is loose
there's never been a better day
and if there is nothing more
then nothing more will add, i say
there's never been a better day

deciding never taught me a thing
a wooden box breathes the way
never again, never again
never again, never again

all this talk is getting me down
nothing's making sense in my brain
i m moving words across the terrain
trying hard to fix to the page
i m wedded to the thought that we came
only to discover our names
and blow a horn of love in refrain
and watch things drop down

you'll be given love
you'll be taken care of
you'll be given love
you have to trust it

maybe not from the sources
you have poured yours
maybe not from the directions
you are staring at

twist your head around
it's all around you
all is full of love
all around you

all is full of love
you just ain't receiving
all is full of love
your phone is off the hook
all is full of love
your doors are all shut

that's how it starts
we go back to your house
you check the charts
and start to figure it out
and if it's crowded, all the better
because we know we're gonna be up late
but if you're worried about the weather
then you picked the wrong place to stay
that's how it starts
and so it starts
you switch the engine on
we set controls for the heart of the sun
one of the ways we show our age
and if the sun comes up, if the sun comes up
if the sun comes up and i still don't wanna stagger home
then it's the memory of our betters
that are keeping us on our feet
you spent the first five years trying to get with the plan
and the next five years trying to be with your friends again
you're talking forty five turns just as fast as you can
yeah, i know it gets tired, but it's better when we pretend
it comes apart
the way it does in bad films
except in parts
when the moral kicks in
though we're running out of the drugs
and the conversation's grinding away
i wouldn't trade one stupid decision
for another five years of life
you drop the first ten years just as fast as you can
and the next ten people who are trying to be believed
when you're blowing eighty five days in the middle of this
yeah, i know it gets tired only wearing on friends tonight
to tell the truth
oh, this could be the last time
so when we go
like a sail's force into the night
and if i made a fool, if i made a fool
if i made a fool on the road, there's always this
and if i'm sewn into submission
i can still come home to this
and with a face like a dad and a laughable stand
you leave conceit on the plane or review what you said
when you're drunk and the kids look impossibly tired
you think over and over, hey, i finally did
oh, if the trip and the plan come apart in your hand
you look concerted on yourself your ridiculous prop
you forgot what you meant when you read what you said
and you always knew you were tired, but then
where are your friends tonight?
where are your friends tonight?
where are your friends tonight?
if i could see all my friends tonight
if i could see all my friends tonight
if i could see all my friends tonight
if i could see all my friends tonight


you wanted a hit
but maybe we don't do hits
i try and try, it ends up feeling kind of wrong
you wanted it tough
but is it ever tough enough?
no, nothing's ever tough enough
until we hit the road
and you wanted it lush
but honestly, you must hush
no, honestly, you know too much
so leave us, leave us on our own

you wanted a hit
well, this is how we do hits
you wanted a hit
but that's not what we do, sugar

you wanted it real
but can you tell me what's real?
we've got lights and sounds and stories, music's just a part
then you wanted the truth
and then you said you want proof
i guess you're used to liars saying what they want

still, we won't be your babies anymore
we won't be your babies anymore
we won't be your babies 'til you take us home
and we won't be your babies anymore
we won't be your babies anymore
we can't be your babies 'til you take us home

you wanted it smart
but honestly, i'm not smart
no, honestly, i'm never smart
we fake it, fake it all the time
then you wanted the time
but maybe i can't do time
we both know that's an awful line
but this doesn't make it wrong
you wanted it right
no out of mine and out of sight
no filthy bus and early flight
no seven days and forty nights

you wanted a hit
please tell me, where's the point in it?
you wanted a hit
but that's not what we do

still, we won't be your babies anymore
we won't be your babies anymore
we won't be your babies 'til you take us home
and we won't be your babies anymore
we won't be your babies anymore
we can't be your babies 'til you take us home
and we won't be your babies anymore
we won't be your babies anymore
we won't be your babies 'til you take us home
and we won't be your babies anymore
we won't be your babies anymore
we won't be your babies 'til you take us home, sugar


sssh, sssh

sssh, sssh
it's oh, so still
sssh, sssh
you're all alone
sssh, sssh
and so peaceful until

you fall in love
zing boom
the sky up above
zing boom
is caving in
wow bam

you've never been so nuts about a guy
you want to laugh, you wanna cry
you cross your heart and hope to die

'til it's over, and then
sssh, sssh
it's nice and quiet
sssh, sssh
but soon again
sssh, sssh
starts another big riot

you blow a fuse
zing boom
the devil cuts loose
zing boom
so what's the use
wow bam
of falling in love?

it's, oh, so quiet
it's oh, so still
you're all alone
and so peaceful until

you ring the bell
bim bam
you shout and you yell
hi ho ho
you broke the spell

gee, this is swell, you almost have a fit
this guy is "gorge" and i got hit
there's no mistake, this is it

'til it's over and then
it's nice and quiet
sssh, sssh
but soon again
sssh, sssh
starts another big riot

you blow a fuse
zing boom
the devil cuts loose
zing boom
so what's the use
wow bam
of falling in love?

the sky caves in
the devil cuts loose
you blow, blow, blow, blow, blow your fuse
when you fall in love
sssh

ooo heh hey
oh
what we re living in
let me tell ya
it's a wonder man can eat at all
when things are big that should be small
who can tell
what magic spells
we ll be doing for us
and i m giving all my love to this world
only to be told
i can t see
i can t breathe
no more will we be
and nothing s going to change the way we live
 cause we can always take but never give
and now that things are changing for the worse, see
whoa
it s a crazy world we re living in
and i just can t see that half of us immersed in sin is all we have to give these
futures
made of
virtual insanity, now always
seem to
be governed by this love we have for, useless
twisting
of our new technology, oh now there is no sound
for we all live underground
and i m thinking what a mess we re in
hard to know where to begin
if i could slip
the sickly ties that earthly man has made
and now every mother
can choose the colour
of her child
that s not nature s way
well that s what they said yesterday
there s nothing left to do but pray
i think it s time to find a new religion
whoa, it s so insane
to synthesize another strain
there s something in these futures that we have to be told
futures
made of
virtual insanity, now always
seem to
be governed by this love we have for useless
twisting
of our new technology, oh now there is no sound
for we all live underground, whoa
now there is no sound
if we all live underground
and now it's virtual insanity
forget your virtual reality
oh
there's nothing so bad
as a man made man
oh, yeah
i know yeah
i know i can't go on
ooh
of this virtual insanity we're living in
has got to change
yeah
things
will never be the same
and i can't go on
where we're living in
oh
oh, virtual insanity
oh, this world
has got to change
'cause i just
i just can't keep going on in this virtual
virtual insanity
that we're living in
where we're living in
and that virtual insanity is what it is
yeah
ooh
futures
made of
virtual insanity, now always
seem to
be governed by this love we have for useless
twisting
of our new technology, oh now there is no sound
for we all live underground, oh
futures
made of
now virtual insanity
now we all, we seem to be governed
by a love for this useless twisting
of our new technology
and now there is no sound
for we all live underground
yes we do
oh
now this life that we live in
it's all going wrong
out of the window
do you know
that
there is nothing worse than
a man made man
i feel there's nothing worse than
a foolish man
hey
virtual insanity is what we're living in
yeah
it is alright?


heard a shout and someone calling
strained in darkness
vapour, like a veil, hangs over
the city tonight

hanging there behind the trees
a blood red moon is watching
i was waiting for you
dread in my heart

where the wind sings by the river
laughing, broken
hair swept out into the water
ripples of black

run, you better run
you better run for your life

oh, it rips through the sky
oh, a light flickers on
jo, i know you would say
 don t wait for me now 

shiver while you re breathe in
hold on while you breathe loud
i see the dawn
shiver while you breathe in
hold on while i breath loud

filigree of time demeaning
sunset, spoken
where the wind sings by the river
ripples of black

days, you gotta run
you gotta run for your life
run, you better run
you better run for your life

days, you gotta run
you gotta run for your life
run, you better run
you better run for your life

days, you gotta run
you gotta run for your life
run, you better run
you better run for your life

oh, you live 'til you breathe
don t run with me
breathe your life while you wait
don t wait for me now

instrumental


tell me, tell me
is life just a playground?
think you're the real deal, honey?
and someone will always look out for you?

but wake up, baby
you're so totally deluded
you'll end up old and lonely
if you don't get a bullet in your head

good luck, good luck
good luck in your new bed
enjoy your nightmares, honey
when you're resting your head
good luck, good luck
good luck in your new bed
enjoy your nightmares, honey
when you're resting your head

you sold me, sold me
you sold me down the river now
i hope you're feeling happy now
now you always have a sneer in your smile

but wake up, baby
you're so totally deluded
you'll end up old and lonely
if you don't get a bullet in your head

good luck, good luck
good luck in your new bed
enjoy your nightmares, honey
when you're resting your head
good luck, good luck
good luck in your new bed
enjoy your nightmares, honey
when you're resting your head

and i'm glad, so glad, that i'm done with you
no more crying, crying
leaving me so black and blue
you backed me up against the wall
but i stand tall, don't give a damn no more
oh, baby, bye bye
no more lies
no more lies
no more lies
without you

good good luck
in your new bed
enjoy your nightmares
when you're resting your head
good, good luck
in your new bed
enjoy your nightmares

i guess we'll never get started
let's save the silence all night
no need for talking about it
sometimes, the quiet feels so right

high
over the north star
sleepless, so far
together, we are
high
trapped in the holiday affair
a new silence filled the air

i rest my head on your shoulder
there's nowhere else i'd rather be
right there, a little bit slower
feel free to roll another one for me
 roll another one for me 

high
over the north star
sleepless, so far
together, we are
high
trapped in the holiday affair
a new silence filled the air

making way, we sway, we slide, oh
one flight to space, soothing you
it's too good to be true, have more on a rooftop view
making way, we sway, we slide, oh

high
over the north star
sleepless, so far
together, we are
high
trapped in the holiday affair
a new silence filled the air

high
high
high

i can't get no sleep
i can't get no sleep
i need to sleep, i can't get no sleep
 i need to sleep 
deep in the bosom of the gentle night
is when i search for the light, pick up my pen and start to write
i struggle and fight dark forces in the clear moonlight
without fear.. insomnia..
i can't get no sleep
i can't get no sleep
i used to worry, thought i was going mad in a hurry
gettin' stressed makin' excess mess in darkness
no electricity, something's all over me
greasy insomnia, please release me and let me dream of
makin' mad love to my girl on the heath
tearin' off tights with my teeth
but there's no release, no peace, i toss and turn without cease
like a curse, open my eyes, rise like yeast
at least a couple of weeks since i last slept, kept takin' sleepers..
but now i keep myself pepped
deeper still, the night, i write by candle light i find insight
from the mental movement
so when it's black, this insomniac takes an original tack
keep the beast in my nature under ceaseless attack.. i gets no sleep..
i can't get no sleep
i can't get no sleep
i can't get no sleep
i need to sleep, i can't get no sleep..
i need to sleep, i can't get no sleep...

we're changing our ways, taking different roads

love will tear us apart again
love will tear us apart again

why is the bedroom so cold? you've turned away on your side
is my timing that flawed? our respect runs so dry
yet there's still this appeal that we've kept through our lives

love will tear us apart again
love will tear us apart again

you cry out in your sleep, all my failings exposed
and there's a taste in my mouth as desperation takes hold
just that something so good just can't function no more

love will tear us apart again
love will tear us apart again
love will tear us apart again
love will tear us apart again





everyone's updating their hardware
plugging in their new gear
upgrading to all new components
replacing the things from last year
every time i hear something special
its replacement is something i fear
it's only a working in progress
only a stopgap idea
the tools that we used to create them
they're no longer welcome 'round here
everyone's re routing their cables
creating paths that are crystal clear
while i like the sound of you dreaming
i like how it sounds in my ear
and i like the sound of adventure
the wind chimes in the air
in this world you've created
there are sounds i'll always hold dear
i'd like things to be permanent
but that's not always possible, i fear
bring me something back when you go
bring me something back when you go
bring me something back i don't know
bring me something back when you go
everyone's deleting their plugins
their path must remain crystal clear
everyone's sick of their soft synths
like they're sick of cold lager beer
i don't know a real ale from a fake one
i don't know which is more sincere
the music we're making
or the music we hear
make your own kind of problems
make something out of your fears
make your own music
let it bring you to tears
bring me something back when you go
 will you ride with me for one last time? 
bring me something back when you go
 i'll be on electric lines 
bring me something back when you go
 i can hear the signal passing through 
bring me something back i don't know
 they know what we plan to do 


hold on tight, you've got a way to go
you're terrified by the open road
in a daze, you've lost control
you've found a gang
and it makes you feel better than the other girls

and you pray they're just boys, they're not villains
one's got religious tattoos, he'll be forgiven

let go, there is nothing more to hide
seeing life through closed eyes
it's just a young understanding
you know, that time is on your side
seeing life through closed eyes
it's just a young understanding

cruising round in a friend's new car
you've always know they won't get you far
found yourself on a downward slope
it's ok, cause it makes you feel better than the other girls

and you pray they're just boys, they're not villains
one's got religious tattoos, he'll be forgiven

let go, there is nothing more to hide
seeing life through closed eyes
it's just a young understanding
you know, that time is on your side
seeing life through closed eyes
it's just a young understanding

torn apart, can't you see?
they left their hearts in the 70's
reach for a sign, reach for an understanding
reach for a sign, reach for an understanding
reach for a sign, reach for an understanding
reach for a sign, reach for an understanding

let go, there is nothing more to hide
seeing life through closed eyes
it's just a young understanding
you know, that time is on your side
seeing life through closed eyes
it's just a young understanding

reach for a sign
it's just a young understanding
reach for a sign
it's just a young understanding

you drain down to the gutter
so bad it bites reality
echoing sounds of your lover
you tie down your breath for a while
may take some time, sometime
find a dime and i shiver
who cares where you carry your name
tied down by your lover
break my heart and leave you maim
that's you, that's you, that's you
 try on 
you cannot make time go backwards
or make it run fast forward
it will go on without you
clear is my mind echoing throughout within you
lay my heart down easy in your hands
found our hearts are made to shiver
so right would you play me again
shared by one another
the tears in our veins
make your pause
and i'll deliver my gold, i've sold my gold
making my heart work harder
so it can beat much faster
it will go on within me
after my time of passing through
within you
you cannot make time go backwards
or make it run fast forward
it will go on without you
clear is my mind echoing throughout within you


just one fight and just one anniversary
so i never thought you'd be the one to up and leave
you said our love was written in the stars
but i never paid attention to my charts
but now i see how quick you must want to forget
'cause you left the ring i bought you with your cigarettes
well, i can finish up if you don't want them
and i can take the ring back where i got it from

i can love it or i can leave it
you said, "honey, i best be leaving
'cause you're a novice, and i'm a taurus"
and i'm not gonna say, i'm not gonna do
i can love it or i can leave it
you said, "honey, i best be leaving"
'cause you're a taurus and i'm aquarius
and i'm not gonna say, i'm not gonna do

never thought about it sentimentally
never saw just how much you thought i meant to me
never learned about it at university
never thought about it 'cause you're the first, you see
and i'm aware of the procedure
but normally it's me that leaves her
i guess i'm finished up, it's time to move on
i'm taking the ring back to where i got it from

i can love it or i can leave it
you said, "honey, i best be leaving
'cause you're a novice and i'm a taurus
and i'm not gonna say, i'm not gonna do"
i can love it or i can leave it
you said, "honey, i best be leaving
'cause you're a novice and i'm a taurus
and we've had problems, we're notorious for them"
it's what your friends said now, you're inside there now
i've seen our stars and there's nothing aligning
that's 'cause i'm aquarius, yeah, i'm aquarius

i'm aquarius, i'm aquarius
i'm aquarius, i'm aquarius
i'm aquarius, i'm aquarius
i'm aquarius, i'm aquarius
i'm aquarius, i'm aquarius
i'm aquarius, i'm aquarius
i'm aquarius, i'm aquarius
i'm aquarius, i'm aquarius

i can't get no sleep
i can't get no sleep
i need to sleep, i can't get no sleep
 i need to sleep 
deep in the bosom of the gentle night
is when i search for the light, pick up my pen and start to write
i struggle and fight dark forces in the clear moonlight
without fear.. insomnia..
i can't get no sleep
i can't get no sleep
i used to worry, thought i was going mad in a hurry
gettin' stressed makin' excess mess in darkness
no electricity, something's all over me
greasy insomnia, please release me and let me dream of
makin' mad love to my girl on the heath
tearin' off tights with my teeth
but there's no release, no peace, i toss and turn without cease
like a curse, open my eyes, rise like yeast
at least a couple of weeks since i last slept, kept takin' sleepers..
but now i keep myself pepped
deeper still, the night, i write by candle light i find insight
from the mental movement
so when it's black, this insomniac takes an original tack
keep the beast in my nature under ceaseless attack.. i gets no sleep..
i can't get no sleep
i can't get no sleep
i can't get no sleep
i need to sleep, i can't get no sleep..
i need to sleep, i can't get no sleep...


taking it slow, saving up, she
before she knows it, all i ask before she goes home
she's tired of crying and sick of his lies
she's suffered him for far too many years of her life
feeling low and scared that he'll say
do you know how, over time, you drove her away?
saving up for the day when she goes
the day that she stands up for everything that she chose

she can say, she can say
she can say, she can say
she can say, she can say
who knows what she's gonna say?
she can say, she can say

she can say, she can say
she can say, she can say
she can say, she can say
who knows what she's gonna say?
she can say

saving up for the day when she goes
the day that she stands up for everything that she chose
taking the kids and driving away
turn around the life she let him siphon away
and i've been with you for all of these years
tell you what i've got to show for all of my tears
the times you hurt me and treated me wrong
something had to give to stop this thing from going on

she can say, she can say
she can say, she can say
she can say, she can say
who knows what she's gonna say?
she can say, she can say
she can say, she can say
she can say, she can say
who knows what she's gonna say?
she can say


she can say, she can say

do you know how, over time, you drove her away?

ooo heh hey
oh
what we re living in
let me tell ya
it's a wonder man can eat at all
when things are big that should be small
who can tell
what magic spells
we ll be doing for us
and i m giving all my love to this world
only to be told
i can t see
i can t breathe
no more will we be
and nothing s going to change the way we live
 cause we can always take but never give
and now that things are changing for the worse, see
whoa
it s a crazy world we re living in
and i just can t see that half of us immersed in sin is all we have to give these
futures
made of
virtual insanity, now always
seem to
be governed by this love we have for, useless
twisting
of our new technology, oh now there is no sound
for we all live underground
and i m thinking what a mess we re in
hard to know where to begin
if i could slip
the sickly ties that earthly man has made
and now every mother
can choose the colour
of her child
that s not nature s way
well that s what they said yesterday
there s nothing left to do but pray
i think it s time to find a new religion
whoa, it s so insane
to synthesize another strain
there s something in these futures that we have to be told
futures
made of
virtual insanity, now always
seem to
be governed by this love we have for useless
twisting
of our new technology, oh now there is no sound
for we all live underground, whoa
now there is no sound
if we all live underground
and now it's virtual insanity
forget your virtual reality
oh
there's nothing so bad
as a man made man
oh, yeah
i know yeah
i know i can't go on
ooh
of this virtual insanity we're living in
has got to change
yeah
things
will never be the same
and i can't go on
where we're living in
oh
oh, virtual insanity
oh, this world
has got to change
'cause i just
i just can't keep going on in this virtual
virtual insanity
that we're living in
where we're living in
and that virtual insanity is what it is
yeah
ooh
futures
made of
virtual insanity, now always
seem to
be governed by this love we have for useless
twisting
of our new technology, oh now there is no sound
for we all live underground, oh
futures
made of
now virtual insanity
now we all, we seem to be governed
by a love for this useless twisting
of our new technology
and now there is no sound
for we all live underground
yes we do
oh
now this life that we live in
it's all going wrong
out of the window
do you know
that
there is nothing worse than
a man made man
i feel there's nothing worse than
a foolish man
hey
virtual insanity is what we're living in
yeah
it is alright?


i was a liar
i'll never be holy in your eyes
but you'll never be either
'cause i know that underneath your smile
hides the nights that you regret and the days you can't forget
'cause you know me
and we'll never be holy

i've been keeping to myself
and looking back over my shoulder
trying to live my life just like somebody else
and forget all the empty words i told ya

i'm a mess, these demons follow me home
it's easy to bury the guilt on my own
now my fears will finally swallow me whole
'cause i wasn't honest
and i never wanted to admit that

i was a liar
i'll never be holy in your eyes
but you'll never be either
'cause i know that underneath your smile
hides the nights that you regret and the days you can't forget
'cause you know me
and we'll never be holy

it's a sickness i can't seem to shake
'til i wake up alone and ashamed
or a tie that i'm too scared to break
in case i'm drunk and i need you again
i was never the one
i was always just easy
you would lend me enough to follow through
maybe when you're alone
and you look in the mirror
well, you can feel as low as i do

just a mess, these demons follow you home
it's easy to bury the guilt on your own
now your fears will finally swallow you whole
but i wasn't honest
and you never wanted to admit that

i was a liar
i'll never be holy in your eyes
but you'll never be either
'cause i know that underneath your smile
hides the nights that you regret and the days you can't forget
'cause you know me
and we'll never be holy
and we'll never be holy  holy in your eyes 
no, we'll never be holy  holy in your eyes 
'cause the nights that you regret and the days you can't forget
leave you lonely
and we'll never be holy

i'll always be a mess if i keep living this way
despite all my flaws, i still hope you're okay
i don't know if i can honestly say
that it's getting better
but at least together
we were holy


it must be an infestation
something that i can't control
it's an open invitation
to try to find the bottom of a bottomless hole
i wanna see inside the alien
i wanna feel your organs inside out

but i'll give it to you anyhow, anyhow, anyhow

oh, the whole station's gonna burn down

i'm full of good intentions
like i never was before
it's too late for prevention
but i don't think it's too late for cure
so you call in your minions
see what you can't find
night time or morning
these hands are sticky but i don't mind
why must you always be around?
why can't you just leave it be?
it's done nothing so far but destroy my life
you cause as much sorrow dead
as you did when you were alive
i never said i was tough
that was everyone else
so you're a fool to attack me
for the image that you built yourself
it just sounds more vicious
then i actually mean
i really am soft

why must you always be around?
why can't you just leave it be?
you've done nothing so far but destroy my life
you cause as much sorrow dead
as you did when you were alive
why must you always ask me?
why can't you just leave it be?
you've done nothing so far but destroy my life
you cause as much sorrow dead
as you did when you were alive

when you were young and on your own
how did it feel to be alone
i was always thinking of games that i was playing
trying to make the best of my time
but only love can break your heart
try to be sure right from the start
yes, only love can break your heart
but if your world should fall apart
i have a friend i've never seen
he hides his head inside a dream
someone should call him and see if he can come out
try to lose the down that he's found
but only love can break your heart
try to be sure right from the start
yes, only love can break your heart
but if your world should fall apart
i was always thinking... i was always thinking...

has come to take me away
the only one i know
is mine when she stitches me
the only one i see
has found an aching in me
the only one i see
has turned her tongue into me
everyone has been burned before
everybody knows the pain
everyone has been burned before
everybody knows the pain
the only one i know
never cries, never opens her eyes
the only one i know
wide awake and then she's away
the only one i see

the only one i see
has carved her way into me
everyone has been burned before
everybody knows the pain

all in all there's something to do
all in all there's something to live
with you

to get behind this sun and cast this weight of mine

all in all there's something to live
with you


to see age in a flower
the dawns are speeding up
you know it ll hurt you
feel all of a sudden
tired and teary eyed
you knew it d kill you

don t wear a tie that ll choke you
to death in the city
take it off and forget
spare the fret that ll make you
miss all of summer
sweat it out and forgive

to see loss in a shower
the petals turn to mush
it still disappoints you
then less of a sudden
you wire your weary mind
to let it deceive you

don t force a smile that ll make you
resent the city
play it soft and forgive
keep the frown that ll make you
squint in the summer
play it slow and forget


you're up, but you'll get down
you're never running from this town
and i think you said

'cause you're going 'round in circles
and everyone knows you're trouble

because you read it in a big book
and now you're giving me the look, look
but just remember how we shook, shook
and all the things we took, took
this town's the oldest friend of mine

we get up and we get down
we're always running 'round this town
and to think they said
we'd never get anything better than this
'cause we're always in small circles
and everyone thinks we're trouble

we didn't read it in a big book
 we didn't read it in a big book, big book, big book 
and now we're giving you the look, look

i see it everywhere, in every face and every place that i go
i see it in the eyes of all the strangers and the people i know
even in the buildings and the statues on the streets that i walk
even in the voices even though they never say when they talk
you're in love with life
you're in love with life
it is the greatest thing i've ever seen
it is the truth and the light
i watch you in the morning as the sunlight rolls in with the new dawn
i saw you in the evening smiling like it was the day you were born
but even after all you hold your head up, lift your voice and we say
acknowledge all the wonder, and the magic, that the journey might bring
you're in love with life
you're in love with life
it is the greatest thing i've ever seen
it is the truth and the light
you're in love with life
you're in love with life
it is the greatest thing i've ever seen

 there's  too many people, too many dying
too many lying, too many crying
 there's  too many voices, so little choices
at night i lie awake, feels like heartache
feels like heartache, how long will the night take
how long will the night take, it feels like heartache
the night has come, they say i rise crime rate
 can't wait
i rise my fist the thunder break through
make a wish who will you run to
 there's  too many prisons taking away from family
too many reasons to lose your sanity
i lie awake and let the visions take me
think of life and how it tried to break me
had no choice, had to settle
hear a voice now they burn from metal
there's too many shouts and they call it treason
can't relate and hate without reason
 there's  too many guns, pray for god to come quick
he doesn't come, my god is real sick

looks like a new transition
is starting up and shaking your ground
turning your head to see a new day calling
does it feel like a head to lean on
a snapshot from where you were born?
i'm looking for your hand in the rough
you're caught in the wire
well, i'll lift you out
leaning on the action
caught in a cellphone's rays
bleeding on the sofa
staring at the wayside
he's coming and she knows it
even if she knows why
footsteps in the hallway
girl, you haven't got time

you gotta get out
go far away
you gotta get out
go far away
darkness in the bedroom

maybe she was out late
just come back from the club

something doesn't seem right
killer in the hallway

and take my place on the landscapes ice
it's the rest who push the policy dream
affixing life with policy cream
voice your thoughts near big black gates
on bed of rose near bricks and gates
to the sound of nothing as it breaks the spell
there's no witchcraft here, it's just fucking hell

we're in the makings of another role
where we all get the chance to climb on again
it's just the makings of another role
that will turn on us all eventually

yeah, i got a roadworks pose even though i'm free
i mean i can't really moan because you'll have a go at me
so stupid ain't we? we're like pumped up meat
wet and fried and thick to the slice
i got no flies on me, i'm like shit that's white
the kind that you tell your kids to pick up if they like
i got two brown bins, should i only have one?
but what the council don't know won't hurt them

we're in the makings of another role
where we all get the chance to climb on again
it's just the makings of another role
that will turn on us all eventually
we're in the makings of another role
where we all get the chance to climb on again

you. just. give it away
fearless with your life
living day to day

i will not fail nor falter i shall succeed
my perception is altered i do believe
faith is so strong now nothing shall bar my way
firm conviction is no fiction this is my day
i can move move move any mountain
i can move move move any mountain
i can move move move any mountain
i walk so tall ascending i stand so high
earth below me revolving above the sky
i feel no fear to be here is oh so fine
shining brightly like sunlight inside my mind
well you know that any mountain is capable of moving
the shamen and the new generation who are proving
you can be what you want to be
let your soul and your body and your mind be free
well never mind we all are that
and going all the way is where i'm at
with delivery smooth like water from a fountain
that's why i can move any mountain move any mountain
i can move move move any mountain
i can move move move any mountain
i can move move move any mountain
i can move move move any mountain
move any mountain
move any mountain
move any mountain
future feeling new sensation
body is rockin' and the mind is reeling
and rolling racing changing motion
flowing like a river into the ocean
better get yourself ready for the next transition
'cause the time is right for a new vibration
my vision one nation one tribe
one day'll come the might to move any mountain
move any mountain
move any mountain
i can move move move any mountain
i walk so tall ascending i stand so high
earth below me revolving above the sky
i feel no fear to be here is oh so fine
shining brightly like sunlight inside my mind
i can move move move any mountain

i can see clearly now, the rain has gone
i can see all obstacles in my way
gone are the dark clouds that had me blind
it's gonna be a bright, bright sun shining day
it's gonna be a bright, bright sun shining day
i think i can make it now, the pain has gone
all of the bad feelings have disappeared
here is that rainbow i've been praying for
it's gonna be a bright, bright sun shining day
look all around, there's nothing but blue sky
look straight ahead, nothing but blue sky
i can see clearly now, the rain has gone
i can see all obstacles in my way
gone're the dark clouds that had me blind
it's gonna be a bright, bright sun shining day

you promised me the ends of the earth but i don't want that
i just want you to feel the belief of a man
they say that love is drunk but drunk don't let you far
all i want is the you that pulls me back
you promised me the ends of the earth but i don't want that
i just want you to feel the relief of a man
they say that love is drunk but drunk don't get you far
all i want is the you that pulls me back

where i go
you tell me
my voice is
within me
where i go
you spell me
what i start
is complete

i try to keep myself topped up with all this good and bad
don't wanna fall behind the pack and illness send me mad
if you were ever this complete, you've lost yourself
you've lost yourself
you need to reach beyond the star that falls straight from the shelf
you need to reach beyond the star that leads straight to your wealth
you promised me the ends of the earth but i don't want that
i just want you to feel the belief of a man
they say that love is drunk but drunk don't let you far
all i want is the you that pulls me back
you promised me the ends of the earth but i don't want that
i just want you to feel the relief of a man
they say that love is drunk but drunk don't get you far
all i want is the you that pulls me back


flocking to the sea
crowds of people wait for me
sea gulls scavenge
steal ice cream
worries vanish
within my dream
i left my soul there
down by the sea
i lost control here
living free
i left my soul there
down by the sea
i lost control here
living free
fishing boats sail past the shore
no singing may day any more
the sun is shining
the water's clear
just you and i walk along the pier
i left my soul there
down by the sea
i lost control here
living free
i left my soul there
down by the sea
i lost control here
living free
a cool breeze flows but mind the wasp
some get stung it's worth the cost
i'd love to stay
the city calls me home
more hassles fuss and lies on the phone
i left my soul there
down by the sea
i lost control here
living free
i left my soul there
down by the sea
i lost control here
living free
i left my soul there
down by the sea
i lost control here
living free
i left my soul there
down by the sea
living, living
and i, living, by the sea


take me down six underground
the ground beneath your feet
laid out low, nothing to go
nowhere a way to meet

i've got a head full of drought down here
so far off losing out round here
overground, watch this space
i'm open to falling from grace

calm me down, bring it 'round
too way high off your street
i can see like nothing else
in me you're better than i wanna be

don't think 'cause i understand i care
don't think 'cause i'm talking we're friends
overground, watch this space
i'm open to falling from grace

talk me down, safe and sound
too strung up to sleep
wear me out, scream and shout
swear my time's never cheap

i fake my life like i've lived too much
i take whatever you're given, not enough
overground, watch this space
i'm open
i fake my life like i've lived too much
i take whatever you're given, not enough
overground, watch this space
i'm open to falling from grace

i think it's time you take another look around if you're gonna bring a knife into a gunfight bragging how you're sick of hearing every single human being seeing as they're watching but can't see past what they're seeing
you can keep em at bat but put that knife away
always with the wild card you're gonna wanna play cuz you're my implosionatic
my implosion addict
that a boy
don't rock the boat
that a boy
let it implode
i think it's time you take another couple days off
gotta make a conversation such a face off
i'm betting debt is threatening to make it worse
try to hide you're dreaming up an epitaphic verse
you can keep em at bay but put your pills away
always with the wild card you always wanna play
so much for dying before you're 30 or 27 like jan and jim

no more contemplating boo
no more contemplating boo

everyday in his name she begins
to have her shining here by my side

oh yeah i used to know quinnan
he's a real, he's a real jerk


now did you see me, i killed a man
they all stayed down, but he chose to stand
and girl, when did it hit you deep
to watch his mind seep
across the pavement, beat down, slaps the meat
each and every single one of your feet
that you will ever know
the limitations of a clone
they kept me on my throne
the silk space of time
covered in a trace of slime
it's not here to appear for the tears
the mere hatred that flows through the years
the silent calm, washed violent charm
held in the depths of a tyrant's palm
expect the ides, to lay by his side
and bear with the sight of just another man's mind

i must mistake the high
cool these breaks, these stakes will lie
i was not born to be taught
i was born to be exposed in the storm
and held awhile
in the hot heat in the mother
sat by the feet of your lover
feet down, decede one another
i dug through these graves to uncover
a pile of bones mixed with violent tones
forced through the earth with these silent drones
i'll seek through time, evading the mimes
i'll breathe in time and of the guide's sign

you trust these snakes to die?
with all the ways you trace the climb
go up the ladder, made from the latter
made even sadder, but he born to an adder
i'm on the depth of a bridge
you took your time to plant a seed
a seed of hate, the plagues you played
so bear witness to the strength and states
you want to be the body of song
are you strong across this glum
pinnacle of crumbs
see these hands and see what they crave to be done
you are, you are this useless art that's gone too far
you are, you are
you are a body of song
you pave me down to the dirt and scum
look what i've become
see these hands, these actions that i've done
walk bear beaten down
black blue brains out
this drain will be clogged
let their brains be drowned
walk bear beaten down
these black beat brains out
these drains be clogged
these brains be drowned

feet down, decede one another
i dug through these graves uncover
these graves uncover
a pile of bones mixed with violent tones
forced through the earth with these silent drones
a pile of bones



you arrive in the rising sun
the hidden passenger that i've been taking
close your eyes, let's forget again
as you drag me down, i will take you in

what are you waiting for?
just surrender here tonight
what are you waiting for
as we go towards the light?

when everything is said and done
still looking for answers, if only one
turn my back, the urge has gone
left with no reason, we come undone

i am caught in your slow release
seems like your traveler is eager to move me
my reflection will slowly fade
to another time until my head escapes

what are you waiting for?
just surrender here tonight
what are you waiting for
as we go towards the light?

when everything is said and done
still looking for answers, if only one
turn my back, the urge has gone
left with no reason, we come undone

memories and mysteries point to you
take me back ocean blue bring me home
memories and mysteries point to you
dreaming i am going home
deadlights, sweet surprise
see the mourning in her eyes
don't look back, just cut me loose
keep on searching, find the truth
take my hand tonight and see the passage shining bright
eclipsing everything we know

i put my trousers on, have a cup of tea and i think about leaving me house  parklife  
i feed the pigeons, i sometimes feed the sparrows too, it gives me a sense of enormous wellbeing  parklife

tell me a line make it easy for me
open your arms
dance with me until i feel all right
it's good in the dark, good in the dark
but into the lover's light
here comes another fight
so ring the alarm, ring the alarm
bore me and hold me and cling to my arm
here it comes, here it comes
and what you're asking me now, disastrous now
hoping and hoping and hoping
the feeling goes away

never change, never change, never change, never change
never change, never change, never change
this is why i fell in love
never change, never change, never change, never change

 in love... 

this is the time the very best time
so give me a line and take me home
take me over
but dashing the hopes dashing the hopes
and smashing the pride
the morning's got you on the ropes
and love is a murderer, love is a murderer
but if she calls you tonight
everything is all right
yeah, we know
and love is a curse shoved in a hearse
love is an open book to a verse of your bad poetry
and this is coming from me

but i can change, i can change, i can change, i can change
i can change, i can change, i can change
if it helps you fall in love
 fall in love 

turn on the light, make it easy for me
feel the divide, fumble in the kitchen
'til it's right
what an awful sight
but there's love in your eyes
love in your eyes, love in your eyes
but maybe that's just your love of fights
all night 

but i can change, i can change, i can change, i can change
i can change, i can change, i can change
if it helps you fall in love
 in love 

and i can change, i can change, i can change, i can change
i can change, i can change, i can change
if it helps you feel real love
 in love 

and i can change, i can change, i can change, i can change
i can change, i can change, i can change
if it helps you feel real love

new york, i love you but you're bringing me down
new york, i love you but you're bringing me down
like a rat in a cage
pulling minimum wage
new york, i love you but you're bringing me down
new york, you're safer and you're wasting my time
our records all show you were filthy but fine
but they shuttered your stores
when you opened the doors
to the cops who were bored once they'd run out of crime
new york, you're perfect, oh, please don't change a thing
your mild billionaire mayor's now convinced he's a king
so the boring collect
i mean all disrespect
in the neighborhood bars i'd once dreamt i would drink
new york, i love you but you're freaking me out
there's a ton of the twist but we're fresh out of shout
like a death in the hall
that you hear through your wall
new york, i love you but you're freaking me out
new york, i love you but you're bringing me down
new york, i love you but you're bringing me down
like a death of the heart
jesus, where do i start?
but you're still the one pool where i'd happily drown
and oh  take me off your mailing list
for kids who think it still exists
yes, for those who think it still exists
maybe i'm wrong and maybe you're right
maybe i'm wrong and maybe you're right
maybe you're right, maybe i'm wrong
and just maybe you're right
and oh  maybe mother told you true
and there'll always be somebody there for you
and you'll never be alone
but maybe she's wrong and maybe i'm right
and just maybe she's wrong
maybe she's wrong and maybe i'm right
and if so, here's this song 

i can't get no sleep
i can't get no sleep
i need to sleep, i can't get no sleep
 i need to sleep 
deep in the bosom of the gentle night
is when i search for the light, pick up my pen and start to write
i struggle and fight dark forces in the clear moonlight
without fear.. insomnia..
i can't get no sleep
i can't get no sleep
i used to worry, thought i was going mad in a hurry
gettin' stressed makin' excess mess in darkness
no electricity, something's all over me
greasy insomnia, please release me and let me dream of
makin' mad love to my girl on the heath
tearin' off tights with my teeth
but there's no release, no peace, i toss and turn without cease
like a curse, open my eyes, rise like yeast
at least a couple of weeks since i last slept, kept takin' sleepers..
but now i keep myself pepped
deeper still, the night, i write by candle light i find insight
from the mental movement
so when it's black, this insomniac takes an original tack
keep the beast in my nature under ceaseless attack.. i gets no sleep..
i can't get no sleep
i can't get no sleep
i can't get no sleep
i need to sleep, i can't get no sleep..
i need to sleep, i can't get no sleep...

 ich  tr umte so gerne von den freuden der welt
ich hatte manches sch ne mir vorgestellt
und dann kam ein tag und den vergesse ich nie
viel sch ner als meine phantasie
ooh, ooh, k sse s ßer als wein
i dreamed so happily about the joys of the world
i had met a beautiful one
and then came one day that i'll never forget
much more beautiful than my fantasy
ooh, ooh, kisses sweeter than wine


beetles and eggs and blues and poor little everything else
you steam a lens stable eyes and glass
not get pissed off through my burned lips as good news

still being cried and
laughed at from behind
"don't fall behind, miss"
from first my turn's rules

beetles and eggs and blues and bells and eggs and blues
beetles and eggs and blues and poor little everything else
you steam a lens stable eyes and glass
not get pissed off through my burned lips as good news

you'll hang the hearts black and dull as the night
we hanged your pass and start being as you in ecstasy
 still being cried and laughed at before 
should i be sewn in hugged i can by not saying
 still being cried and laughed at from light to blue 

and should i be hugged and tugged down through
this tiger's masque?
and should i be sung and unbroken by not saying
your mind not saying

you'll hang that heart's black and dull as the night
 still being cried and laughed at from behind me, from blues 
we hanged your pass and star being as you in ecstasy
 still being cried and laughed at from behind me, from blues 
should i be sung and unbroken by not saying
 still being cried and laughed at from behind me, from blues 
hugged and tugged down through this tiger's masque for kicks


no new year's day to celebrate
no chocolate covered candy hearts to give away
no first of spring, no song to sing
in fact here's just another ordinary day

no april rain, no flowers bloom
no wedding saturday within the month of june
but what it is is something new
made up of these three words i say to you

i just called to say i love you
i just called to say how much i care
i just called to say i love you
and i mean it from the bottom of my heart

no summer's high
no warm july
no harvest moon to light one tender august night
no autumn breeze
no falling leaves
not even time for birds to fly to southern skies
no libra sun
no halloween
no giving thanks to all the christmas joy you bring
but what it is, though old so new
to fill your heart like no three words could ever do

i just called to say i love you
i just called to say how much i care
i just called to say i love you
and i mean it from the bottom of my heart

i just called to say i love you
i just called to say how much i care
i just called to say i love you
and i mean it from the bottom of my heart

everybody makes mistakes
but i feel alright when i come undone
you're not not making me wait
but it seems alright as long as something's happening
i try to make you late
but you fight me out like a fire does
you try making me wait
but it feels alright as long as something's happening
get your payments from the nation
for your trials and tribulations
you try to make me wait
you come around when it's come undone
everybody makes you late
and it's never you, because you're always thinkin'
i try making you wait
and you give me some like you give it good
everybody makes mistakes
but it seems it's mine that always keep on stingin'
get your payments from the nation
for your trial and tribulations
get your payments from the nation
for your trial and tribulations
you try making me wait
but you come undone when you come undone
everybody makes mistakes
but it's always mine that seem to keep on stickin'

light reflects from your shadow
it is more than i thought could exist
you move through the room
like breathing was easy
if someone believed me

they would be
as in love with you as i am
they would be
as in love with you as i am
they would be
as in love with you as i am
they would be
in love, love, love

and everyday
i am learning about you
the things that no one else sees
and the end comes too soon
like dreaming of angels
and leaving without them
and leaving without them

being
as in love with you as i am
being
as in love with you as i am
being
as in love with you as i am
being
as in love, love, love
love, love, love
love, love, love

and with words unspoken
a silent devotion
i know you know what i mean
and the end is unknown
but i think i'm ready
as long as you're with me

being
as in love with you as i am
being
as in love with you as i am
being
as in love with you as i am
being
as in love, love, love

home, home in the late night
and away, away in the half light
except saturdays, crushed by the boring
and played and plagued by the touring again
when once you had believed it
now you see it's sucking you in
to string you along with the pretense
and pave the way for the coming release
alone and prone in the half light
and late, late to your real life
if you find a way into the gold rush
you will stay until the morning comes
you can normalize
don't it make you feel alive?
you can normalize
don't it make you feel alive?
you can normalize
don't it make you feel alive?
you can normalize
don't it make you feel alive?
you can normalize
don't it make you feel alive?
you can normalize
don't it make you feel alive?
you can normalize
don't it make you feel alive?
you can normalize
don't it make you feel alive?
get innocuous


it's been a long time waiting
been a long time waiting on you, on you
i've got a lot of love riding
i've got a lot of love riding on you, on you

you tell me i can do what i wanna do
you tell me i can be who i wanna be
you lead me here, don't let me down

i leave you my heart, so take it
showed you my hand, your time to play it
i don't want time to change it
i wanna know what's going on
are you gonna tell me?
 are you gonna? 
are you gonna?
 are you gonna? 

you're the one that i believe in
so don't give me no reason to die, oh no
you're the one that i invest in
every minute of every hour

you tell me i'll be safe standing next to you
you tell me you need me like i need you
you lead me here, don't let me down

i leave you my heart, so take it
showed you my hand, your time to play it
i don't want time to change it
i wanna know what's going on
are you gonna tell me?
 are you gonna? 
are you gonna?
 are you gonna? 

are you gonna tell me what i do to you?
can i sit back? relax?
watch the world go by and know that we got it
tell me what i do to you
can i sit back? relax?
watch the world go by and know that we got it
 are you gonna tell me? 
watch the world go by and know that we got it
are you gonna tell me?
watch the world go by and know that we got it


i'm seeming to be glad a lot
i'm happy again, calmer, calm in time
expose your doubter, arm yourself with
me and then ensure your rise

you're the match of jericho
that will burn this whole madhouse down
and i'll throw open like the walnut safe
more like a love that's a bottle of exquisite stuff is

you, yourself, and your father
don't know, so much in your own ways
you're really both bone setters
thank you for mending me babies

you're the match of jericho
that will burn this whole madhouse down
and i'll throw open like a walnut safe
you would seem more like being from that same bottle of exquisite stuff
is, you are the match of jericho that will
burn this whole madhouse down on the floor
open like the walnut safe

you, yourself, and your father don't know
so much in your own ways
you're really both bone setters
thank you for mending me babies

tell me where you've been to
nowhere that you shouldn't do
tell me what you're good for
i can tell you something too
where have you been staying?
tell me what you're playing
hope it's not my conscience
but it keeps complaining
didn't meet you in an alley
the cats they weren't complaining
i met you in the daylight
our visions misbehaving
i offer you my temper
with the hope that you would tame me
we built ourselves a shelter
you will always be my baby
feeling, keep on feeling, keep on feeling

i only wanna be your one life stand  keep on feeling 
tell me do you stand by your man?  keep on feeling 
i only wanna be your one life stand  keep on feeling 
tell me do you stand by your man?  keep on feeling 
wishes keep remaining
nothing worth containing
a balloon with air is escaping
is nothing but a plaything
moments keep us guessing
and lead us from temptation
but better to embrace them
and measure our relation

i only wanna be your one life stand  keep on feeling 
tell me do you stand by your man?  keep on feeling 
i only wanna be your one life stand  keep on feeling 
tell me do you stand by your man?  keep on feeling 

 could this be, could this be? 
i only wanna be your one life stand  keep on feeling 
 could this be, could this be? 
tell me do you stand by your man?  keep on feeling 
 could this be, could this be? 
i only wanna be your one life stand  keep on feeling 
 could this be, could this be? 
tell me do you stand by your man?  keep on feeling 



what's going on? could this be my understanding?
it's not your fault i was being too demanding
i must admit, it's my pride that made me distant
all because i hoped that you'd be someone different

there's not much i know about you
fear will always make you blind
but the answer is in clear view
it's amazing what you'll find face to face

i turned away because i thought you were the problem
tried to forget, until i hit the bottom
but when i faced you in my blank confusion
i realised you weren't wrong, it was a mere illusion

it really didn't make sense
just to leave this unresolved
it's not hard to go the distance
when you finally get involved face to face

it really didn't make sense
just to leave this unresolved
it's not hard to go the distance
when you finally get involved face to face


when i think that i'm over you
i'm overpowered

your data my data
the chromosomes match
exact as in matter
a matter of fact
these amaranth feelings
a cognitive state
need the love object
to reciprocate

when i think that i'm over you
i'm overpowered
it's long overdue
i'm overpowered

i'm overpowered

oxy toxin's flowing ever into my brain

alien feelings
we have to accept

do you feel like a chainstore?
practically floored
one of many zeros
kicked around, bored
your ears are full but you're empty
holding out your heart
to people who never really
care how you are

so give me coffee and tv, easily
i've seen so much, i'm going blind
and i'm braindead virtually
sociability, it's hard enough for me
take me away from this big, bad world
and agree to marry me
so we can start over again

do you go to the country?
it isn't very far
there's people there who will hurt you
because of who you are
your ears are full of the language
there's wisdom there, you're sure
until the words start slurring
and you can't find the door

to see age in a flower
the dawns are speeding up
you know it ll hurt you
feel all of a sudden
tired and teary eyed
you knew it d kill you

don t wear a tie that ll choke you
to death in the city
take it off and forget
spare the fret that ll make you
miss all of summer
sweat it out and forgive

to see loss in a shower
the petals turn to mush
it still disappoints you
then less of a sudden
you wire your weary mind
to let it deceive you

don t force a smile that ll make you
resent the city
play it soft and forgive
keep the frown that ll make you
squint in the summer
play it slow and forget


your needs are covered by me
know that i see you weep
our blood runs deep
your mind could change the game
i won't let you go insane
with severed veins

if you only knew
we won't undo
it's always you
and now you know it's true
me said there's never undo
it's always you

you've been a dark story
but don't let it sink right in
let's just sing
if you got desire to see
a clear idea
we could be the sun down here
we could bring the fun around here

if you only knew
we won't undo
it's always you
and now you know it's true
me said there's never undo
it's always you

if you're tortured in pain
i could be the one
i could stop the rain from falling
no need to be afraid
let me be the one
you and i are the same

and if you only knew
we won't undo
it's always you
and now you know it's true
me said there's never undo
it's always you

to be a victim almost every night

hello, hello
to all the generation
yeah

when i'm falling down
will you pick me up again?
when i'm too far gone
dead in the eyes of my friends
will you take me out of here
when i'm staring down the barrel
when i'm blinded by the lights
when i cannot see your face?
take me out of here
take me out of here
take me out of here
take me out of here

all i believe and all i've known
are being taken from me, can't get home
led to a world where worlds collide
let the fear collapse, bring no surprise
take me out of here

i remember flashbacks lighting up magic whip
eight o'clock, kowloon emptiness, handle it
the white horse image i had of you eleven seconds ago
i didn't send you, so you will never know
i got away for a little while
but then it came back much harder

swinging on a cable up to po lin
climbing panda, ghostly wine, and a battery
that light in your eyes i search for religiously
when it's not there, oh lord, it's hurting me
i got away for a little while
but then it came back much harder

'til i ever hold you out there again, will you be mine?
'cause i'm on a ghost ship drowning my heart in hong kong
it's the last ride boarding here tonight
out in the bay  out in the bay 
i'll need a lantern in you to shine out bright rays

feeling out of body here, what can i do?
it's up to the top every day to join with you
i had to get away for a little while
but then it came back much harder

'til i ever hold you out there again, will you be mine?
'cause i'm on a ghost ship drowning my heart in hong kong
it's the last ride boarding here tonight
out in the bay  out in the bay 
i'll need a lantern in you to shine out bright rays


'til i ever hold you out there again, will you be mine?
'cause i'm on a ghost ship drowning my heart in hong kong
it's the last ride boarding here tonight
out in the bay  out in the bay 
i'll need a lantern in you to shine out bright rays
bright rays, bright rays

the only one i know
has come to take me away
the only one i know
is mine when she stitches me
the only one i see
has found an aching in me
the only one i see
has turned her tongue into me
everyone has been burned before
everybody knows the pain
everyone has been burned before
everybody knows the pain
the only one i know
never cries, never opens her eyes
the only one i know
wide awake and then she's away
the only one i see
is mine when she walks down our street
the only one i see
has carved her way into me
everyone has been burned before
everybody knows the pain
everyone has been burned before
everybody knows the pain
everyone has been burned before
everybody knows the pain
everyone has been burned before
everybody knows the pain


you'll be given love
you'll be taken care of
you'll be given love
you have to trust it

maybe not from the sources
you have poured yours
maybe not from the directions
you are staring at

twist your head around
it's all around you
all is full of love
all around you

all is full of love
you just ain't receiving
all is full of love
your phone is off the hook
all is full of love
your doors are all shut
all is full of love

all is full of love, all is full of love
all is full of love, all is full of love
all is full of love
all is full of love, all is full of love
all is full of love
all is full of love
all is full of love
all is full of love

it was me on that road
but you couldn't see me
too many lights out, but nowhere near here
it was me on that road
still you couldn't see me
and the flashlights and explosions
road's end getting nearer
we cover distance but not together
i am the storm, and i am the wonder
and the flashlights, nightmares, sudden explosions
i don't know what more to ask for
i was given just one wish
it's about you and the sun
a morning run
the story of my maker
what i have and what i ache for
i've got a golden ear
i cut and i spear
and what else is there?
road's end getting nearer
we cover distance still not together
if i am the storm, if i am the wonder
will i have flashlights, nightmares, sudden explosions?
i don't know what more to ask for
i was giving just one wish
road's end getting nearer

there is no room where i can go and
you've got secrets too
i don't know what more to ask for
i was given just one wish

i know

but baby, you and me, we came up from the street
no time to hesitate, we've got to push our weight

put your money on me
'cause i can barely breathe
put your money on me

put your money on me
if you think i'm losing you, you must be crazy
all your money on me
i'm never gonna let you go, even when it's easy
put your money on me
or tuck me into bed, and wake me when i'm dead
i know that you gotta be free
but i'm never gonna let it go

if there was a race, a race for your heart
it started before you were born
above the chloroform sky
clouds made of ambien
sitting on carpets in the basement of heaven
we were born innocent, but it lasts a day
and baby you can give all the money away
but if there's a race, a race for your heart
it's over before it starts
singing

put your money on me
if you think i'm losing you, you must be crazy
all your money on me
i'm never gonna let you go, even when it's easy
put your money on me
or tuck me into bed, and wake me when i'm dead
i know that you gotta be free
but i'm never gonna let it go

all my presents are broken before they're open
and the promises, the second they're spoken
i know i've been different
my skin keeps shedding
my mother was crying on the day of our wedding
trumpets of angels call for my head
i fight through the ether and i'll quit when i'm dead
if you want to know who'll be there in the end
when you bury me, baby, i'll still be your friend
singing

put your money on me
if you think i'm losing you, you must be crazy
all your money on me
i'm never gonna let you go, even when it's easy
put your money on me
or tuck me into bed, and wake me when i'm dead
i know that you gotta be free
but i'm never gonna let it go

singing put your money on
all your money on me
put your money on
i know it's not the last time
put your money on
all your money on
put your money on
i know it's not easy

 to put your money on me 
 'cause i can barely breathe 
 when you put your money on me 
when silicon valley's melted back into silicon
we'll find a way to survive
singing

put your money on me
if you think i'm losing you, you must be crazy
all your money on me
i'm never gonna let you go, even when it's easy
put your money on me
or tuck me into bed, and wake me when i'm dead
i know that you gotta be free
but i'm never gonna let it go

singing put your money on
all your money on me
put your money on
i know it's not the last time
put your money on
all your money on
put your money on
i know it's not easy
to put your money on
all your money on me

well i heard it, playing soft
from a drunken bar's jukebox
and for a moment i was lost
in remembering, what i never forgot
and i never felt guilt about
the trouble that we got into
i just couldn't let that honey hide inside of you
and just because now it's different
doesn't change what it meant
and when i hear that song
you know i'm only gonna
think about one girl
i think about you
when i sing this song
you know i'm only gonna
sing it for one girl
ooh ooh ooh
well i heard it, playing loud
i never knew what it was about
till i fell silent in a crowd
i just turned around and walked straight out
'cause i guess i felt guilty
about the trouble that i caused you
putting myself first, just like i always do
but that doesn't change how i feel
'cause when i hear it, it feels real
and when i hear that song
you know i'm only gonna
think about one boy
i think about you
and when i sing this song
you know i'm only gonna
sing it for one boy
ooh ooh ooh
well, i can't forget
things you said or your kisses
and i keep your secrets
where i keep your promises
but you need my confessions
about as much as you need my lies
and i guess it took that song to make me realize



we are young, we run green
keep our teeth nice and clean
see our friends, see the sights
and feel alright

we wake up, we go out
smoke a fag, put it out
see our friends, see the sights
and feel alright

are we like you?
i can't be sure
of the scene as she turns
we are strange in our worlds

but we are young, we get by
can't go mad, ain't got time
sleep around if we like
but we're alright

got some cash, bought some wheels
took it out 'cross the fields
lost control, hit a wall
but we're alright

are we like you?
i can't be sure
of the scene as she turns
we are strange in our worlds

but we are young, we run green
keep our teeth nice and clean
see our friends, see the sights
and feel alright

are we like you?
i can't be sure
of the scene as she turns
we are strange in our worlds

but we are young, we run green
keep our teeth nice and clean
see our friends, see the sights
and feel alright...

"everybody be cool, this is a robbery "
"any of you fucking pricks move
and i'll execute every motherfucking last one of you "

me and fast got the gats, we're out to rob the bank
we got steve outside carrying a full pack
now everything's cool and everything's smooth
hey that's smooth...
i walked up to the teller, i gave her the letter
she gives me the loot with puckered up lips and a wink
that i found cute and i said, "baby, baby, baby..."
is this some karmic chi love thing happening here baby or what?
by that time fast tapped me with the 9
he said it was time to blow, you know
so out the door we go back to the ride with steve inside
and alive, and off we drive
see, i hurt my lower lumbar, you know we'll never get far
riding around in a stolen police car
so we dropped it off and piled in a caddy
steve was driving because i had to talk to my man about something
"look, i don't know anything about any fucking set up
you can torture me all you want..."
"torture you, that's good, that's a good idea, i like that one."

running around robbing banks
all whacked off of scooby snacks
running around robbing banks
all whacked off of scooby snacks
and i don't give a fuck about the hell's gate
ain't punkin' the crowd and i'm still standing up straight
so, we pull these jobs to make a little money
no one gets hurt if they don't act funny
on the way to the yacht, we almost got caught
fast is shooting mailboxes, not knowing where the cop is, yeah
they're at the dunkin donuts, adjacent from the fromans'
whose mailbox fast had just exploded
they gave chase, but my man steve's an ace
and we lost those brothers with haste
we casted off and along we went
off bermuda to an island resort we rented
"sonny, i need you cool, are you cool?"
"...i am cool."

making sense of what i've heard
and what is on my mind
don't look down cause it's far to fall
count the hours, face the fear
it's haunting me these days
we're past the post and through the door
hail, commercial suicide
kiss the life you left behind
don't let it bother you
you do what it takes to get what you can
last night i thought about
another life and what i'd do
it's hanging over me
i'm sure to break your loving heart
i'm dying to take a walk
down this sugar coated sonic path
cause i've been hanging around for hours
staring at your hologram
outside a northern harbour
digging up the harder times
i might have known that you'd been
tearing up the photographs
standing on your holy ground
lost sight of all i've done
picking round for higher ground
guests out in paradise
with china dolls and better times
the satellite is always overhead
it's watching you
you know it's living hell
i'm solid gone, coming for no one, no one, no one

last night you talked about leaving
i said i can't let you go
it's not just emotional feeling
i need you body and soul
you give me one good reason to leave me
i'll give you ten good reasons to stay
you're the only one i believe in
i'd be hurt, i'd be hurt, if you walk away
too many broken hearts in the world
there's too many dreams can be broken in two
too many broken hearts in the world
so i won't give up the fight for you
the world is full of lonely people
who never held onto love
last night i tried to reach you
but somehow it wasn't enough
so i said, can't you wait a bit longer
i'll give you all that a lover should give
it ain't my pride but my love that is stronger
i'd be hurt; i'd be hurt, if you walk away
too many broken hearts in the world
there's too many dreams can be broken in two
too many broken hearts in the world
so i won't give up the fight for you
too many broken hearts in the world
there's too many dreams can be broken in two
too many broken hearts in the world
so i won't give up the fight for you
you give me one good reason to leave me
i'll give you ten good reasons to stay
you're the only one i believe in
i'd be hurt; i'd be hurt, if you walked away
too many broken hearts in the world
there's too many dreams can be broken in two
too many broken hearts in the world
so i won't give up the fight for you

if you ever get close to a human
and human behavior
be ready, be ready to get confused
there's definitely, definitely, definitely no logic
to human behavior
but yet so, yet so irresistible

and there is no map

they're terribly, terribly, terribly moody
oh, human behavior
then all of a sudden turn happy
but, oh, to get involved in the exchange
of human emotions
is ever so, ever so satisfying

and there is no map

human behavior, human, human
human behavior, human, human
human behavior
human behavior, human, human

and there is no map
and a compass wouldn't help at all

human behavior, human, human
human behavior, human
human behavior, human, human
human behavior, human, human

there's definitely, definitely, definitely no logic
human behaviour, human
human behaviour, human
human behaviour, human

there's definitely, definitely, definitely no logic
human

i must've died and gone to heaven
cos it was a quarter past eleven
on a saturday in 1999
right across from where i'm standing
on the dance floor she was landing
it was clear that she was from another time
like some baby barbarella
with the stars as her umbrella
she asked me if i'd like to magnetize
do i have to go star trekking
cause it's you i should be checking
so she laserbeamed me with her cosmic eyes

she's just a cosmic girl
from another galaxy
my heart's at zero gravity
she's from a cosmic world
putting me in ecstasy
transmitting on my frequency
she's cosmic

i'm scanning all my radars
we'll she said she's from a quasar
forty thousand million light years away
it's a distant solar system
i tried to phone but they don't list 'em
so i asked her for a number all the same
she said, step in my transporter
so i can teleport ya
all around my heavenly body
this could be a close encounter
i should take care not to flounder
sends me into hyperspace, when i see her pretty face

she's just a cosmic girl
from another galaxy
my heart's at zero gravity
she's from a cosmic world
putting me in ecstasy
transmitting on my frequency
she's cosmic

sends me into hyperspace when i see her pretty face
sends me into hyperspace when i see her pretty face
sends me into hyperspace when i see her pretty face

she's just a cosmic girl
from another galaxy
transmitting on my frequency  yeah, cosmic, oh
