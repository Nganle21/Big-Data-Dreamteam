davy says that i look taller
but i can t get my head around it
i keep feeling smaller and smaller
i need my girl

drove the car into the garden?
you got out and said, "i m sorry"
to the vines and no one saw it
i need my girl
i need my girl

i m under the gun again
i know i was a 45 percenter then
i know i was a lot of things

but i am good, i am grounded
davy says that i look taller
but i can t get my head around it
i keep feeling smaller and smaller
i need my girl
i need my girl

there s some things that i should never
laugh about in front of family
i tried to call you from the party
it s full of punks and cannonballers
i need my girl
i need my girl

i m under the gun again
i know i was a 45 percenter then
i know i was a lot of things

but i am good, i am grounded
davy says that i look taller
i can t get my head around it
i keep feeling smaller and smaller
i keep feeling smaller and smaller
i keep feeling smaller and smaller

candle light
아직 잠깐만, are you ready?
내가 신호를 주면
하나 둘 셋 세고 눈을 떠 봐
뭣 때문에 내가 이러는지
넌 궁금해하지만
아무 날도 아닌걸
like monday, tuesday, wednesday, thursday
너와 함께한 순간 내겐 always
매일같이 특별했었으니까
불어 봐 candle light, candle light, candle light baby
함께해 준 모든 날 고맙다는 뜻이야
이럴 땐 왠지 난 왠지 난 왠지 난 baby
쑥스럽긴 하지만 널 사랑한단 뜻이야
환하게 미소 지은 눈부신 널 보니
na na na na na na na
너와 나 영원히 해달란 소원이
다 이뤄질 것 같아 woo
알아 다가올 날들은
너무나 불투명하고
지나간 날은 아쉬워
하지만 더 걱정은 마
오늘과 같은 하루를
하루씩 더해가면 돼 woo
난 monday, tuesday, wednesday, thursday
너로 채워갈 계획만 가득해
이 정도면 좀 완벽할 것 같아
불어봐 candle light, candle, light, candle light baby
함께해 준 모든 날 고맙다는 뜻이야
이럴 땐 왠지 난 왠지 난 왠지 난 baby
쑥스럽긴 하지만 널 사랑한단 뜻이야
환하게 미소 진 눈부신 널 보니

너와 나 영원히 해달란 소원이
다 이뤄질 것 같아 woo
마음속에 네가 있기에 자연스러워 내 멜로디
너로 인해 가능해졌어 나의 꿈들이
이루고 싶어 전부 너와 함께
혼자가 아닌 이제 너와 같이 girl
나 홀로 누군가가 필요할 때 나타나준 너
평범함 속에도 너의 소중함을 celebrate
촛불같이 놓여진 street 불빛들 마저 특별해
늘 내 곁에 있어 줘
자 이제 눈을 떠 눈을 떠 눈을 떠 baby
선물 같은 날들을 네게 주고 싶어서
이렇게 너와 나 너와 나 너와 나 baby
내년 이맘때에도 함께 할 수 있을까
책상 위에 펼친 달력에 한 칸씩
하루도 빠짐없이 오직 you and me
불 꺼지지 않는 candle light같이
너와 나 영원히 해달란 소원이
다 이뤄질 것 같아 woo

happier with what i haven't won
better off for what i haven't done
it'll take all day just to chase the sun
better off for what i haven't done
better off for what i haven't done

the road to heaven goes off a ways
where the streets are paved with them better days
and i don't think about where i'm going
the hopeful rose can have some petty thorns
said the lonely bullet to the smoking gun
i'm better off for what i haven't done
i'm better off for what i haven't done

better off for what i've not become
living dog days with the blinders on
better off for what i haven't got
with a lighter load and a happy heart

i can get along any given day
break your stare by just looking away
'cause that kind of love is a dollar and done
you just gather up your things and run
and i prefer my nights in the sun
i'm better off for what i haven't done
better off for what i haven't done

listen 
the rain is falling on the roses
the fragrance drifts across the garden
like the scent of some forgotten melody
this melody, belongs to you, belongs to me, belongs to no one
see the way the crimson petals scatter when the wind blows
ah  the secret sigh of love that suddenly the heart knows
see now a robin's there among the puddless
and, hopping through the misty rain drops
he's come to tell us it is spring
look at the double rainbow
the rain is silver in the sun light
a fleeting fox is in the garden
rain sweet lovin'mother rain
that soaks the earth
that swells the streams
that cleans the sky
and brings the blue
see how the jasmin tree is all in flower 
the little brook of clever waters flows into a vast
river
ah  you belong to no one...
ah  you belong to no one...
ah  you belong to no one...
ah  you belong to no one...
ah  you belong to no one...

eye to eye stand winners and losers
hurt by envy, cut by greed
face to face with their own disillusions
the scars of old romances still on their cheeks
and when blow by blow
the passion dies sweet little death
just have been lies
some memories of gone by times would still recall the lies
the first cut won't hurt at all
the second only makes you wonder
the third will have you on your knees
you start bleeding i start screaming
it's too late the decision is made by fate
time to prove what forever should last
whose feelings are so true as to stand the test?
whose demands are so strong as to parry all attempts?
and when blow by blow
the passion dies sweet little death
just have been lies
some memories of gone by times will still recall the lies
the first cut won't hurt at all
the second only makes you wonder
the third will have you on your knees
you start bleeding i start screaming
the first cut won't hurt at all
the second only makes you wonder
the third will have you on your knees
you start bleeding i start screaming

i wandered near and far
i wished upon a star
and darling here you are, at last
my guardian angel must have sent you
to find me
now i've left the heartaches, behind me
although the road was long
i thought that i was strong
and now the saddest song is passed
in this big world, full of losers
the beggars can't be choosers
i wished on my star and here you are at last
in this big world, full of losers
the beggars can't be choosers
i wished on my star and here you are at last

heaven on earth, they call it basin street

where the elite always meet
down in new orleans, the land of dreams
you'll never know how nice it seems
or just how much it really means
just to be

the land of dreams
where i can lose
my basin street blues

embrace me, my sweet embraceable you 
embrace me, you irreplaceable you 
just one look at you
my heart grew tipsy in me
you and you alone
bring out the gypsy in me 
i love all, the many charms about you 
above all, i want my arms about you 
don't be a naughty baby
come to papa, come to papa, do 
my sweet embraceable you 

my heart is sad and lonely
for you i sigh, for you dear only
why haven't you seen it
i'm all for you body and soul
i spend my days in longing
and wondering why it's me you're wronging
i tell you i mean it
i'm all for you body and soul
i can't believe it
it's hard to conceive it
that you'd turn away romance
are you pretending
it looks like the ending
unless i could have just one more chance to prove, dear
my life a wreck you're making
you know i'm yours for just the taking
i'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul
my life a wreck you're making
you know i'm yours for the very taking
i'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul

summertime and the livin' is easy
fish are jumpin' and the cotton is fine
oh your daddy's rich and your ma is good lookin'
so hush little baby, don't you cry
one of these mornings
you're goin' to rise up singing
then you'll spread your wings
and you'll take the sky
but till that morning
there's a nothin' can harm you
with daddy and mammy standin' by





it's not the pale moon that excites me
that thrills and delights me
oh no, it's just the nearness of you
isn't your sweet conversation
that brings me this sensation
oh no, it's just the nearness of you
when i'm in your arms
and i feel you so close to me
all my wondrous dreams come true
i need no soft lights to enchant me
if you only grant me the right
to hold you ever so tight
and to feel in the night
the nearness of you

listen 
the rain is falling on the roses
the fragrance drifts across the garden
like the scent of some forgotten melody
this melody, belongs to you, belongs to me, belongs to no one
see the way the crimson petals scatter when the wind blows
ah  the secret sigh of love that suddenly the heart knows
see now a robin's there among the puddless
and, hopping through the misty rain drops
he's come to tell us it is spring
look at the double rainbow
the rain is silver in the sun light
a fleeting fox is in the garden
rain sweet lovin'mother rain
that soaks the earth
that swells the streams
that cleans the sky
and brings the blue
see how the jasmin tree is all in flower 
the little brook of clever waters flows into a vast
river
ah  you belong to no one...
ah  you belong to no one...
ah  you belong to no one...
ah  you belong to no one...
ah  you belong to no one...

the falling leaves drift by the window
the autumn leaves of red and gold
i see your lips, the summer kisses
the sun burned hands i used to hold
since you went away the days grow long
and soon i'll hear old winter's song
but i miss you most of all my darling
when autumn leaves start to fall
c'est une chanson, qui nous ressemble
toi tu m'aimais et je t'aimais
nous vivions tous deux ensemble
toi qui m'aimais moi qui t'aimais
mais la vie separe ceux qui s'aiment
tout doucement sans faire de bruit
et la mer efface sur le sable les pas des amants desunis
