

you got hell to pay, but you already sold your soul
it s blasphemy, but the words don t make sense no more
what would your mother say? your faith has you immured
so, don t try and tell me that you still believe
no, don t preach to me

ask no questions and you ll get no lies
turn the cheek and blind the eye
let it go 
bend the knee and give away your life
bite your tongue and close your mind
never know 

 cause you got hell to pay, but you already sold your soul
it s blasphemy, but the words don t make sense no more
what would your mother say? your faith has you immured
so, don t try and tell me that you still believe
no, don t preach to me

you re not blessed, you re cursed
and it s getting worse now

it makes no sense, but it must be right
the blood and sweat you sacrificed
was it all  for nothing
 cause we ve found no sign and we ve seen no light
we hear no voice when we pray at night
but we swore  and now it s too late to turn back


you re not blessed, you re cursed
and it s getting worse now

you got hell to pay, but you already sold your soul
it s blasphemy, but the words don t make sense no more
what would your mother say? your faith has you immured
so, don t try and tell me that you still believe
no, don t preach to me

no, don t preach to me
don t preach to me  you re not blessed, you re cursed 
no, don t preach to me  and it s getting worse now 
it s blasphemy


scream, with your hands up in the sky
like you want to testify
for the life that's been deleted
sing, like a rebel's lullaby
under the stars and stripes
for the lost souls that were cheated
we will be seen but not be heard

we are revolution radio
operation 'no control'
and the headline 'my love's bullet proof'
give me cherry bombs and gasoline
debutantes in surgery
and the headline 'legalize the truth'

give me rage, like there s tear gas in the crowd
do you wanna live out loud?
but the air is barely breathing
rise of the slums to the obsolete
the dawn of the new airwaves for the anti social media

we are revolution radio
operation 'no control'
and the headline 'my love's bullet proof'
give me cherry bombs and gasoline
debutantes in surgery
and the headline 'legalize the truth'

we will be seen but not be heard
we are the songs of the disturbed

we are revolution radio
operation 'no control'
and the headline 'my love's bullet proof'
give me cherry bombs and gasoline
debutantes in surgery
and the headline 'legalize the truth'


why don't you ask the kids at tienanmen square?
was fashion the reason why they were there?
they disguise it, hypnotize it
television made you buy it

i'm just sitting in my car and waiting for my

she's scared that i will take her away from there
her dreams that her country left with no one there
mesmerized the simple minded
propaganda leaves us blinded

i'm just sitting in my car and waiting for my girl
i'm just sitting in my car and waiting for my girl


i'm just sitting in my car and waiting for my girl
i'm just sitting in my car and waiting for my... girl


millionaire say, got a big shot deal
and thrown it all away, but
but i'm not too sure how i'm supposed to feel
or what i'm supposed to say, but

i'm not, not sure
not too sure how it feels
to handle everyday

and i miss you, love

make room for the prey
'cause i'm coming in with what i want to say, but
it's gonna hurt
and i love the pain
a breeding ground for hate, but

i'm not, not sure
not too sure how it feels
to handle every day
like the one that just passed
in the crowds of all the people

remember today
i've no respect for you

and i miss you, love
and i miss you, love

i love the way you love
but i hate the way i'm supposed to love you back
and it's just a fad part of the teen, teenage angst brigade, and

i'm not, not sure
not too sure how it feels
to handle every day
like the one that just passed
in the crowds of all the people

remember today
i've no respect for you

and i miss you, love
and i miss you, love

remember today
i've no respect for you

and i miss you, love
and i miss you

i love the way you love
but i hate the way i'm supposed to love you back


sleeping very soundly on a saturday morning
i was dreaming i was al capone
rumors going round, got to clear out of town
smell like a dry fishbone
here come the law, going to break down the door
carry me away once more
never, never, never want it anymore
got to get away from this stone cold floor
crazy, stone cold crazy, you know

rainy afternoon, ought to kill a typhoon
and she is playing on my slide trombone
anymore, anymore, cannot take it anymore
gotta get away from this stone cold floor
crazy, stone cold crazy, you know

walking down the street, shooting people that i meet
fully loaded tommy gun
here come the deputy, try fucking getting me
gotta fucking get up and run
they got the sirens loose, i ran right out of juice
they are going to put me in a cell
if i can't go to heaven, let me go to hell
crazy, stone cold crazy, you know


i wish i could eat the salt off of your lost faded lips
we can cap the old times, make playing only logical harm
we can cap the old lines, make playing that nothing else will change

but she can read, she can read, she can read, she can read, she's bad
she can read, she can read, she can read, she's bad
oh, she's bad

but it's different now that i'm poor and aging
i'll never see this face again
you go stabbing yourself in the neck

and we can find new ways of living
make playing only logical harm
and we can top the old times
clay making that nothing else will change

but she can read, she can read, she can read, she can read, she's bad
she can read, she can read, she can read, she's bad
oh, she's bad

but it's different now that i'm poor and aging
i'll never see this face again
you go stabbing yourself in the neck
but it's different now that i'm poor and aging
i'll never see this face again
you go stabbing yourself in the neck

it's in the way that she posed
it's in the things that she puts in my head
her stories are boring and stuff
she's always calling my bluff
she puts the, she puts the weights into my little heart
and she gets in my room and she takes it apart
she puts the weights into my little heart
i said she puts the weights into my little heart
she puts the weight, she puts the weight
she puts the weight, she puts the weight
she puts the weight, she puts the weight
she puts the weight, she puts the weight

it's in the way that she walks
her heaven is never enough
she puts the weights in my heart
she puts, oh she puts the weights into my little heart

pray for blood
pray for the cleansing
pray for the flood
pray for the end of this nightmare
this lie of a life can, as quickly as it came, dissolve
we seek only reprieve and welcome the darkness
the myth of a meaning so lost and forgotten  forgotten 
take hold of my hand
for you are no longer alone
walk with me in hell
pray for solace
pray for resolve
pray for a savior
pray for deliverance, some kind of purpose
a glimpse of a light in this void of existence
now witness the end of an age
hope dies in hands of believers
who seek the truth in the liar's eye
take hold of my hand
for you are no longer alone
walk with me in hell
walk with me in hell 
take hold of my hand
for you are no longer alone
walk with me in hell 
you're never alone 
walk with me in hell


me and magdalena
we're driving south through monterey
as the sun is slowly sinking
into a distant ocean wave

and i don't know if i've ever loved any other
half as much as i do in this light she's under

tell me magdalena
what do you see in the depths of your night?
do you see a long lost father?
does he hold you with the hands you remember as a child?

but know everything lost will be recovered
when you drift into the arms of the undiscovered
and i don't know if i've ever loved any other
half as much as i do in this light she's under

me and magdalena
always leaving early and sleeping late
secluded in the canyon
lost within a turn of fate

but know everything lost will be recovered
when you drift into the arms of the undiscovered
and i don't know if i've ever loved any other
half as much as i do in this light she's under


today is gonna be the day that they're gonna throw it back to you
by now, you should have somehow realised what you gotta do
i don't believe that anybody feels the way i do, about you now

backbeat, the word is on the street that the fire in your heart is out
i'm sure you've heard it all before but you never really had a doubt
i don't believe that anybody feels the way i do, about you now

and all the roads we have to walk are winding
and all the lights that lead us there are blinding
there are many things that i would like to say to you
but i don't know how

because maybe
you're gonna be the one that saves me
and after all
you're my wonderwall

today was gonna be the day but they'll never throw it back to you
by now you should've somehow realised what you're not to do
i don't believe that anybody feels the way i do, about you now

and all the lights that light the way are blinding
there are many things that i would like to say to you
but i don't know how

you're gonna be the one that saves me
and after all
you're my wonderwall

bodies, can't you see what everybody wants from you?

forgive the kids
for they don't know how to live
run the alleys, casually

cruel, cruel

bodies, can't you see what everybody wants from you?
if you could want that, too

they could take or leave you
so they took you and they left you
how could they be casually

cruel, cruel, oh hoh
cruel, cruel, oh hoh

bodies, can't you see what everybody wants from you?
if you could want that, too, then you'll be happy

you were the one waving flares in the air
so they could see you
and they were the zephyr blowing past you
blowing fastly so they can t see you
 2x 

the only one i know
has come to take me away
the only one i know
is mine when she stitches me
the only one i see
has found an aching in me
the only one i see
has turned her tongue into me
everyone has been burned before
everybody knows the pain
everyone has been burned before
everybody knows the pain
the only one i know
never cries, never opens her eyes
the only one i know
wide awake and then she's away
the only one i see
is mine when she walks down our street
the only one i see
has carved her way into me
everyone has been burned before
everybody knows the pain
everyone has been burned before
everybody knows the pain
everyone has been burned before
everybody knows the pain
everyone has been burned before
everybody knows the pain

instrumental


wasting on nothing
effortlessly, you appear
sound of the thunder
reverberate in your ears
this is a slow dance
this is the chance to transform
pause for the silence
inhabit the calm of the storm

this is your ocean, an ocean of night
this is the notion, your ocean of night
this is your ocean, an ocean of night
this is the notion, your ocean of night

love is a feeling
buried with me in the yard
gaze at the skyline
under the ocean of stars
this is your slow dance
and this is your chance to transform
lost to a moment
the moment you confront the storm

this is your ocean, an ocean of night
this is the notion, your ocean of night
this is your ocean, an ocean of night
this is the notion, your ocean of night
uh uhh..

suddenly, the day turns into night
far away from the city

don't hesitate
'cause your love won't wait

ooh, baby, i love your way

of freddy's hand
nightmare on elm street

nightmare on elm street
where no one can hear me scream
a bastard son of 1000 maniacs
locks us inside his hell

wild boys, wild boys, wild boys
wild boys
wild  boys 

the wild boys are calling
on their way back from the fire
in august moon's surrender to
a dust cloud on the rise
wild boys fallen far from glory
reckless and so hungered
on the razors edge you trail
because there's murder by the roadside
in a sore afraid new world

they tried to break us
looks like they'll try again

wild boys never lose it
wild boys never chose this way
wild boys never close your eyes
wild boys always shine

you got sirens for a welcome
there's bloodstain for your pain
and your telephone been ringing while
you're dancing in the rain
wild boys wonder where is glory
where is all you angels
now the figureheads have fell
and lovers war with arrows over
secrets they could tell
pre chorus
they tried to tame you
looks like they'll try again

wild boys never lose it
wild boys never chose this way
wild boys never close your eyes
wild boys always shine

wild boys, wild boys, wild boys
wild boys, wild boys, wild boys

wild boys never lose it
wild boys never chose this way
wild boys never close your eyes
wild boys always

wild boys never lose it
wild boys never chose this way
wild boys never close your eyes
wild boys always

wild boys never lose it
wild boys never chose this way
wild boys never close your eyes
wild boys always, wild boys

i've been waiting on the fault line
living evil take me on
i'll be standing with my dying bed
if you care to come along
racing with the rising tide to my father's door
racing with the rising tide to my father's door
i've been lying in the bright light
see my shadow from below
never wanted from another man
never wanted for my own
drowning in the rising tide at my father's door
drowning in the rising tide at my father's door
through a window to the last mile
my living picture on the wall
from the banks on the far side
see the lights come ashore
racing from the rising tide to my father's door
racing from the rising tide to my father's door
racing with the rising tide to my father's door

kiss me
kiss me the way my mouth kissed you
give me the frenzy
that my madness gave you
who if not i
could teach you the road to love
my pride died
when it tumbled
at your feet
i want you to live just for me
and go where i go
so that my soul belongs only to you
kiss me with a frenzy
give me the light of your gaze
and the trembling of your lips
that madness of living and loving
that is more a frenzy than love
in the kiss that i gave you there is
soul, piety, heart
tell me that you know how to feel
the same way i feel
i want you to live just for me
and go where i go
so that my soul belongs only to you
kiss me with a frenzy

whoever appeals to the law against his fellow man is either a fool or a coward
whoever cannot take care of himself without that law is both
for a wounded man shall say to his assailant
'if i live, i will kill you. if i die, you are forgiven.'
such is the rule of honor
broken the paradigm an example must be set
invoke the siren's song and sign the death warrant
this is what has been wrought for 30 pieces of silver
the tongues of men and angels bought by a beloved betrayer
i am the result what's better left unspoken
violence begins to mend what was broken
you've been talking, i've been all ears
words meant to dwell in darkness shall never see the light of day
words can be broken, so can bones
execute the mandate
mouth full of dirt
your name is removed from the registry
st. peter greets with empty eyes then turns and locks the gate
i am the result what's better left unspoken
violence begins to mend what was broken
you've been talking, i've been all ears
omerta
cheaply venal, stupidly verbose
a slip of the tongue, a slit of the throat
six feet under with no marker
keep my name from your mouth forever
free speech for the living, dead men tell no tales
your laughing finger will never point again
omerta
sing for me now


everybody sees me, but it's not that easy
standing in the light field, standing in the light field
waiting for some action, waiting for some action over
why won't you come over here?
why won't you come over here?
we got a city to love
why won't you come over here?
we got a city to love

old time grudges will die so slowly
i know you miss the way i saw you

you're cold, you're so cold
you're so cold, you're so cold

nobody can see me, everything's too easy
standing in the light field, standing in the light field
waiting for some actress, waiting for some actress to say
"why won't you come over here?"
why won't you come over here?
we got a city to love
why won't you come over here?
we got a city to love

old time love song will die so swiftly
you never trust me, for a while it was nice, but it's time to say bye

i'm cold, you're so cold
you're so cold, you're so cold
no no no, cold, you're so cold
you're so cold, you're so cold
oh no no no no, cold, you're so cold
you're so cold, you're so cold
no, no, you're so cold


please allow me to introduce myself
i'm a man of wealth and taste
i've been around for a long, long year
stole many a man's soul to waste
and i was 'round when jesus christ
had his moment of doubt and pain
made damn sure that pilate washed his hands and sealed his fate

pleased to meet you
hope you guess my name
but what's confusing you
is just the nature of my game

i stuck around st. petersburg
when i saw it was a time for a change
i killed the tsar and his ministers, anastasia screamed in vain
i rode a tank, held a general's rank
when the blitzkrieg raged and the bodies stank

pleased to meet you
hope you guess my name
cause what's puzzling you
is the nature of my game
 come on  x3

pleased to meet you
hope you guess my name
ah yeah, but what's confusing you
is the nature of my game

i watched with glee while your kings and queens
fought for ten decades for the gods they made
i shouted out, who killed the kennedys ?
when after all, it was you and me
let me, please introduce myself
i'm a man of wealth and taste
and i laid traps for the troubadours
who get killed before they reached bombay

pleased to meet you
hope you guessed my name, oh yeah
but what's confusing you
it's just the nature of my game

just as every cop is a criminal and all the sinners saints
as heads is tails, just call me lucifer
cause i'm in need of some restraint
so if you meet me, have some courtesy
have some sympathy and some taste
use all your well learned politeness or i'll lay your soul to waste
oh yeah

pleased to meet you
hope you guessed my name, ohh yeah
but what's puzzling you
is just the nature of my game
ah yeah, get down

what's my name?
what's my name?
lucifer, that's my name baby 
oh yeah
oh yeah
oh yeah


it's early morning, the sun comes out
last night was shaking and pretty loud
my cat is purring, it scratches my skin
so what is wrong with another sin?
the bitch is hungry, she needs to tell
so give her inches and feed her well
more days to come, new places to go
i've got to leave, it's time for a show

here i am
rock you like a hurricane
here i am
rock you like a hurricane

my body is burning, it starts to shout
desire is coming, it breaks out loud
lust is in cages 'til storm breaks loose
just have to make it with someone i choose
the night is calling, i have to go
the wolf is hungry, he runs the show
he's licking his lips, he's ready to win
on the hunt tonight for love at first sting

here i am
rock you like a hurricane
here i am
rock you like a hurricane
here i am
rock you like a hurricane
here i am
rock you like a hurricane
rock you like a hurricane

it's early morning, the sun comes out
last night was shaking and pretty loud
my cat is purring, it scratches my skin

he's licking his lips, he's ready to win

here i am
rock you like a hurricane
here i am
rock you like a hurricane
here i am
rock you like a hurricane
here i am

if i could make a wish
i think i'd pass
can't think of anythin i need
no cigarettes, no sleep, no light, no sound
nothing to eat, no books to read
making love with you
has left me peaceful, warm, and tired
what more could i ask
there's nothing left to be desired
peace came upon me and it leaves me weak
so sleep, silent angel
go to sleep
sometimes, all i need is the air that i breathe
and to love you
all i need is the air that i breathe
yes to love you
all i need is the air that i breathe
peace came upon me
and it leaves me weak
so sleep, silent angel
go to sleep
sometimes, all i need is the air that i breathe
and to love you
all i need is the air that i breathe
yes to love you
all i need is the air that i breathe
sometimes, all i need is the air that i breathe
and to love you
all i need is the air that i breathe
yes to love you
all i need is the air that i breathe
and to love you
all i need is the air that i breathe
yes to love you

[verse 1

come waste your millions here
secretly, she sneers
another corporate show
a guilty conscience grows
i'll feel a guilty conscience grow
i'll feel a guilty conscience grow

she burns like the sun
and i can't look away
and she'll burn our horizons
make no mistake

come let the truth be shared
no one ever dared
to break these endless lies
secretly she cries

she burns like the sun
and i can't look away
and she'll burn our horizons
make no mistake

and i'll hide from the world
behind a broken frame
and i'll run forever
i can't face the shame
and i'll hide from the world
behind a broken frame
and i'll run forever
i can't face the shame

i was born on the cemetery
under the sign of the moon
raised from my grave, by the dead
i was made a mercenary
in the legions of hell
now i'm king of pain, i'm insane

you know, my only pleasure
is to hear you cry
i'd love, to hear you cry
i'd love, to feel you die
and i'll be the first
to watch your funeral
and i'll be the last, to leave
i'd love, to hear you cry

and when you're down, beyond the ground
i'll dig up your body again
and make love to shame
oh lady cry, and say goodbye
oh lady cry, and say goodbye
you've gotta say goodbye
'cause i will eat your mind

throw it all away
let's lose ourselves
cause there's no one left for us to blame
it's a shame we're all dying
and do you think you deserve your freedom?
how could you send us so far away from home
when you know damn well that this is wrong?
i will still lay down my life for you
and do you think you deserve your freedom?
no, i don't think you do
there's no justice in the world
there's no justice in the world, and there never was


this healthy, unhealthy voice
sits lennon for you
your healthy, unhealthy voices
it's several for me

now who wants to live the soul's desire
way down we're born to realize
one sobering thought was forced upon
we shall know, we'll know

these slivers that warn our feet
reminders joining us
to the rest, to the worst, the worst is yet to come
to the rest, all the best, the best is yet to come

now who wants to live the soul's desire
way down we're born to realize
one sobering thought was forced upon
we shall know, we'll know

a silent stare brings the creeping clone
won't feel you walking in but feel you walking out
your silent stare brings us closer still
and all her wants out
keep biting in

now who wants to live the soul's desire
way down we're born to realize
one sobering thought was forced upon
we shall know, we'll know


walk you to the counter
what you got to offer
pick you out a soda
look at you forever
walk you to the water
eyes like a casino
you ain't born typical
find a piece of silver
pretty as a diagram
go down to the rio
put it in my left hand
put it in a fruit machine
everyone's a winner
laughing like a seagull

you are a fever, you are a fever
you ain't born typical
you are a fever, you are a fever
you ain't born typical

living in a suitcase
meet a clown and fall in love
been dying to have you over
clown around and break up
take you to a jukebox
that's the situation
pick you out a number
that's our arrangement
dancing on the legs of a new born pony
left right left right, keep it up son
go ahead and have her, go ahead and leave her
you only ever had her when you were a fever

i am a fever, i am a fever
i ain't born typical
i am a fever, i am a fever
i ain't born typical
we are a fever, we are a fever
we ain't born typical

you got a fast car
i want a ticket to anywhere
maybe we make a deal
maybe together we can get somewhere
any place is better
starting from zero got nothing to lose
maybe we'll make something
me myself i got nothing to prove

you got a fast car
i got a plan to get us outta here
i been working at the convenience store
managed to save just a little bit of money
won't have to drive too far
just 'cross the border and into the city
you and i can both get jobs
finally see what it means to be living

see my old man's got a problem
he lives with a bottle that's the way it is
he says his body's too old for working
his body's too young to looking like his
when momma went off and left him
she wanted more from life than he could give
said somebody's gotta take care of him
so i quit school and that's what i did

you got a fast car
is it fast enough so we can fly away?
we gotta make a decision
leave tonight or live and die this way

so i remember when we were driving
driving in your car
speed so fast it felt like i was drunk
city lights lay out before us
and your arms felt nice wrapped around my shoulders and
i i had a feeling that i belonged
i i had a feeling i could be someone, be someone, be someone

you got a fast car
we go cruising to entertain ourselves
you still ain't got a job
i work in a market as a checkout girl
i know things will get better
you'll find work and i'll get promoted
we'll move out of the shelter
buy a bigger house and live in the suburbs

so i remember when we were driving
driving in your car
speed so fast it felt like i was drunk
city lights lay out before us
and your arms felt nice wrapped around my shoulders and
i i had a feeling that i belonged
i i had a feeling i could be someone, be someone, be someone

you got a fast car
i've got a job that pays all our bills
you stay out drinking late at the bars
see more your friends than you do your kids
i always hoped for better
that maybe together you and me would find it
i got no plans i ain't going nowhere
so take your fast car and keep on driving

so remember when we were driving
driving in your car
speed so fast it felt like i was drunk
city lights lay out before us
and your arms felt nice wrapped around my shoulders and
i i had a feeling that i belonged
i i had a feeling i could be someone, be someone, be someone

you got a fast car
is it fast enough so you can fly away?
you gotta make a decision
leave tonight or live and die this way


oh how is it that i could come out to here and be still floating
and never hit bottom and keep falling through
just relaxed and paying attention
all my two dimensional boundaries were gone
i had lost to them badly
i saw the world crumble and thought i was dead
but i found my senses still working
and as i continued to drop thru the hole
i found all the surrounding
who showed me the joy that innocently is
just be quiet and feel it around you
and i opened my heart to the whole universe
and i found it was loving
and i saw the great blunder my teacher's had made
scientific delirium madness
i will keep falling as long as i live
all without ending
and i will remember the place that is now
that has ended before the beginning
oh how is it that i could come out to here and be still floating
and never hit bottom and keep falling through
just relaxed and paying attention

they paved paradise and put up a parking lot
with a pink hotel, a boutique, and a swingin' hot spot

don't it always seem to go
that you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone?
they paved paradise, put up a parking lot
 shoo bop bop bop bop
shoo bop bop bop bop 

they took all the trees, put 'em in a tree museum
and they charged the people a dollar and a half just to see 'em

don't it always seem to go
that you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone?

give me spots on my apples

and a big yellow taxi took away my old man

i woke up on champs  lys es to the djembe of ghana
where a fine lady from belize said "you got the spirit of fela"
a young one dripping make up put her hands out to holla
well, i gave her what i got but couldn't handle her broken heart
the right words in the hands of dissidents with the fire
will rip apart the marrow from the bone of the liars
and well, i'm afraid of saying too much and ending a martyr
even more so i'm afraid to face god and say i was a coward, yeah

with all these things i wait for revelation
these things make me want to duck for cover
with all these things i wait for revolution
these things ask the biggest question to me
and it's are you what you want to be
so are you what you want to be?

the war machine will put out both its hands for a dollar
it's drinking at the table with the chrome hand guerrillas
the young ones dripping make up lift her leg up to holla
well, i told her what she's got should be protected in the arms of love
the right things in the hands of dissidents with the fire
will rip apart the marrow from the bone of the liars
well i'm afraid of saying too much and ending a martyr
but even more so i'm afraid to face god and say i was a coward, yeah

with all these things i wait for revelation
these things make me want to duck for cover
with all these things i wait for revolution

are you what you want to be?
are you what you want to be?

sock it to me...
floatin' down the river
with a saturated liver
and i wish i could forgive her
but i do believe she meant it
when she told me to forget it
and i bet she will regret it
when they find me in the morning wet and drowned
and the word gets 'round
goin' down
goin' down
coming' up for air
it's pretty stuffy under there
i'd like to say i didn't care
but i forgot to leave a note
and it's so hard to stay afloat
i'm soakin' wet without a boat
and i knew i should have taken off my shoes
it's front page news
goin' down
goin' down
i wish i had another drink
it wouldn't be so hard to sink
i should have taken time to think
besides i got the picture straight
she must have had another date
i didn't need this extra weight
i wish that i could see the way to shore
don't want no more
goin' down
i'm goin' down
and now i see the life i led
i slept it all away in bed
i should have learned to swim instead
and now it's really got me stumped
i can't believe why i jumped
i'd like to get my tummy pumped
i can't believe they drink this stuff in town
this dirty brown
goin' down
goin' down
i wish i looked before i leaped
i didn't know it was so deep
been down so far i don't get wet
haven't touched the bottom yet
this river scene is gettin' old
i'm hungry, sleepy, wet and cold
she told me to forget it nice
i should have taken her advice
i only want to go on home
i'd gladly leave that girl alone
what a way to spend the night
if i don't drown, i'll die of fright
my pappy taught me how to float
but i can't swim a single note
he threw me in to teach me how
i stayed there floatin' like a mama cow
and now i've floated way down stream
i know this has to be a dream
if i could find my way to shore
i'd never, never do this anymore
i'll give you three, i've been down nine
i'm goin' down just one more time
goin' down
goin' down
now the sky is gettin' light
an everything will be alright
think i finally got the knack
just floatin' here lazy on my back
i never really liked that town
i think i'll ride the river down
just movin' slow and floatin' free
there's a river swingin' under me
waving back to the folks on shore
i should have thought of this before
i'm floatin' on down to new orleans
goin' to pick up on some swingin' scenes
i know i'll know a better day
i'll go down groovin' all the way
goin' down
goin' down

beware the bottled thoughts of angry young men
secret compartments hide all of the skeletons
little girl wants to make her home with him
in the middle of the shore, she wonders
"don't know what you asked for"
"don't know what you asked for"
all young lovers know why
nightmares blind their mind's eye
your rube is young and handsome
so new to your bedroom floor
you know damn well where you'll go
i've loved so many times and i've drowned them all
from their coral graves, they rise up when darkness falls
with their bones they'll scratch the window
i hear them call
"don't know what you asked for"
"don't know what you asked for"
"don't know what you asked for"
all young lovers know why
nightmares blind their mind's eye
your rube is young and handsome
so new to your bedroom floor
you know damn well where you'll go
stay with me under these waves, tonight
be free for once in your life, tonight
your rube is young and handsome
so new to your bedroom floor
you know damn well where you'll go
all young lovers know why
nightmares blind their mind's eye
your rube is young and handsome
so new to your bedroom floor
you know damn well where you'll go
all young lovers know why
nightmares blind their mind's eye
your rube is young and handsome
so new to your bedroom floor
you know damn well where you will go
ah. ah. ah

sunsets on the nations
worlds in her disguise
pray for all that matters
saviour in my eyes
children of the sun
dying one by one
eden has been wasted
deadly poison fills the air
kneel down in forgiveness
while there's still time if you care
children of the sun
dying one by one
children of the sun
dying one by one
i couldn't dream
to be without her kind
they wouldn't let her be
or heal what she defiled
you are the hate that beats mankind
torturous lies that lead the blind
squandered the truth from all we said
you are the reason i feel dead
mountains start to crumble
tumble in the sea
children of the sun
dying one by one
children of the sun
dying one by one
children of the sun
dying one by one
children of the sun
dying one by one

and this is for the questions that don't have an answer
the midnight glancers, and the topless dancers
the can of freaks, cars packed with speakers
the g's with the forty's and the chicks with beepers
the northern lights and the southern comfort
and it don't even matter if your veins are punctured
all the crackheads, the critics, the cynics
and all my heroes at the methadone clinics
all you bastards at the i.r.s
for the crooked cops and the cluttered desks
for the shots of jack and the caps of meth
half pints of love and a fifth of stress
all the hookers that are tricking out in hollywood
and for my hoods of the world misunderstood
i said it's all good and it's all in fun
now get in the pit and try to love someone


for the time bombs ticking and the heads they hang
all the gangs gettin' money and the heads they bang   bang
wild mustangs, the porno flicks
all my homies in the county in cell block six
the grits when there ain't enough eggs to cook
and to d.b. cooper and the money he took
you can look for answers but that ain't fun
now get in the pit and try to love someone



cowboy
cowboy

where real women come equipped with scripts and fake breasts
find a nest in the hills, chill like flynt
buy an old drop top find a spot to pimp
and i'mma kid rock it up and down ya' block
with a bottle of scotch and watch lots a crotch
buy a yacht with a flag sayin' "chillin' the most"
then rock that bitch up and down the coast
give a toast to the sun, drink with the stars
get thrown in the mix and get tossed outta bars
sip the tiajuana, i want to roam
find motown, tell them fools to come back home
start an escort service for all the right reasons
and set up shop at the top of four seasons
kid rock and i'm the real mccoy
and i'm headed out west sucker because i want to be a

cowboy, baby

i want to be a cowboy, baby 
ride at night cause i sleep all day 
cowboy, baby 
i can smell a pig from a mile away

i bet you'll hear my whistle blowin when my train rolls in
it goes  whistling , like dust in the wind
stoned pimp, stoned freak, stoned out of my mind
i once was lost but now i'm just blind
palm trees and weeds, scabbed knees and rice
get a map to the stars, find heidi fleiss
and if the price is right then i'm gonna make my bid boy
and let cali for ni a know why they call me


yeah 
kid rock you can call me tex
rollin' sunset woman with a bottle of beck's
seen a slimmy in a 'vette, rolled down my glass
and said "yeah this dick fits right in your ass"
no kiddin', gun slingin', spurs hittin' the floor
call me hoss, i'm the boss with the sauce and the whores
no remorse for the sheriff, in his eye i ain't right
i'ma paint his town red then paint his wife white
cause chaos rock like amedeus
find west coast pussy for my detroit playas
mack like mayors ball like lakers
they told us to leave but bet they can't make us
why they wanna pick on me
lock me up and snort away my key
i ain't no g, i'm just a regular failure
i ain't straight outta compton, i'm straight out the trailer
cuss like a sailor, drink like a mick
my only words of wisdom are just suck my dick
i'm flickin' my bic up and down that coast and
keep on truckin' till i fall in the ocean



in the suburbs, i, i learned to drive
and you told me we'd never survive
grab your mother's keys, we're leaving
you always seemed so sure
that one day we'd be fighting in a suburban war
your part of town against mine
i saw you standing on the opposite shore
but by the time the first bombs fell
we were already bored
we were already, already bored

sometimes i can't believe it
i'm moving past the feeling
sometimes i can't believe it
i'm moving past the feeling again

the kids want to be so hard
but in my dreams, we're still screaming
and running through the yard
and all of the walls that they built in the seventies finally fall
and all of the houses they built in the seventies finally fall
meant nothing at all
meant nothing at all, it meant nothing

sometimes i can't believe it
i'm moving past the feeling
sometimes i can't believe it
i'm moving past the feeling and into the night

so can you understand
why i want a daughter while i'm still young?
i want to hold her hand
and show her some beauty before this damage is done
but if it's too much to ask, if it's too much to ask
then send me a son
under the overpass
in the parking lot we're still waiting, it's already passed
so move your feet from hot pavement and into the grass
'cause it's already passed
it's already, already passed

sometimes i can't believe it
i'm moving past the feeling
sometimes i can't believe it
i'm moving past the feeling again
i'm moving past the feeling
i'm moving past the feeling

in my dreams we're still screaming
we're still screaming
we're still screaming


kill me if you dare
hold my head up everywhere
keep myself right on this train
i'm the underdog
live my life on a lullaby
keep myself riding on this train
keep myself riding on this train

love in technicolor, sprayed out on walls
well i've been pounding at the pavement
'til there's nothing at all
i got my cloak and dagger
in a bar room brawl
see the local loves a fighter
loves a winner to fall

feels like i'm lost in a moment
i'm always losing to win
can't get away from the moment
seems like it's time to begin

kill me if you dare
hold my head up everywhere
keep myself right on this train
i'm the underdog
live my life on a lullaby
keep myself riding on this train
keep myself riding on this train

it don't matter
i won't do what you say
you've got the money and the power
i won't go your way
i can't take for the people
they don't matter at all
and i'll be waiting in the shadows
'til the day that you fall

feels like i'm lost in a moment
i'm always losing to win
can't get away from the moment
seems like it's time  to begin

kill me if you dare
hold my head up everywhere
keep myself right on this train
i'm the underdog
live my life on a lullaby
keep myself riding on this train

tell me if you're down
throw your weapons to the ground
keep myself right on this train
paper on the wire
sold your soul for another one
keep myself riding on this train
keep myself riding on this train


another friday night of agitation
so many people but no conversation
all the bands they know
and they're so outgoing

buy your tickets for the execution
the kids are lines up for a prosecution
and they've hung us all
on their bedroom walls

and as entertaining as it is
give up the freak show binge
and rest

oh now, undertaker
looks like we're getting out to explore
death pop, music maker
filling hades left to right

oh now, undertaker

i've never seen so many pale males
but i'm the dullest in this fairytale
in my khaki crown
and colourless gown

innocent and happy smiles
so amused and so unaware
of death

oh now, undertaker
looks like we're getting out to explore

finer worlds that you uncover
plant the path you want to roam
live where your heart can be given
and your life starts to unfold

you think you can't, you wish you could
i know you can, i wish you would
so trip inside this house as you pass by
trip inside this house as you pass by

if your limbs begin dissolving
in the water that you tread
all surroundings are evolving
in the stream that clears your head

come disciples to thee unending
subtleties of rhythm power
so trip inside this house as you pass by
trip inside this house as you pass by

trip, trip, trip inside
trip, trip, trip inside

sweep the shadows from your eyes
sweep the realm of dark aside
so trip inside this house as you pass by
trip inside this house as you pass by

trip, trip, trip inside
trip, trip, trip inside
trip, trip, trip inside
trip, trip, trip inside

crimson flames tied through my ears
rollin' high and mighty traps
pounced with fire on flaming roads
using ideas as my maps
"we'll meet on edges, soon," said i
proud 'neath heated brow
ah, but i was so much older then
i'm younger than that now
half wracked prejudice leaped forth
"rip down all hate," i screamed
lies that life is black and white
spoke from my skull. i dreamed
romantic facts of musketeers
foundationed deep, somehow
ah, but i was so much older then
i'm younger than that now
girls' faces formed the forward path
from phony jealousy
to memorizing politics
of ancient history
flung down by corpse evangelists
unthought of, though, somehow
ah, but i was so much older then
i'm younger than that now
a self ordained professor's tongue
too serious to fool
spouted out that liberty
is just equality in school
"equality," i spoke the word
as if a wedding vow
ah, but i was so much older then
i'm younger than that now
in a soldier's stance, i aimed my hand
at the mongrel dogs who teach
fearing not that i'd become my enemy
in the instant that i preach
my pathway led by confusion boats
mutiny from stern to bow
ah, but i was so much older then
i'm younger than that now
yes, my guard stood hard when abstract threats
too noble to neglect
deceived me into thinking
i had something to protect
good and bad, i define these terms
quite clear, no doubt, somehow
ah, but i was so much older then
i'm younger than that now

you walk into the room
with your pencil in your hand
you see somebody naked
and you say, "who is that man?"
you try so hard
but you don't understand
just what you'll say
when you get home
because something is happening here
but you don't know what it is
do you, mister jones?
you raise up your head
and you ask, "is this where it is?"
and somebody points to you and says
"it's his"
and you say, "what's mine?"
and somebody else says, "where what is?"
and you say, "oh my god
am i here all alone?"
because something is happening here
but you don't know what it is
do you, mister jones?
you hand in your ticket
and you go watch the geek
who immediately walks up to you
when he hears you speak
and says, "how does it feel
to be such a freak?"
and you say, "impossible"
as he hands you a bone
because something is happening here
but you don't know what it is
do you, mister jones?
you have many contacts
among the lumberjacks
to get you facts
when someone attacks your imagination
but nobody has any respect
anyway they already expect you
to just give a check
to tax deductible charity organizations
you've been with the professors
and they've all liked your looks
with great lawyers you have
discussed lepers and crooks
you've been through all of
f. scott fitzgerald's books
you're very well read
it's well known
because something is happening here
but you don't know what it is
do you, mister jones?
well, the sword swallower, he comes up to you
and then he kneels
he crosses himself
and then he clicks his high heels
and without further notice
he asks you how it feels
and he says, "here is your throat back
thanks for the loan"
because something is happening here
but you don't know what it is
do you, mister jones?
now you see this one eyed midget
shouting the word "now"
and you say, "for what reason?"
and he says, "how?"
and you say, "what does this mean?"
and he screams back, "you're a cow
give me some milk
or else go home"
because something is happening here
but you don't know what it is
do you, mister jones?
well, you walk into the room
like a camel and then you frown
you put your eyes in your pocket
and your nose on the ground
there ought to be a law
against you comin' around
you should be made
to wear earphones
because something is happening here
but you don't know what it is
do you, mister jones?


i just wanted to be one of the strokes
now look at the mess you made me make
hitchhiking with a monogrammed suitcase
miles away from any half useful imaginary highway
i'm a big name in deep space, ask your mates
but golden boy's in bad shape
i found out the hard way that
here ain't no place for dolls like you and me
everybody's on a barge
floating down the endless stream of great tv
1984, 2019

maybe i was a little too wild in the '70s
rocket ship grease down the cracks of my knuckles
karate bandana, warp speed chic
hair down to there, impressive moustache
love came in a bottle with a twist off cap
let's all have a swig and do a hot lap

so who you gonna call?
the martini police
baby, that isn't how they look tonight, oh no
it took the light forever to get to your eyes

i just wanted to be one of those ghosts
you thought that you could forget
and then i haunt you via the rear view mirror
on a long drive from the back seat
but it's alright, 'cause you love me
and you recognise that it ain't how it should be
your eyes are heavy and the weather's getting ugly
so pull over, i know the place
don't you know an apparition is a cheap date?
what exactly is it you've been drinking these days?
jukebox in the corner, "long hot summer"
they've got a film up on the wall and it's dark enough to dance
what do you mean you've never seen blade runner?

oh, maybe i was a little too wild in the '70s
back down to earth with a lounge singer shimmer
elevator down to my make believe residency
from the honeymoon suite
two shows a day, four nights a week
easy money

so who you gonna call?
the martini police
so who you gonna call?
the martini police
oh, baby, that isn't how they look tonight
it took the light absolutely forever to get to your eyes

and as we gaze skyward, ain't it dark early?
it's the star treatment
yeah, and as we gaze skyward, ain't it dark early?
it's the star treatment
it's the star treatment
the star treatment


i could have told you
she'd hurt you
she'd you love you a while
then desert you
if only you asked
i could have told you so

i could have saved you
some crying
yes, i could have told you she's lying
but you were in love
and didn't want to know

i hear her now
as i toss and turn and try to sleep
i hear her now
making promises she'll never keep
and soon, it's over and done with
she'll find someone new to have fun with
through all of my tears
i could have told you so

i hear her now
as i toss and turn and try to sleep
i hear her now
making promises she'll never keep
and soon, it's over and done with
she'll find someone new to have fun with
through all of my tears
i could have told you so


come to decide that the things that i tried
were in my life just to get high on
when i sit alone, come get a little known
but i need more than myself this time
step from the road to the sea to the sky
and i do believe that we rely on
when i lay it on, come get to play it on
all my life to sacrifice

hey, oh
listen what i say, oh
i got your hey, oh
now listen what i say, oh

when will i know that i really can't go
to the well once more time to decide on
when it's killing me, when will i really see
all that i need to look inside?
come to believe that i better not leave
before i get my chance to ride
when it's killing me, what do i really need
all that i need to look inside

hey, oh
listen what i say, oh
come back and hey, oh
look at what i say, oh

the more i see, the less i know
the more i like to let it go
hey oh, whoa whoa

deep beneath the cover of another perfect wonder
where it's so white as snow
privately divided by a world so undecided
and there's nowhere to go
in between the cover of another perfect wonder
and it's so white as snow
running through the field where all my tracks will be concealed
and there's nowhere to go
ho 

when to descend to amend for a friend
all the channels that have broken down
now you bring it up, i'm gonna ring it up
just to hear you sing it out
step from the road to the sea to the sky
and i do believe what we rely on
when i lay it on, come get to play it on
all my life to sacrifice

hey, oh
listen what i say, oh
i got your hey, oh
listen what i say, oh

the more i see, the less i know

and there's nowhere to go
in between the cover of another perfect wonder

running through the field where all my tracks will be concealed
and there's nowhere to go

i said hey, hey yeah
oh yeah, tell my love now
hey, hey yeah

deep beneath the cover of another perfect wonder
where it's so white as snow
privately divided by a world so undecided

like a party bag of lies, booze, and then deceit
and i don't know why i want to voice this out loud

and we're not the same and i will wear that on my sleeve
so i'm moving to new york, 'cause i've got issues with my sleep

and am i losing touch or am i just completely off the track?
and i don't know why i want to voice this out loud
it's therapeutic somehow

so i'm moving to new york, 'cause i've got problems with my sleep
and we're not the same and i will wear that on my sleeve

clean shirt, new shoes
and i don't know where i am goin' to
silk suit, black tie  black tie 
i don't need a reason why

and cufflinks, stick pin

okay

i'm feeling the way that i'm feeling myself
fuck everyone else
gotta remember that nobody is better than anyone else, here
 do you need some time to think it over? 
look what they do to you
look what they do to me
must be joking if you think that either one is free, here

get up off your knees, girl
stand face to face with your god
and find out what you are
 hello, my name is human 
hello, my name is human
and i came down from the stars
 hello, my name is human 

i'm ready for love, and i'm ready for war
but i'm ready for more
i know that nobody's ever been this fucking ready before, hey
 do you need some time to think it over? 
so figure it out, or don't figure it out
i figured it out
the bigger the river  the bigger the river 
the bigger the drought  the bigger the drought 

get up off your knees, boy
stand face to face with your god
and find out what you are

i stole my power from the sun
i'm more than just a man
 no longer disillusioned 

 i'm not asking questions 
 'cause questions have answers 
 and i don't want answers 
i came down from the stars  so i'll take my chances 
 and what are the chances 
 that i could advance 
 on my own circumstances 
 said "what are the chances?" 
hello, my name is human  and what are the chances? 
 i don't want your answers 
 i'm not asking questions 
 so you keep your answers 
and i know who i am  so you keep your answers 
 i'm not asking questions 
 i'm taking my chances 


love is blindness, i don't want to see
won't you wrap the night around me?
oh, my heart, love is blindness

i'm in a parked car, on a crowded street
you see your love made complete
thread is ripping, the knot is slipping
love is blindness

love is clockworks and cold steel
fingers too numb to feel
squeeze the handle, blow out the candle
love is blindness

love is blindness, i don't want to see
won't you wrap the night around me?
oh, my love
blindness

a little death without mourning
no call and no warning
baby, a dangerous idea
that almost makes sense

love is drowning in a deep well
all the secrets, and nobody else to tell
take the money
why don't you honey?
blindness

love is blindness
i'm so sick of it, i don't want to see
why don't you just take the night
wrap it all around me?
oh, my love
blindness
love is blindness
oh, i'm too numb to feel
blow out the candles
blindness

and i swear
besides the hair
she had one white eye
one blank stare

black rum, sugar cane
dry ice and something strange

and a prostitute too
icky thump
handcuffed to a bunk
robbed blind
looked around
and there was nobody else
left alone
i hit myself with a stone
went home and learned how
to clean up after myself

i only lie when i love you
i only crawl when i hit the ground
you only cry when i love you
i only lie when i make a sound

go ahead, muck about
i got my conscience twisted
pull your hair, make me shout
it's just that you insisted i was good for nothing
like you were onto something

i only lie when i love you
i only crawl when i hit the ground
you only cry when i love you
i only lie when i make a sound
i only lie when i
i only lie when i

i only crawl when i hit the ground
you only cry when i love you
i only lie when i make a sound

go ahead, pull the plug
broken finger, sticky trigger
now i can't get it off my chest
and now i'm wishing you were someone else
you know i'm up to something
diagnosed, no disease
got a suspicion but you just can't find it up your sleeve
and now i beg the truth be told from someone else
all of that fuss for nothing

i only lie when i love you
i only crawl when i hit the ground
you only cry when i love you
i only lie when i make a sound

in my defence all my intentions were good
and heaven holds a place somewhere for the misunderstood
you know i'd give you blood if it'd be enough
devils on my doorstep since the day i was born
it's hard to find a sunset in the eye of a storm
but i'm a dreamer by design and i know in time we'll put this behind

for what it's worth i'm sorry for the hurt
i'll be the first to say, "i made my own mistakes"
for what it's worth i know it's just a word and words betray
sometimes we lose our way
for what it's worth

behind the lens is a poison picture you paint
and lets not pretend you were ever searching for saints
'cause i've been crucified for just being alive
somewhere in the crossfire of this whispering war
seems that i've forgot just what i was fighting for
but underneath my skin there's a fire within
still burning

for what it's worth i'm sorry for the hurt
i'll be the first to say, "i made my own mistakes"
for what it's worth i know it's just a word and words betray
sometimes we lose our way
for what it's worth

the first bird to fly gets all the arrows
let's leave the past behind with all our sorrows
i'll build a bridge between us and i'll swallow my pride

for what it's worth i'm sorry for the hurt
i'll be the first to say, "i made my own mistakes"
for what it's worth i know it's just a word and words betray
sometimes we lose our way
for what it's worth


birds flying high, you know how i feel
sun in the sky, you know how i feel
reeds drifting on by, you know how i feel
it's a new dawn, it's a new day, it's a new life for me
and i'm feeling good

fish in the sea, you know how i feel
river running free, you know how i feel
blossom in the trees, you know how i feel
it's a new dawn, it's a new day, it's a new life for me
and i'm feeling good

dragonflies out in the sun
you know what i mean, don't you know?
butterflies are all having fun
you know what i mean
sleep in peace
when the day is done
and this old world is a new world and a bold world
for me

stars when you shine, you know how i feel
scent of the pine, you know how i feel
yeah, freedom is mine and you know how i feel
it's a new dawn, it's a new day, it's a new life for me

butterflies, ooh
oh, ooh ...
ooooh...freer than you...ooooh...

i'll take a bruise; i know you're worth it
when you hit me hit me hard

sitting in a wishing hole
hoping it stays dry
feet cast in solid stone
i've got gilligan's eyes

i still believe it's you and me 'til the end of time

when we collide we come together
if we don't we'll always be apart
i'll take a bruise; i know you're worth it
when you hit me hit me hard

you said love was letting us go against what
our future is for...
many of horror
our future's for many of horror

i still believe it's you and me 'til the end of time

when we collide we come together
if we don't we'll always be apart
i'll take a bruise; i know you're worth it
when you hit me hit me hard

can you feel it, can you feel it, can you feel it
if you look around
the whole world is coming together now
can you feel it, can you feel it, can you feel it
feel it in the air, the wind is taking it everywhere
can you feel it, can you feel it, can you feel it
all the colors of the world should be
lovin' each other wholeheartedly
yes, it's all right
take my message to your brother and tell him twice
spread the word and try to teach the man
who's hating his brother, when hate won't do
cause  we're all the same, yes the blood inside me is inside you now tell me
can you feel it, can you feel it, can you feel it, now tell me
can you feel it, can you feel it, can you feel it
sing out loud
because we want to make a crowd
touch a hand and sing a sound so pure, salvation rings
can you feel it, can you feel it, can you feel it
can you feel it, can you feel it, can you feel it
all the children of the world should be
loving each other wholeheartedly
yes, it's all right
take my message to your brother and tell him twice
take the news to the marching men
who are killing their brothers, when death won't do
cause we're all the same
yes, the blood inside me is inside of you, now tell me
can you feel it, can you feel it, can you feel it
can you feel it, can you feel it, can you feel it
every breath you take
is someone's death in another place
every healthy smile
is hunger and strife to another child
but the stars do shine
in promising salvation, is near this time
can you feel it now
so brothers and  sisters
show we know how
now tell me
can you feel it, can you feel it, can you feel it
can you feel it, can you feel it, can you feel it
all the children of the world should be
loving each other wholeheartedly

who are killing their brothers, when death won't do
cause we're all the same

can you feel it, can you feel it, can you feel it
can you feel it, can you feel it, can you feel it

i am an american aquarium drinker
i assassin down the avenue
i'm hiding out in the big city blinking
what was i thinking when i let go of you?
let's forget about the tongue tied lightning
let's undress just like cross eyed strangers
this is not a joke, so please stop smiling
what was i thinking when i said it didn't hurt?
i want to glide through those brown eyes dreaming
take it from the inside, baby hold on tight
you were so right when you said that i've been drinking
what was i thinking when i said good night?
i want to hold you in the bible black predawn
you're quite a quiet domino, bury me now
take off your band aid because i don't believe in touchdowns
what was i thinking when i said hello?
i'd always thought that if i held you tightly
you'd always love me like you did back then
then i fell asleep and the city kept blinking
what was i thinking when i let you back in?
i am trying to break your heart
i am trying to break your heart
but still,  i'd be lying if i said it wasn't easy
i am trying to break your heart
disposable dixie cup drinking
i assassin down the avenue
i'm hiding out in the big city blinking
what was i thinking when i let go of you?
 ... loves you
i'm the man who loves you

tumble outta bed
and stumble to the kitchen
pour myself a cup of ambition
yawnin' and stretchin' and try to come to life
jump in the shower
and the blood starts pumpin'
out on the streets
the traffic starts jumpin'
with folks like me on the job from 9 to 5

working 9 to 5
what a way to make a living
barely gettin' by
it's all taking
and no giving
they just use your mind
and they never give you credit
it's enough to drive you
crazy if you let it

9 to 5, for service and devotion
you would think that i
would deserve a fair promotion
want to move ahead
but the boss won't seem to let me
i swear sometimes that man is out to get me
mmmmm...
they let you dream
just to watch them shatter
you're just a step
on the boss man's ladder
but you got dreams he'll never take away
in the same boat
with a lot of your friends
waiting for the day
your ship will come in
and the tide's gonna turn
an' it's all gonna roll you away

working 9 to 5
what a way to make a living
barely gettin' by
it's all taking
and no giving
they just use your mind
and you never get the credit
it's enough to drive you
crazy if you let it
9 to 5, yeah, they got you where they want you
there's a better life
and you think about it don't you
it's a rich man's game
no matter what they call it
and you spend your life
putting money in his wallet

heaven, i'm in heaven
and my heart beats so that i can hardly speak
and i seem to find the happiness i seek
when we're out together dancing cheek to cheek
oh, heaven, i'm in heaven
and the cares that hung around me through the week
seem to vanish like a gamblers lucky streak
when we're out together dancing cheek to cheek
oh, i love to climb a mountain and to reach the highest peak
but it doesn't thrill me half as much as dancing cheek to cheek
oh, i love to go out fishing in a river or a creek
but i don't enjoy it half as much as dancing cheek to cheek
dance with me, i want my arm about you
that charm about you will carry me through to ...
heaven, oh, i'm in heaven
and my heart beats so that i can hardly speak
and i seem to find the happiness i seek
when we're out together swinging cheek to cheek, yeah, yeah

give me only what i need
it doesn't take too much to keep me satisfied
down to work for my money and earn my keep
hunger's got a way to tame a man's pride
can we build it up?
i know that we can
let's get to work every woman and man
with pressure and time
i said i'm gonna get mine
i'm not asking for a throne and crown
i'm not pining for a starving queen
tooth and nail will wear any man down
and my mama keeps telling me i'm lookin' too lean
can we build it up?
i know that we can
let's get to work every woman and man
with pressure and time
i said i'm gonna get mine
take me out of this mudslide or never enough
let me eat from the fruit right off of the tree
when god gets his rest because six days are just too rough
i can only pray he doesn't forget about me


i can barely look at you
don't tell me who you lost it to
didn't we say we had a deal?
didn't i say how bad i'd feel?
everyone needs a helping hand
who said i would not understand?
someone up the social scale
for when you're going off the rails, have

post break up sex
that helps you forget your ex
what did you expect from post break up sex?

leave it 'til the guilt consumes
fucking in the nearest room
all our friends were unaware
most had just passed out downstairs
to think i'd hoped you'd be okay
no, i can't think of what to say
maybe i misunderstood
but i can't believe you're feeling good from

let me run with you tonight
i'll take you on a moonlight ride
there's someone i used to see
but she don't give a damn for me

but let me get to the point, let's roll another joint
and turn the radio loud, i'm too alone to be proud
you don't know how it feels
you don't know how it feels to be me

people come, people go
some grow young, some grow cold
i woke up in between
a memory and a dream

so let's get to the point, let's roll another joint
and let's head on down the road, there's somewhere i gotta go
you don't know how it feels
you don't know how it feels to be me

my old man was born to rock
he's still tryin' to beat the clock
think of me what you will
i've got a little space to fill

so let's get to the point, let's roll another joint
and let's head on down the road, there's somewhere i gotta go
you don't know how it feels
you don't know how it feels
no, you don't know how it feels to be me
you don't know how it feels
you don't know how it feels
no, you don't know how it feels to be me

she calls me from the cold
just when i was low
feeling short of stable
all that she intends
and all she keeps inside
isn't on the label
she says she's ashamed
can she take me for a while?
can i be a friend?
we'll forget the past
or maybe i'm not able
and i break at the bend
we're here and now
will we ever be again?
'cause i have found
all that shimmers in this world is sure to fade
away again
she dreams a champagne dream
strawberry surprise
pink linen on white paper
lavender and cream
fields of butterflies
reality escapes her
she says that love
is for fools that fall behind
and i'm somewhere between
i never really know
a killer from a savior
'til i break at the bend
we're here and now
will we ever be again?
'cause i have found
all that shimmers in this world is sure to fade
away again
it's too far away for me to hold
too far away
it's too far away for me to hold
too far away, ah ow
yeah, it's too far away for me to hold
too far away, ah ow
it's too far away for me to hold
too far away
it's too far away for me to hold
too far away, ah ow
it's too far away for me to hold
too far away
guess i'll let it go


reluctantly crouched at the starting line
engines pumping and thumping in time
the green light flashes, the flags go up
churning and burning, they yearn for the cup
they deftly maneuver and muscle for rank
fuel burning fast on an empty tank
reckless and wild, they pour through the turns
their prowess is potent and secretly stern
as they speed through the finish, the flags go down
the fans get up and they get out of town
the arena is empty except for one man
still driving and striving as fast as he can

the sun has gone down and the moon has come up
and long ago somebody left with the cup
but he's driving and striving and hugging the turns
and thinking of someone for whom he still burns

he's going the distance
he's going for speed
she's all alone
in her time of need
because he's racing and pacing and plotting the course
he's fighting and biting and riding on his horse
he's going the distance

no trophy, no flowers, no flashbulbs, no wine
he's haunted by something he cannot define
bowel shaking earthquakes of doubt and remorse
assail him, impale him with monster truck force
in his mind, he's still driving, still making the grade
she's hoping in time that her memories will fade
cause he's racing and pacing and plotting the course
he's fighting and biting and riding on his horse

goodbye, little robin marie
don't try following me
don't cry, little robin marie
'cause you know i'm coming home soon
my ships' leaving on a three year tour
the next tide will take us from shore
windlaced, gather in sail and spray
on a search for the mighty sperm whale
fly your willow branches
wrap your body round my soul
lay down your reeds and drums on my soft sheets
there are years behind us reaching
to the place where hearts are beating
and i know you're the last true love i'll ever meet
and i know you're the last true love i'll ever meet
starbuck's sharpening his harpoon
the black man is playing his tune
an old salt's sleeping his watch away
he'll be drunk again before noon
three years sailing on bended knee
we found no whales in the sea
don't cry, little robin marie
'cause we'll be in sight of land soon
fly your willow branches
wrap your body round my soul
lay down your reeds and drums on my soft sheets
there are years behind us reaching
to the place where hearts are beating
and i know you're the last true love i'll ever meet
and i know you're the last true love i'll ever meet

how did it feel
when it came alive and took you
out of the black? it broke your skin and shook through
every part of me, every part of you

you made a fool out of me and took the skin off my back running
so don t breathe when i talk, cause you haven t been spoken to
i ve got a gun for a mouth and a bullet with your name on it
but a trigger for a heart bleeding blood from an empty pocket

i never knew why and you didn t care when
it closed every door, and washed away no sin
and i promised you like you promised me
but those vows we made fucked it up for free

you made a fool out of me and took the skin off my back running
so don t breathe when i talk, cause you haven t been spoken to
i ve got a gun for a mouth and a bullet with your name on it
but a trigger for a heart bleeding blood from an empty pocket

and it tortures slow
never lets you go
deals a crooked hand

since forever, i still remember
like the light of the sun
you used to brightened my day
but darkness ha taken your place
and i can no longer keep it away
since forever, i still remember your ways
since forever, i still remember
i ask you for one last time
no there won't be any wine
just one more time
so you can put flowers on my grave
and then leave again... since forever

when i hear your name
i start to shake inside
when i see you stroll
i lose my self control
but that's what love is
that s what love will make you do
no matter how i fight it
oh, i'm still in love with you
if you'll ever need me
there s no limit to what i'll do
i'll work eight days a week, pretty girl
then give it all to you
well, that's what love is
that's what love will make you do
no matter how i fight it
oh, i'm still in love with you
when they talk about beauty
you can stand the test
when they talk about makin' love
baby, you're the best
don t want to brag about you, baby
and give people wrong ideas
i m tryin' hard to say what i mean
to say how i really feel
and then that s what love is
that's what love will make you do
no matter how i fight it
baby, i'm still in love with you




i'm going to tell ya what it's all about
when you're driving down the highway at night
and you're feeling that wild turkey's bite
don't give johnny walker a ride
cause jack black is right by your side
you might get taken to the jailhouse and find
you've been arrested for driving while blind
now just the other night with nothing to do
we broke a case of proof 102
and started itching for that wonderful feel
of rolling in an automobile
you could say we was out of our mind
and let me tell you we were flying while blind
then they had us up against the wall
hey it's only blood grain alcohol
and there ain't no cause for alarm
we ain't out to do nobody no harm
how could anyone be so unkind
to arrest a man for driving while blind


we're bound to wait all night
she's bound to run amok
invested enough in it anyhow
and to each his own
the garden is sorting out
she curls her lips on a barrel
"i don't know if you're dead or not
if you're anyone"

come on and get the minimum
before you open up your eyes
this army has so many heads, to analyze
come on and get your overdose
collect it at the borderline
and they want to get up in your head

cause they know and so do i
the high road is hard to find
a detour in your new life
tell all of your friends goodbye

the dawn to end all nights
that's all we hoped it was
a break from the warfare in your house
but to each his own
a soldier is bailing out
and curled his lips on the barrel
and i don't know if the dead can talk, to anyone

come on and get the minimum
before you open up your eyes
this army has so many heads, are you one of us?
come on and get your overdose
collect it at the borderline
and they want to get up in your head

cause they know and so do i
the high road is hard to find
a detour in your new life
tell all of your friends goodbye

it's too late to change your mind
you've let loss be your guide
it's too late to change your mind
you've let loss be your guide
it's too late to change your mind
you've let loss be your guide
it's too late to change your mind
you've let loss be your guide


i feel for you, but when did you believe you were alone?
you say that spiders crawled inside
and made themselves a home where light once was
petrified of who you are and who you have become
you will hide from everyone
denying you need someone to exterminate your bones

friend, please remove your hands from over your eyes for me
i know you want to leave
but friend, please don't take your life away from me

living like a ghost, you walk by everyone you know
you say that you're fine, but you have lost your sway and glow
so i stopped by to let you know

friend, please remove your hands from over your eyes for me
i know you want to leave
but friend, please don't take your life away from me

would you let me know your plans tonight?
cause i just won't let go 'til we both see the light
and i have nothing else left to say
but i will listen to you all day
yes, i will

friend, please remove your hands from over your eyes for me
i know you want to leave
but friend, please don't take your life away from me

know it sounds funny
but, i just can't stand the pain
girl, i'm leaving you tomorrow
seems to me girl
you know i've done all i can
you see i begged, stole, and i borrowed   yeah 

ooh that's why i'm easy
i'm easy like sunday morning
that's why i'm easy
i'm easy like sunday morning 
i wanna be high, so high
i wanna be free to know
the things i do are right
i wanna be free
just me  whoa, oh  baby 
ugh 




what can you buy
that lifts a heavy heart up to the sky?
what makes your day?
what miracle of life
has come to stay?
a taste of love
so sweet, so real you can't let go
and how does it feel?
it feels so good...

but how much do you need?
how much, how much do you need?
how much do you need?
how much, how much do you need?
i want a nice car
a girlfriend
who's as pretty as a star
i want respect
as much, as much as i can get

restless
i feel so restless
and in this changing world
i am lost for words
i feel so restless
ain't got no interest
i couldn't care less
can't be a success

due to current studies
the fiscal climate isn't looking good
get out of town
the streets are running  rivers full of blood
the more i see
the less, the less that i believe
the more i hear
the less, the less that i perceive

restless
i feel so restless
and in this changing world
i am lost for words
i feel so restless
ain't got no interest
i couldn't care less
can't be a success
what can you buy
that lifts a heavy heart up to the sky?
what makes your day?
what miracle of life
has come to stay?
a taste of love
so sweet, so real you can't let go
and how does it feel?
it feels so good...

restless
i am so restless
and this changing world
leaves me speechless
i am lost for words
but i kept my nerve
but it's not hopeless
if you take rest


i couldn't speak so i slurred while i looked for a word
but you left just before i could find it
i sat by myself and i stared at the pictures of you on the wall

i kissed the floor, curled up in a ball
there's nothing coming out of my mouth so i said nothing at all

babe, you've got a face like thunder
always trying to get out with another
just stay still 'til i say it's over
babe, you've got a face like thunder

and you question your lover, did she really believe
that this new taste of love is obsolete?  
it just couldn't compete and so you ll keep dragging your body through life by the hair so you can say that you've been somewhere and you don't care of your receipt
you're sentenced to death and you can't be reprieved

babe, you've got a face like thunder
always trying to get out with another
just stay still 'til i say it's over
babe, you've got a face like thunder

say sorry for a while, for a while, for a while
you know i didn't mean it
i said something terrible and i tried to redeem it
i can be so cruel although i don't seem it

babe, you've got a face like thunder
always trying to get out with another
just stay still 'til i say it's over
babe, you've got a face like thunder

millions of people living as foes
maybe it's not too late
to learn how to love and forget how to hate
mental wounds not healing
life's a bitter shame
i'm going off the rails on a crazy train
i'm going off the rails on a crazy train
let's go 
i've listened to preachers, i've listened to fools
i've watched all the dropouts who make their own rules
one person conditioned to rule and control
the media sells it and you live the role
mental wounds still screaming
driving me insane
i'm going off the rails on a crazy train
i'm going off the rails on a crazy train
i know that things are going wrong for me
you gotta listen to my words
yeah

heirs of a cold war, that's what we've become
inheriting troubles, i'm mentally numb
crazy, i just cannot bear
i'm living with something' that just isn't fair
mental wounds not healing
who and what's to blame?
i'm going off the rails on a crazy train
i'm going off the rails on a crazy train


she took my heart, left me for dead
and drank my blood, told me she said
our secret's worth, its weight in gold
that fire we had, now is turning cold

cut loose like an animal
fired out like a cannonball
but i waited too long
yeah i waited too long
got high from a holy vein
crashed down in a hurricane
love has been here and gone
love has been here and gone

where did you go? where did you run?
i can't erase what you've done
let's burn the past, forget the truth
you're still loving him, i'm still loving you

cut loose like an animal
fired out like a cannon ball
but i waited too long
yeah, i waited too long
got high from a holy vein
crashed down in a hurricane
love has been here and gone
love has been here and gone
cut loose like an animal
fired out like a cannon ball
but i waited too long
yeah, i waited too long
got high from a holy vein
crashed down in a hurricane
love has been here and gone
love has been here and gone

but i waited too long for you, only
love has been here and gone, to die slowly
going under again, so don't follow me


waiting with my arms out
whisper then a loud shout
lost in the way she says my name
i'm such a creep
fortune brought me lovers
shadowed taro colors
fated to kill the sweetest things
one by one

hey, what's that from above?
is it love for blood?
hey, what's that from above?
is it love for blood?

hiding in the silence
one way form of violence
taste of the thunder from her thighs
makes me shake
calmly kicking outwards
is she misunderstood?
walking along the razor's edge
and she sweetly moans

hey, what's that from above?
is it love for blood?


hey, what's that from above?
is it love for blood?
hey, what's that from above?
is it love for blood?
hey, what's that from above?
is it love for blood?

one last kiss and away she goes
obsessed with loveblood and yet no one knows

fell in love with a girl
i fell in love once and almost completely
she's in love with the world
but sometimes, these feelings can be so misleading
she turns and says, "are you alright?"
i said, "i must be fine 'cause my heart's still beating."
"come and kiss me by the riverside
bobby says it's fine, he don't consider it cheating."

red hair with a curl
mello roll for the flavor
and the eyes were peeping
can't keep away from the girl
these two sides of my brain need to have a meeting

can't think of anything to do, yeah
my left brain knows that all love is fleeting
she's just looking for something new, yeah
i said it once before
but it bears repeating, now
can't think of anything to do, yeah
my left brain knows that all love is fleeting
she's just looking for something new
well, i said it once before
but it bears repeating, now

she's just looking for something new
well, i said it once before
but it bears repeating, now


don't get any big ideas
they're not gonna happen

you paint yourself white
and fill up with noise
but there'll be something missing

now that you've found it, it's gone
now that you feel it, you don't
you've gone off the rails

so don't get any big ideas
they're not gonna happen
you'll go to hell for what your dirty mind is thinking


i met her on monday
she looked like a god
and threw back in my face
my love now i'm gone

stoned
in my metal zone
i take rock 'n' roll
to get radical

i'm not goin' insane
i just need more fun
but dear going your way
i do what i want

stoned
in my metal zone
i take rock 'n' roll
to get radical

i've been tryin' to find you
you keep movin' ahead
once could never deny you
now i wish you were dead

do you remember when word was bond
a fleeting promise in the light of the dawn
barren december under a falling sky
the end of days and a reason to die
obliteration never looked so divine
holding your breath for the moment in time
you lived through hell, now you're trying to die
the skin is healed but you're bleeding inside
shots fired just to numb the pain
there's no one left to save
night blind on the shining path
ghost walking in the aftermath
hypnotized, 60 cycle hum
the broken cadence of a distant drum
21 to 1 i'm liking the odds
a blood junkie with a lightning rod
a dirty rig and a heavenly nod
and still you wind up nowhere
obliteration never looked so divine
holding your breath for the moment in time
you lived through hell, now you're trying to die
the skin is healed but you're bleeding inside
shots fired just to numb the pain
there's no one left to save
there's no one left to save
there's no one left to save
you
you chase the dragon but it follows you home
now
you lost the fever dreams and broken hope
lost
desolation never looked so divine
promise yourself for the very last time
you lived through hell, now you're trying to die
the skin is healed but you're bleeding inside
shots fired just to numb the pain
there's no one left to save
there's no one left to save
 ohhh...  there's no one left
a fever dream
there's no one left to save
shots forever end the pain
there's no one left to save

feels like, feels like it s coming
it feels like, feels like a coming of age

and when my fear pulls me out to sea
and the stars are hidden by my pride and my enemies
i seem to hurt the people that care the most
just like an animal i protect my pride
when i'm too bruised to fight
and even when i'm wrong i tend to think i'm right

well i m bored of the game
and too tired to rage

feels like, feels like it s coming
it feels like, feels

thunder on the mountain, fires on the moon
there's a ruckus in the alley and the sun will be here soon
today's the day, gonna grab my trombone and blow
well, there's hot stuff here and it's everywhere i go
i was thinking' 'bout alicia keys, couldn't keep from crying
when she was born in hell's kitchen, i was living down the line
i'm wondering where in the world alicia keys could be
i have been looking for her even clear through tennessee
feel like my soul is beginning to expand
look into my heart and you will sort of understand
you brought me here, now you're trying to run me away
the writing's on the wall, come read it, come see what it say
thunder on the mountain, rolling like a drum
gonna sleep over there, that's where the music coming from
i don't need any guide, i already know the way
remember this, i'm your servant both night and day
the pistols are poppin' and the power is down
i'd like to try something' but i'm so far from town
the sun keeps shining'
and the north wind keeps picking up speed
gonna forget about myself for a while, gonna go out and see what others need
i've been sitting down studying the art of love
i think it will fit me like a glove
i want some real good woman to do just what i say
everybody got to wonder
what's the matter with this cruel world today
thunder on the mountain rolling to the ground
gonna get up in the morning walk the hard road down
some sweet day i'll stand beside my king
i wouldn't betray your love or any other thing
gonna raise me an army, some tough sons of bitches
i'll recruit my army from the orphanages
i been to st. herman's church and i've said my religious vows
i've sucked the milk out of a thousand cows
i got the porkchops, she got the pie
she ain't no angel and neither am i
shame on your greed, shame on your wicked schemes
i'll say this, i don't give a damn about your dreams
thunder on the mountain heavy as can be
mean old twister bearing down on me
all the ladies of washington scrambling to get out of town
looks like something bad gonna happen
better roll your airplane down
everybody's going and i want to go too
don't wanna take a chance with somebody new
i did all i could and i did it right there and then
i've already confessed   no need to confess again
gonna make a lot of money, gonna go up north
i'll plant and i'll harvest what the earth brings forth
the hammer's on the table, the pitchfork's on the shelf
for the love of god, you ought to take pity on yourself

wish i was too dead to cry
my self affliction fades
stones to throw at my creator
masochists to which i cater

you don't need to bother;
i don't need to be
i'll keep slipping farther
but once i hold on
i won't let go 'til it bleeds

wish i was too dead to care
if indeed i cared at all
never had a voice to protest
so you fed me shit to digest
i wish i had a reason;
my flaws are open season
for this, i gave up trying
one good turn deserves my dying

you don't need to bother;
i don't need to be
i'll keep slipping farther
but once i hold on
i won't let go 'til it bleeds


wish i'd died instead of lived
a zombie hides my face
shell forgotten
with its memories
diaries left
with cryptic entries

you don't need to bother;
i don't need to be
i'll keep slipping farther
but once i hold on
i won't let go 'til it bleeds
you don't need to bother;
i don't need to be
i'll keep slipping farther
but once i hold on:
i'll never live down my deceit

there s two in brilliant
we are the wolves of winter
we live in a kingdom of blood

when you gonna rise, seek a man you can dispose of?
when you gonna try to boil my last bone?
this is true obsession
take me and my worth
subtle as a steam burn
more than just a scald

you stink of hallelujah
but you wash yourself in sin
well have you seen her?
this heavenly creature
this is the point we have the choice to survive the winter

we have achieved so much more
than you possibly thought we could
love that you re seething
you can achieve anything
just remember, no "i" in team
there s two in brilliant
we are the wolves of winter
we live in a kingdom of blood


we are the wolves of winter
we live in a kingdom of blood


hey, honey, what you trying to say?
as i stand here, don't you walk away
and the world comes tumbling down
hand in hand in a violent life
making love on the edge of a knife
and the world comes tumbling down

and it's hard for me to say
and it's hard for me to stay
i'm going down to be by myself
i'm going back for the good of my health
and there's one thing i couldn't do
sacrifice myself to you

one week struggling on the real world is
so you can see
feel your soul and shape your mind to warfare
it's all for real
live your life, not the way they taught you
do what you feel
survive this jungle, give me blood, give me pain
these scars won't heal

what were you thinking?
what a wonderful world?
you're full of shit
leave it behind, they don't care if you cry
all you left is pain

can you take it?
can you take it?
can you take it?
can you take it?

the only way to get away
kill your pride
attitude

i won't take it
i won't take it
i won't take it
i won't take it

so in the end, i want to see some respect
i said, you better show some respect
i said, attitude and respect

nobody you meet could ever see
the loneliness there
inside you
hey there, georgy girl
why do all the boys just pass you by?
could it be you just don't try
or is it the clothes you wear?
you're always window shopping
but never stopping to buy

a little bit
hey there, georgy girl

two scientists are racing
for the cure of all mankind
both of them side by side
so determined
locked in heated battle
for the cure that is their prize
but it's so dangerous
but they're determined

theirs is to win
if it kills them
they're just humans
with wives and children
upwards to the vanguard
where the pressure is so high
under the microscope
hope against hope
forging for the future
but to sacrifice their lives
both of them side by side
so determined

i'm taking all you down with me
explosives duct taped to my spine
nothings gonna change my mind
i won't listen to anyone's last words
there's nothing left for you to say
soon you'll be dead anyway

no one here is getting out alive
this time i've really lost my mind and i don't care
so close your eyes and kiss yourself goodbye
and think about the times you spent and what they've meant
to me it's nothing
to me it's nothing
to me it's nothing
to me it's nothing

i'm losing all my happiness
the happiness you pinned on me
loneliness still comforts me
my anger dwells inside of me
i'm taking it all out on you
and all the shit you put me through

well no one here is getting out alive

do you ever think back to another time?
does it bring you so down that you thought you lost your mind?
do you ever want to lead a long trail of destruction
and mow down any bullshit that confronts you?
do you ever build up all the small things in your head?
to make one problem that adds up to nothing
to me it's nothing
to me it's nothing
to me it's nothing


i don't know why i love her like i do
all the changes you put me through
take my money, my cigarettes
i haven't seen the worst of it yet

i wanna know, can you tell me?
i'd love to stay

take me to the river, drop me in the water
take me to the river, dip me in the water
washing me down, washing me down

i don't know why you treat me so bad
think of all the things that we could have had
love is an ocean that i can't forget
my sweet sixteen i would never regret

i wanna know, can you tell me?
i'd love to stay

take me to the river, drop me in the water
push me in the river, dip me in the water
washing me down, washing me

hug me, squeeze me, love me, tease me
'til i can't, 'til i can't, 'til i can't take no more of it

take me to the water, drop me in the river
push me in the water, drop me in the river
washing me down, washing me down

i don't know why i love her like i do
all the trouble you put me through
sixteen candles there on my wall

and she was a lover to me, to me, to me, to me

which way is the graveyard?
i'm an iceberg with a warm heart
i'm spiritual, not religious
i'm a libra, if it matters
shattered by an email
your words will fade away
castle built in the sand
will only last one day

i'm holding on and i don't want to let you go
yeah it feels like summer
yeah it feels like summer to me
yeah it feels like summer
yeah it feels like summer to me
when she was a lover to me

flowers in her hair, but it just ain't right
june bride, shine so bright
flowers in her hair, we look good together

when she was a lover to me

pedro lives out of the wilshire hotel
he looks out a window without glass
the walls are made of cardboard, newspapers on his feet
his father beats him cause he's too tired to beg
he's got 9 brothers and sisters
they're brought up on their knees
it's hard to run when a coat hanger beats you on the thighs
pedro dreams of being older and killing the old man
but that's a slim chance he's going to the boulevard
he's going to end up, on the dirty boulevard
he's going out, to the dirty boulevard
he's going down, to the dirty boulevard
this room cost 2,000 dollars a month
you can believe it man it's true
somewhere a landlord's laughing till he wets his pants
no one here dreams of being a doctor or a lawyer or anything
they dream of dealing on the dirty boulevard
give me your hungry, your tired your poor i'll piss on 'em
that's what the statue of bigotry says
your poor huddled masses, let's club 'em to death
and get it over with and just dump 'em on the boulevard
get 'em out, on the dirty boulevard
going out, to the dirty boulevard
they're going down, on the dirty boulevard
going out
outside it's a bright night
there's an opera at lincoln center
movie stars arrive by limousine
the klieg lights shoot up over the skyline of manhattan
but the lights are out on the mean streets
a small kid stands by the lincoln tunnel
he's selling plastic roses for a buck
the traffic's backed up to 39th street
the tv whores are calling the cops out for a suck
and back at the wilshire, pedro sits there dreaming
he's found a book on magic in a garbage can
he looks at the pictures and stares at the cracked ceiling
"at the count of 3" he says, "i hope i can disappear"
and fly fly away, from this dirty boulevard
i want to fly, from dirty boulevard
i want to fly, from dirty boulevard
i want to fly fly fly fly, from dirty boulevard
i want to fly away
i want to fly
fly, fly away
i want to fly
fly fly away  fly a  
fly fly fly   way, ooohhh... 
fly fly away  i want to fly fly away 
fly away  i want to fly, wow woh, no, fly away 


it's bugging me, grating me
and twisting me around
yeah i'm endlessly caving in
and turning inside out

cause i want it now
i want it now
give me your heart and your soul
and i'm breaking out
i'm breaking out
last chance to lose control

it's holding me, morphing me
and forcing me to strive
to be endlessly cold within
and dreaming i'm alive

cause i want it now
i want it now
give me your heart and your soul
i'm not breaking down
i'm breaking out
last chance to lose control


and i want you now
i want you now
i'll feel my heart implode
and i'm breaking out
escaping now
feeling my faith erode


put on my blue suede shoes
and i boarded the plane
touched down in the land of the delta blues
in the middle of the pouring rain
w.c. handy won't you look down over me
yeah i got a first class ticket
but i'm as blue as a boy can be

then i'm walking in memphis
walking with my feet ten feet off of beale
walking in memphis
but do i really feel the way i feel

saw the ghost of elvis
on union avenue
followed him up to the gates of graceland
then i watched him walk right through
now security they did not see him
they just hovered around his tomb
but there's a pretty little thing
waiting for the king
down in the jungle room

then i'm walking in memphis
walking with my feet ten feet off of beale
walking in memphis
but do i really feel the way i feel

they've got catfish on the table
they've got gospel in the air
and reverend green will be glad to see you
when you haven't got a prayer
but boy you've got a prayer in memphis

now muriel plays piano
every friday at the hollywood
and they brought me down to see her
and they asked me if i would
do a little number
and i sang with all my might
and she said
"tell me are you a christian child?"
and i said "ma'am i am tonight"

then i'm walking in memphis
walking with my feet ten feet off of beale
walking in memphis
but do i really feel the way i feel
then i'm walking in memphis
walking with my feet ten feet off of beale

and i boarded the plane

i would dig a thousand holes to lay next to you
i would dig a thousand more if i needed to
i look around the grave for an escape route of old routines
there doesn t seem to be any other way

cause i ve started falling apart, i m not savoring life
i ve forgotten how good it could be to feel alive

crazy as it sounds, you won't feel as low as you feel right now
at least that s what i've been told by everyone
i whisper empty sounds in your ear and hope that you won t let go
take the pieces and build them skywards

take the pieces and build them skywards
and
take the pieces and build them skywards
and
take the pieces and build them up to the sky

road trippin  with my two favorite allies
fully loaded we got snacks and supplies

these smiling eyes are just a mirror for
so much as come before those battles lost and won
this life is shining more forever in the sun
now let us check our heads
and let us check the surf
staying high and dry s
more trouble than it s worth
in the sun
just a mirror for the sun
just a mirror for the sun
just a mirror for the sun
these smiling eyes are just a mirror for
in big sur we take some time to linger on
we three hunky dory s got our snakefinger on
now let us drink the stars
it s time to steal away
let s go get lost
right here in the u.s.a
let s go get lost
let s go get lost
blue you sit so pretty
west of the one

sittin' on my own
chewing on a bone
a thousand million
miles from home
when something hit me
somewhere right between the eyes
sleeping on a plane
you know you can't complain
you took your last chance
once again
i landed, stranded
hardly even knew your name

i wanna talk tonight
until the mornin' light
'bout how you saved my life
you and me see how we are
you and me see how we are

all your dreams are made
of strawberry lemonade
and you make sure
i eat today
you take me walking
to where you played
when you were young
i'll never say that i
won't ever make you cry
and this i'll say
i don't know why
i know i'm leavin'
but i'll be back another day

i want to talk tonight
until the mornin' light
'bout how you saved my life
 you saved my life 
i want to talk tonight
 i want to talk tonight 
'bout how you saved my life
 i want to talk tonight 
 i want to talk tonight 
 i want to talk tonight 
 i want to talk tonight 


we chase misprinted lies
we face the path of time
and yet i fight, and yet i fight this battle all alone
no one to cry to, no place to call home

oooh... oooh...
oooh... oooh...

my gift of self is raped
my privacy is raked
and yet i find, and yet i find repeating in my head
if i can't be my own, i'd feel better dead

oooh... oooh...
oooh... oooh...


my friends are so depressed
i feel the question
of your loneliness
confide, cause i'll be on your side
you know i will, you know i will

ex girlfriend called me up
alone and desperate
on the prison phone
they want to give her 7 years
for being sad

i love all of you
hurt by the cold
so hard and lonely too
when you don't know yourself

my friends are so distressed
and standing on
the brink of emptiness
no words i know of to express
this emptiness

i love all of you
hurt by the cold
so hard and lonely too
when you don't know yourself

imagine me, taught by tragedy
release is peace

i heard a little girl
and what she said
was something beautiful
to give your love
no matter what
and what she said

i love all of you
hurt by the cold
so hard and lonely too
when you don't know yourself

i wish i could tell you
but the words would come out wrong
oh, if you only knew
the way i felt for so long
i know that we're worlds apart
but i just don't seem to care
these feelings in my heart
only with you i wanna share
the first time i caught
a glimpse of you
then all my thoughts
were only of you
i hope that when time goes by
you will think the same about me
many nights awake i lie
i only wish that you could see
i know that we're only friends
i hope this feeling never ends
if i could only hold you
it's the only thing i wanna do
the first time i caught
a glimpse of you
then all my thoughts
were only of you


it s been like a year since i ve been home
flirting with an addiction i can t shake off
my mouth is dry, i self medicate
this comedown won't cure itself
it s driving you away
it s driving you away
piece by piece
day by day

baby
tell me if i'm being strange
and if i need to rearrange my particles
i will for you
my particles, i will for you

and i m the shadow of a ghost
it's feeling as if somebody has taken host
babe, i don t want to make a scene
but i get self destructive
and it s driving you away
it s driving you away
piece by piece
day by day

baby
tell me if i'm being strange
and if i need to rearrange my particles
i will for you

oh, doctor please, this don t feel right
oh, can t you give me something
to get me through the night
oh, if it all falls apart
and if this thing goes wrong
oh, put me back together
however you want
my mind plays tricks
and i don t sleep no more
doctor, please
i can t switch off

baby
tell me if i'm being strange
and if i need to rearrange my particles
i will for you
my particles, i will for you

come with me and let's go for a ride
follow me to the other side
as i sit around and watch you pout
'cause i know that you're the
best thing in town
best thing around
best thing in town
best thing around
running wild and always running free
doing things that i have never seen
eerie colors and all i see are sounds
now i know that you're the
best thing in town
best thing around
best thing in town
best thing around
i'm seeing faces
of mysteries of the earth
i am not one
to the aggressions of my birth
or go to stance
of solutions i can't find
a missing piece
of a thought that's in my mind
come with me and let's go for a ride
follow me to the other side
as i sit around and watch you pout
'cause i know that you're the
best thing in town
best thing around
best thing in town
best thing around
running wild and always running free
doing things that i have never seen
eerie colors and all i see are sounds
now i know that you're the
best thing in town
best thing around
best thing in town
best thing around
sick and tired of all this wild shit


i don't know you, but i think i hate you
you're the reason for my misery
strange how you've become my biggest enemy
and i've never even seen your face

maybe it's just jealousy
mixing up with a violent mind
a circumstance that doesn't make much sense
or maybe i'm just dumb

you're the cloud hanging out over my head
hail comes crashing down, welting my face
magic man, egocentric plastic man
yet you still got one over on me

maybe it's just jealousy
mixing up with a violent mind
a circumstance that doesn't make much sense
or maybe i'm just dumb
i'm a chump 



this is definitely not the first video to surface of an execution. the blue stash of men, they claimed responsibility for the executions. described as severely mentally disturbed. it appears to show another hostage executed by the terrorist group. deserve to be annihilated.

i get my kicks and i wanna start a rager
i wanna dance like i'm on the video
i got a fever for the violent behavior
i'm sweatin' bullets like a modern romeo

bang, bang, give me fame

give me death or give me head
daddy's little psycho and mommy's little soldier

i testify like a lullaby of memories
broadcasting live and it's on my radio
i got my photobomb, i got my vietnam
i love a lie just like anybody else

bang, bang, give me fame
shoot me up to entertain
i am a semi automatic lonely boy
you're dead, i'm well fed
give me death or give me head
broadcasting from my room and playin' with my toys
i wanna be a celebrity martyr
the leading man in my own private drama
hoorah, bang, bang, hoorah, bang, bang, the hero of the hour
daddy's little psycho and mommy's little soldier

i wanna be like the soldiers on the screen
it's my private movie  holy war 
oh baby, baby, this is viva vendetta
oh this is love or it's world war zero

i wanna be a celebrity martyr
the leading man in my own private drama
hoorah, bang, bang, hoorah, bang, bang, the hero of the hour
daddy's little psycho and mommy's little soldier
i wanna be a celebrity martyr

hoorah, bang, bang, hoorah, bang, bang, the hero of the hour
daddy's little psycho and mommy's little soldier


the club isn't the best place to find a lover
so the bar is where i go
me and my friends at the table doing shots
drinking fast and then we talk slow
and you come over and start up a conversation with just me
and trust me i'll give it a chance now
take my hand, stop, put van the man on the jukebox
and then we start to dance, and now i'm singing like

one week in we let the story begin
we're going out on our first date
you and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
fill up your bag and i fill up a plate
we talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
and how your family is doing okay
leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
tell the driver make the radio play, and i'm singing like

hey, mr. tambourine man, play a song for me
in the jingle jangle morning, i'll come followin' you
take me for a trip upon your magic swirlin' ship
all my senses have been stripped
and my hands can't feel to grip
and my toes too numb to step
wait only for my boot heels to be wanderin'
i'm ready to go anywhere, i'm ready for to fade
unto my own parade
cast your dancing spell my way
i promise to go under it
hey, mr. tambourine man, play a song for me

such a shame to believe in escape
a life on every face
and that's a change
'til i'm finally left with an eight
tell me to relax, i just stare
maybe i don't know if i should change
a feeling that we share
it's a shame

 such a shame 
number me with rage, it's a shame
 such a shame 
number me in haste  such a shame 
this eagerness to change
it's a shame

the dice decide my fate
and that's a shame
in these trembling hands
my faith tells me to react, i don't care
maybe it's unkind that i should change
a feeling that we share
it's a shame

 such a shame 
number me with rage, it's a shame
 such a shame 
number me in haste  such a shame 
this eagerness to change
such a shame

tell me to relax, i just stare
maybe i don't know if i should change
a feeling that we share
it's a shame

 such a shame 
number me with rage, it's a shame
 such a shame 
number me in haste, it's a shame
 such a shame 
write it across my name
 such a shame 
number me with rage
this eagerness to change

such a shame


i would not expect you felt alone in standing north
better to rise above the clouds
then be a stranger in the crowd
all that you protected doesn t matter anymore
rather be stripped of all your pride
than watch your dreams be cast aside

you are caught up in your gravity
glorifying stardom
singing your own praise

you live without shame
you re digging up a gold mine
standing on the sidelines
watching through the looking glass

you are not content with being nameless and unknown
trying to rise above the fray
eager to give it all away
some will not admit that 15 minutes have expired
too much attention much too soon
don t see you walking on the moon

you are caught up in your gravity
bathing in the spotlight
imitating fame

you live without shame
you re digging up a gold mine
standing on the sidelines
watching through the looking glass


you are caught up in your gravity
glorifying madness
singing your own praise

you live without shame
you re digging up a gold mine
standing on the sidelines
watching through the looking glass
you live without shame
you re digging up a gold mine
standing on the sidelines
watching through the looking glass


touch 

i'll stand for nothing less
or never stand again
these are the limits when one's buried
this body's left the soul

could we have known?
never would i, helped to nail down

careful of drifting off
now losing taste and touch
turning a pale blue, leaning in to say
this body's left the soul
the brain needs oxygen
can't sneak around this bait
his catacomb has got me by the chin
this body's left the soul

could we have known?
never would i, helped to nail down
with nothing to gain
here's the clincher, this should be you

now saturate, now saturate
now saturate, now saturate and touch 
now saturate  now saturate 
now saturate, the earth 
now saturate, now saturate
now saturate, the earth  

well could we have known?
never would i, helped to nail down
 i'll stand for nothing less 
with nothing to gain, here's the clincher
this should be you, made cold and crippled
this happened to be, never changing
holding inside  or never stand again

kitty malone sat on a mule
was riding in style
when suddenly, like the sound of a buzzard s breaking
kitty felt laser beams being fired at her head
she said, "i hate laser beams
and you never done see me askin 
for a ufo
in tomahawk county"
well she kicked the mule
and it walked the path
and the aliens fired from behind
till she stopped the mule
and she kicked the rump
and the big old mule took a big old dump

scent of a mule, you better watch out where you go
take your laser beams away
scent of a mule, you better watch out where you go
you better stop that laser game

or you ll smell my mule
she felt the fire against her neck
and it saddened her to feel it burn
when suddenly, like the sound of a breeding holstein
kitty said, "stop, we ain t lookin  for fightin 
in tomahawk county."
a little guy from the ufo
came on out and said his name was joe
she said, "come on over for some lemonade
just follow me now with the whole brigade"
scent of a mule 
they walked into her cabin shack
they had never seen a southern home
and they liked it, better than their ufo
they liked it, they really liked it
they said, "here s a place of elegance
here we shower ourselves in lightness"

when i became the sun
i shone life into the man's hearts
when i became the sun
i shone life into the man's hearts



so this ain't the end, i saw you again today
i had to turn my heart away
smile like the sun, kisses for everyone
and tales, it never fails 

you lying so low into the weeds
i bet you gonna ambush me
you'd have me down, down, down, down on my knees
now won't you, barracuda?


back over time, we were all trying for free
you met the porpoise and me
no right, no wrong, you're selling a song, a name
whisper game

and if the real thing don't do the trick
you better make up something quick
you gonna burn, burn, burn, burn burn to the wick
ooh, barracuda

"sell me sell you" the porpoise said
dive down deep to save my head
i think that you got the blues, too
all that night and all the next
swam without looking back
made for the western pools, silly, silly fools 


if the real thing don't do the trick, no
you better make up something quick
you gonna burn, burn, burn, burn, burn it to the wick
ohh, bara barracuda

i liked having hurt
so send the pain below, where i need it
you used to beg me to take care of things
and smile at the thought of me failing
but long before having hurt
i'd send the pain below
i'd send the pain below

much like suffocating
much like suffocating
much like suffocating
 i'd send the pain below

my pain is self chosen

i could either burn
or cut off my pride and buy some time
a head full of lies is the weight, tied to my waist

the river of deceit pulls down, oh oh
the only direction we flow is down
down, oh down
down, oh down
down, oh down
down, oh down

my pain is self chosen
at least i believe it to be
i could either drown
or pull off my skin and swim to shore

the river of deceit pulls down, yeah
the only direction we flow is down
down, oh down
down, oh down
down, oh down
down, oh down

the pain is self chosen, yeah
our pain is self chosen


like a cause without a martyr
like an effigy of balsa
like a hairline crack in a radiator
leaking life

i shout out but it just spins faster
i crawl up but my knees are water
i cling on by my nails to the sweet disaster

and then i fall to the floor like my strings are cut
pinch myself but i don't wake up
spit in the wind cause too much is not enough
it starts and ends with you
it starts and ends with you

and i've worn so many faces
shot my love at fifteen paces
my inheritance is all the thoughts i can't sweep away

i shout out but it just spins faster
i crawl up but my knees are water
i cling on by my nails to the sweet disaster

and then i fall to the floor like my strings are cut
pinch myself but i don't wake up
spit in the wind cause too much is not enough
it starts and ends with you

she calls me from the cold
just when i was low
feeling short of stable
all that she intends
and all she keeps inside
isn't on the label
she says she's ashamed
can she take me for a while?
can i be a friend?
we'll forget the past
or maybe i'm not able
and i break at the bend
we're here and now
will we ever be again?
'cause i have found
all that shimmers in this world is sure to fade
away again
she dreams a champagne dream
strawberry surprise
pink linen on white paper
lavender and cream
fields of butterflies
reality escapes her
she says that love
is for fools that fall behind
and i'm somewhere between
i never really know
a killer from a savior
'til i break at the bend
we're here and now
will we ever be again?
'cause i have found
all that shimmers in this world is sure to fade
away again
it's too far away for me to hold
too far away
it's too far away for me to hold
too far away, ah ow
yeah, it's too far away for me to hold
too far away, ah ow
it's too far away for me to hold
too far away
it's too far away for me to hold
too far away, ah ow
it's too far away for me to hold
too far away

this'll get you out of your head
china's hanging out by the railings
of the motorshed
she goes with a real hit biker
he's a metalhead
she looks me up and down
talking dirty eyes
sweet saying boy baby
i could lick ya any time
keep it up
that's right...here we go again
bit later i'm going to run
into her round the back
while other guys break heads
in the sugar shack
don't give me drink i don't want to
get too stoned
then we're going to see who's going to
take who home

the violence of summer
a love's taking over
it starts with desire
ends up under cover

those lips will make me rise
you may look down but don't think twice
slow death is on the way
so what man i still want to play
one, two
this'll get you out of your mind
this'll get you up...let's go
maybe take a ride going south
where her mother writes
before bad news catches up
we still got a little time
we'll leave it all so far away
one thing is sure we shouldn't stay
i take it all little chine going to
get the runaround a run... a runaround


china... na china...nanana
china... na china...nanana
china... na china...nanana
china... na china...nana


mine, immaculate dream made breath and skin
i've been waiting for you
signed, with a home tattoo
happy birthday to you was created for you
 can't ever keep from falling apart at the seams 
 can not believe you've taken my heart to pieces 
oh, it'll take a little time
might take a little crime
to come undone now
we'll try to stay blind
to the hope and fear outside
hey child, stay wilder than the wind
and blow me into cry
who do you need, who do you love
when you come undone?
who do you need, who do you love
when you come undone?
words, playing me deja vu
like a radio tune i swear i've heard before
chills, is it something real
or the magic i'm feeding off your fingers?
 can not forgive from falling apart at the seams 
 can not believe you're taking my heart to pieces 
lost, in a snow filled sky
we'll make it alright
to come undone now
we'll try to stay blind
to the hope and fear outside
hey child, stay wilder than the wind
and blow me into cry
who do you need, who do you love
when you come undone?
who do you need, who do you love
when you come undone?
 can not forgive from falling apart 
who do you need, who do you love
when you come undone?
 can not forgive from falling apart 
who do you need, who do you love?
 can not forgive from falling apart 
who do you love
when you come undone?
 can not forgive from falling apart 


i could stay awake just to hear you breathin'
watch you smile while you are sleeping
while you're far away and dreaming
i could spend my life in this sweet surrender
i could stay lost in this moment forever
where every moment spent with you is a moment i treasure

don't want to close my eyes
i don't want to fall asleep
'cause i'd miss you, baby
and i don't wanna miss a thing
'cause even when i dream of you  even when i dream 
the sweetest dream would never do
i'd still miss you, babe
and i don't want to miss a thing

lying close to you feeling your heart beating
and i'm wondering what you're dreaming
wonderin' if it's me you're seeing
then i kiss your eyes and thank god we're together
and i just want to stay with you
in this moment forever
forever and ever

i don't want to close my eyes
i don't want to fall asleep
'cause i'd miss you, baby
and i don't wanna miss a thing
'cause even when i dream of you  even when i dream 
the sweetest dream would never do
i'd still miss you, baby
and i don't want to miss a thing

i don't want to miss one smile
i don't want to miss one kiss
well, i just want to be with you
right here with you, just like this
i just want to hold you close
i feel your heart so close to mine
and just stay here in this moment
for all the rest of time
yeah  yeah 
yeah  yeah 
yeah 

don't want to close my eyes
don't want to fall asleep
'cause i'd miss you, baby
and i don't wanna miss a thing
'cause even when i dream of you  even when i dream 
the sweetest dream would never do
i'd still miss you, baby

and i don't want to miss a thing

don't want to close my eyes
i don't want to fall asleep, yeah
i don't want to miss a thing


i'm only pretty sure that i can't take anymore
before you take a swing
i wonder what are we fighting for
when i say out loud
"i want to get out of this"
i wonder is there anything
i'm going to miss

i wonder how it's going to be
when you don't know me
how's it going to be
when you're sure i'm not there
how's it going to be
when there's no one there to talk to
between you and me
'cause i don't care
how's it going to be
how's it going to be

where we used to laugh
there's a shouting match
sharp as a thumbnail scratch
a silence i can't ignore
like the hammock by the
doorway we spent time in, swings empty
don't see lightning like last fall
when it was always about to hit me

i wonder how's it going to be
when it goes down
how's it going to be
when you're not around
how's it going to be
when you found out there was nothing
between you and me
cause i don't care
how's it going to be
how's it going to be

and how's it going to be
when you don't know me anymore
and how's it going to be
want to get myself back in again
the soft dive of oblivion
i want to taste the salt of your skin
the soft dive of oblivion  oblivion 

how's it going to be
when you don't know me anymore
how's it going to be?
how's it going to be?

you are stellar
meet me in outer space
we could spend the night
watch the earth come up
i've grown tired of that place
won't you come with me?
we could start again
how do you do it?
make me feel like i do
how do you do it?
it's better than i ever knew, ho
meet me in outer space
i will hold you close
if you're afraid of heights
i need you to see this place
it might be the only way
that i can show you how
it feels to be inside you
how do you do it?
make me feel like i do
how do you do it?
it's better than i ever knew, yeah
how do you do it?
make me feel like i do
you do
ohh
you are stellar
you are stellar
how do you do it?
make me feel like i do
how do you do it?
it's better than i ever knew, oh
how do you do it?
make me feel like i do
how do you do it?
make me feel like i do
yeah

what happened to me?
felt like i had everything
such a big catastrophe, but i had to deal with the struggle
it all began passing life so easily
ready for almost anything, but it took a different direction
then, one night, sharp turns
a light came from nowhere
blown away
never felt my injuries
bleeding deep inside of me
just knew i had to help all those people
lost
my mind
it's gone
that life
lost
i've been looking for myself
it haunts me everyday
i'm searching for a truth no longer there
transformed i'm someone else
must face my phantom self
transformed i'm someone else
must face my phantom self
it's a mystery
changed my body's chemistry
always creeping up on me
wiped out my whole soul of existence
the crash
flashbacks
carnage
the blood keeps on flowing
killing me
trapped inside this tragedy
can't see the road in front of me
replay this nightmare over and over
lost
i've been looking for myself
it haunts me everyday
i'm searching for a truth no longer there
transformed i'm someone else
must face my phantom self
transformed i'm someone else
i'll face my phantom self
lost
i've been looking for myself
it haunts me everyday
i'm searching for a truth no longer there
transformed i'm someone else
must face my phantom self
transformed i'm someone else
i'll face my phantom self

somewhere out where no one knows
runs a cool evolution fight
way out there where no one goes
and it's got to keep moving
got to keep getting it right
sphere's to the piston charged
ombustable delight
the single minded supercharged
that' got to get moving
got to keep getting it right
a call to arms
a call right through the dream
a call to action
blow up the in between
feed, feed your engine
feed, feed your wolverine
feed, feed the tension
mean green killing machine
c'mon, c'mon and say what my name is
mean green killing machine
the clock, your only friend
as time leaves it's debris
your soul is on the mend
but time is killing me
i gave you everything
but a machine
i'll always be
they got nothing more to add to the conversation
they drink gasoline from a dirty glass
they got nothing but a sad sad situation
with nothing more to ad to the damnation
nuts   bolts   screws with no social class
they got nothing but a sad sad situation
it's a sad, sad, sad situation
nuts   bolts   screws, balls of brass
if you're out where no one goes
where no one cares to lie
keep 'em open don't you blink
i'm talking 'bout, talking 'bout your eyes
it's faster than the speed of light
and sonically disguised
there comes the mean green motherfucker blazing 'cross the sky
a call to arms
a call right through the dream
a call to action
blow up the in between
feed, feed your engine
feed, feed your wolverine
feed, feed the tension
mean green killing machine
killing machine
killing machine
mean green killing machine

i am a sinner and i worship evil
blood is thinner but you will never know
can you confess that you thrive in chaos?
you're a sorceress and your eye is on the lost
but you're dying
it's in your eyes
you're a charlatan, you get everything you wish
you're a harlot, carry poison in your kiss
beg forgiveness with a dagger in your hand
sow your death seed and reap the dying lands
but you're crying
it's only vice
empty vessel
drained of hope
and none the lesser at the end of
a rope
have you ever hated like i?
know i still awaited the absence of lies
watch your eager tongue
attack me from behind
riddle whispers, bleak futile control
like a twin sister adapting to a role
you're a murderer, bloodlust increase
you're a harvester, come close to spread disease
and you're hiding
i hear you cry


i'm only pretty sure that i can't take anymore
before you take a swing
i wonder what are we fighting for
when i say out loud
"i want to get out of this"
i wonder is there anything
i'm going to miss

i wonder how it's going to be
when you don't know me
how's it going to be
when you're sure i'm not there
how's it going to be
when there's no one there to talk to
between you and me
'cause i don't care
how's it going to be
how's it going to be

where we used to laugh
there's a shouting match
sharp as a thumbnail scratch
a silence i can't ignore
like the hammock by the
doorway we spent time in, swings empty
don't see lightning like last fall
when it was always about to hit me

i wonder how's it going to be
when it goes down
how's it going to be
when you're not around
how's it going to be
when you found out there was nothing
between you and me
cause i don't care
how's it going to be
how's it going to be

and how's it going to be
when you don't know me anymore
and how's it going to be
want to get myself back in again
the soft dive of oblivion
i want to taste the salt of your skin
the soft dive of oblivion  oblivion 

how's it going to be
when you don't know me anymore
how's it going to be?
how's it going to be?

how many times have you heard someone say
if i had money, i would do things my way
but little they know that it's so hard to find
one rich man in ten with a satisfied mind
money can't buy back all your youth when you're old
a friend, when you're lonely, or peace to your soul
the wealthiest person is a pauper at times
compared to the man with a satisfied mind
when my life is over and my time has run out
my friends and my loved ones, i will leave, there's no doubt
but, one thing's for certain, when it comes my time
i'll leave this old world with a satisfied mind
one thing's for certain, when it comes my time
i'll leave this old world with a satisfied mind
satisfied mind


and it's been awhile since i could hold my head up high
and it's been awhile since i first saw you
and it's been awhile since i could stand on my own two feet again
and it's been awhile since i could call you

and everything i can't remember
as fucked up as it all may seem
the consequences that are rendered
i've stretched myself beyond my means

and it's been awhile since i can say that i wasn't addicted
and it's been awhile since i can say i love myself as well and
and it's been awhile since i've gone and fucked things up just like i always do
and it's been a while, but all that shit seems to disappear when i'm with you

and everything i can't remember
as fucked up as it all may seem
the consequences that i've rendered
i've gone and fucked things up again, again

why must i feel this way?
just make this go away
just one more peaceful day

and it's been awhile since i could look at myself straight
and it's been awhile since i said i'm sorry
and it's been awhile since i've seen the way the candles light your face
and it's been awhile, but i can still remember just the way you taste

and everything i can't remember
as fucked up as it all may seem to be, and i know it's me
i cannot blame this on my father
he did the best he could for me

and it's been awhile since i could hold my head up high
and it's been awhile since i said i'm sorry


awake on my airplane, awake on my airplane

in your sanctity, your privacy
i don't believe in, i don't believe in
sanctity, a hypocrisy

no one should be left alone?
could everyone agree that
they should not be left alone? yeah
and i feel like a newborn
and i feel like a newborn
 kicking and screaming 

could you take my picture?
'cause i won't remember

a universe to fill
i can't scratch the surface now
a slow pay still
why's everyone watching?
it's like i'm real tired of the clones
i'm real tired of the clones

painful silence, painful silence  kills

people don't know much
need a whiskey crutch
to think of something new
hey you watching me
lookin' through a screen
i'm here in front of you

sometimes the days, they feel so long
yeah, we all live under the same sun

so i hit my head up against the wall
over and over and over and over again, and again
'cause i don't wanna be like them
i hit my head up against the wall
over and over and over and over again, and again, and again

people piss you off
some you say you love
those you call a friend
walking through a crowd
then you look around
see there's no one left

we live and then we die as one
yeah, we all live under the same sun

so i hit my head up against the wall
over and over and over and over again, and again
'cause i don't wanna be like them
i hit my head up against the wall
over and over and over and over again, and again, and again

i left my heart in amsterdam
where i could dream and nights were long
i left my heart in amsterdam
i hit my head against the wall
over, over, over
again and again and then over
over, over
again and again and then over
over, over
again and again and then over
over, over

so i hit my head up against the wall
over and over and over and over again, and again
'cause i don't wanna be like them
i hit my head up against the wall
over and over and over and over again
and again, and again

oh, i left my heart in amsterdam
i left my heart in amsterdam
oh, i left my heart in amsterdam
i really need that feeling back, yeah

i never thought you'd hurt me
i guess you live and learn
that when you're playin' with fire you're bound to get burned
i've been mistreated, i've been used before
i get kicked in the face still i come back for more
but i won't cry no more 'cause the tears are all in vain
we can pick up the pieces and start it all again
let's just get back to the way it was before
oh, girl i can't take anymore

and it's hard to believe you still treat me this way
but i won't cry no more 'cause the tears are all in vain
we can pick up the pieces and start it all again

i buried my heart in a hole in the ground
with the lights and the roses and the cowards downtown
they threw me a party, there was no one around
they tried to call my girl but she could not be found

i buried my guilt in a pit in the sand
with the rust and the vultures and the trash downtown
so don't step to me, kid, you'll never be found
cause while you were sleeping, i took over your town

down, down, down, down, down, down
when the lights go down, down, down, down, down, down
when the lights go

they put out the lights

when the lights go down, down, down, down, down, down
when the lights go


the lights go out and i can't be saved
tides that i tried to swim against
have brought me down upon my knees
oh i beg, i beg and plead, singing

come out of things unsaid
shoot an apple off my head and a
trouble that can't be named
a tiger's waiting to be tamed, singing 

you  are 
you  are 

confusion that never stops
closing walls and ticking clocks
gonna come back and take you home
i could not stop that you now know, singing

come out upon my seas
cursed missed opportunities
am i a part of the cure?
or am i part of the disease? singing 

you  are 
you  are 
you  are 
you  are 
you  are 
you  are 

and nothing else compares
oh nothing else compares
and nothing else compares

you  are

 home  home
where i wanted to go
 home  home
where i wanted to go
 home  home  you  
where i wanted to go  are

where i wanted to go  are  


i'm on it, get on it
the troops are on fire
you know i need it much closer
i'm trading just a little more
step on it, electronic
the troops are on fire
i'm much deeper, a sleeper
i'm waiting for the final trip
come on it, get on it
i'm carving through a letter bomb
i need it like potions
these drugs are just an hour away
come on it, electronic
a polyphonic prostitute
the motor's on fire
messiah for the animals

oh come on
we got our backs to the wall
get on and watch out, say
you're gonna kill us all

the dance floor's a temptress
can't make out what your saying
but you rub me the right way
with your child like persuasion
i got my hands in my pockets
and i'm crossing my fingers
she'll find i'm a simple stone
washed up and so slow
i'd take one in the temple
i'd take one for you
i'd take one in the temple
i'd take one for you
i'd take one in the temple
i'd take one for you
i feel all amiss now
i'm tossed in the scatter
and your eyes keep on shifting
to the boys that don't matter
i've got my hands in my pockets
i'm still crossing my fingers
i'd take one in the temple
i'd take one for you
i'd take one in the temple
i'd take one for you
i'd take one in the temple
i'd take one for you
i've got my hands in my pockets
and i'm crossing my fingers
i just want to be noticed
i just want to be noticed
i'd take one in the temple
i'd take one for you
i'd take one in the temple
i'd take one for you
i'd take one in the temple
i'd take one for you
i'd take one in the temple
i'd take one for you

the knowledge that seeking the favor of another
means the murder of self
this is the resolution
the end of all progress
the death of evolution
it bleeds all life away
silence speeds the path to the streams of solace that run so few and narrow
brooks that babble the sounds of torture
sounds of torture
you will one day rise
to flood the banks of the chosen
this is the art of ruin
this is the resolution
the end of all progress
the death of evolution
it bleeds all life away
it bleeds all life away
i will show you all that i have mastered
fear
pain
hatred
power
this is the art of ruin
this is the art of ruin
this is the art of ruin


to be lost in the forest, to be cut adrift
you've been trying to reach me, you bought me a book
to be lost in the forest, to be caught adrift
i've been paid, i've been paid
to be lost in the forest, to be cut adrift
you've been trying to reach me, you bought me a book

i've been paid, i've been weighed, i've been

don't get offended if i seem absent minded
just keep telling me facts and keep making me smile and
don't get offended if i seem absent minded
i get tongue tied
baby, you've got to be more discerning
i've never known what's good for me
baby, you've got to be more demanding
i will be yours

i'll pay for you any time
i'll pay for you any time

and you told me you wanted to eat up my sadness
well jump on, enjoy, you can gorge away
and you told me you wanted to eat up my sadness
jump right
baby, you've got to be more discerning
i've never known what's good for me and
baby, you've got to be more demanding
jump left
what are you holding out for?
what's always in the way?
why so damn absent minded?
why so scared of romance?

this modern love breaks me
this modern love wastes me
this modern love breaks me
this modern love wastes me

do you wanna come over and kill some time?
do you wanna come over and kill some time?
do you wanna come over and kill some time?
throw your arms around me


recall
the earth shattering exchange
what did you gain?
and what was lost, what was lost?

forget what they say
step into the ancient world
where blood meets the sea
and stale limbs hang off the old

in the mirror there s a shimmer of a ghost trying to awake
i ve been trying so hard to make no big mistakes
higher states, now we resonate, bodies slipping into place
if this is still the same cage, then take me far away

when was
the last time you spread your wings
and flew towards the closest blonde
to fall from grace, fall from grace?

forget what they say
 forget what they say 
step into the ancient world
 step into the ancient world 
where blood meets the sea
when faith was free instead of sold

in the mirror there s a shimmer of a ghost trying to awake
i ve been trying so hard to make no big mistakes
higher states, now we resonate, bodies slipping into place
if this is still the same cage, then take me far away

what good is love and peace on earth
when it's exclusive?
where's the truth in the written word
if no one reads it?
a new day dawning
comes without warning
so don't think twice

we live in troubled times
we live in troubled times

what part of history we've learned
when it's repeated?
some things we'll never overcome
if we don't seek it
the world stops turning
paradise burning
so don't think twice

we live in troubled times
we live in troubled times
we live in troubled times

we run for cover
like a skyscraper's falling down
and then i wonder
like a troubled mind

what good is love and peace on earth
when it's exclusive?
where's the truth in the written word
if no one reads it?
a new day dawning
comes without warning
so don't look twice

we live in troubled times

we're smashing mics in karaoke bars
you're running late with half your make up on
this method acting might pay our bills
but soon enough there'll be a different role to fill

i love this feeling, but i hate this part
i wanted this to work so much, i drew up our plans on a chart
cars are flipping; i'm in hot pursuit
my character's strong, but my head is loose

she hits like ecstasy
comes up and bangs the sense out of me 

the tarot cards say it's not so bad
and the blades rotate; there's just no landing pad
and better have said it but, darling, you're the best
i'm just tired of falling up the penrose steps

i hate this feeling
but i love this part
she really wants to make it work
and i clearly want to let it start
we'll build a water slide
as soon as i get home

oh and she hits like ecstasy
comes up and bangs the sense out of me
it's wrong but surely worse to leave
she hits like ecstasy

so free up the cheaper seats
here comes a greek tragedy

pardon me sugar i m the man underneath your thumb
but i won t take your violence and i won t chew your bubblegum
white heat, indiscreet, any day now obsolete
though you ve seen your best days
i would still walk down your empty street
well you look like salvation but you taste like a refugee
well you say you got no soul but you look like you do to me
if i was the melody you were the symphony
honey loving you took the very best of me
i don t need your red wine covered sympathy
just another punch line in your stand up tragedy
well i ve been pushing up daisies
just to catch a glimpse of something real
when i see you coming
i might just as well give up and kneel
well if you saw me broken
would you put me out my misery?
well i don t do handsome and you don t do sympathy
if i was the melody you were the symphony
honey loving you took the very best of me
i don t need your red wine covered sympathy
just another punchline in your stand up tragedy
wrong from the get go, let it slide
tell them what they don t know
sing them praises far and wide
give those speeches, ring them bells
mama don t know what she preaches
but she sure looks dignified
well she sure looks dignified
well she sure looks dignified
if i was the melody you were the symphony
honey loving you took the very best of me
i don t need your red wine covered sympathy
just another punchline in your stand up tragedy
take my hungry guarantee
i could be your slave if you d only beg for me
i don t need your red wine covered sympathy
just another punchline in your
stand up, sit down, lie back, turn round, play dead for me
stand up tragedy


tonight we'll both go m.i.a
in different towns but in similar ways
i've tried my best, best to forget
but i can't, i can't, i can't
tonight we'll scratch each other's face
if it's in the moment no one complains
i've tried my best to move along
but i can't, i can't, i can't

kiss me with your fist, it's alright
wrap your hands around my throat, i won't mind
i'm permanent, now i won't go
i just want to be your shadow

just one more uptempo tune
the suits don't care if their feet aren't blue
are you aware of what's going on
in my heart, my heart, my heart?
those machine gun eyes have fired crystals into me
you're such a violent high
and i'm such a loose cannon, can't you see?

kiss me with your fist, it's alright
wrap your hands around my throat, i won't mind
i'm permanent, now i won't go
i just wanna be your shadow
have a bus drive it over my rib cage
snap my bank cards and throw them at my face
i'm permanent, now i won't go
i just want to be your shadow

and i just want to be sum of your broken parts
and i just want to be your creature of the dark
and i just want to be the sum of your broken parts
and i just want to be your creature of, your creature of the dark
i just want to be your shadow

kiss me with your fist, it's alright
wrap your hands around my throat, i won't mind
i'm permanent, now i won't go
i just want to be your shadow
i just want to be your shadow
i just want to be your shadow


when your legs don't work like they used to before
and i can't sweep you off of your feet
will your mouth still remember the taste of my love?
will your eyes still smile from your cheeks?
and darling, i will be loving you till we're seventy
and baby, my heart could still fall as hard at twenty three
and i'm thinking 'bout how

people fall in love in mysterious ways
maybe just the touch of a hand
well me, i fall in love with you every single day
i just wanna tell you i am

so honey, now, take me into your loving arms
kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
place your head on my beating heart, i'm thinking out loud
and maybe we found love right where we are

when my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
and the crowds don't remember my name
when my hands don't play the strings the same way
i know you will still love me the same
'cause, honey, your soul could never grow old, it's evergreen
and baby, your smile's forever in my mind and memory
and i'm thinking 'bout how

people fall in love in mysterious ways
and maybe it's all part of a plan
well i'll just keep on making the same mistakes
hoping that you'll understand

that, baby, now, take me into your loving arms
kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
place your head on my beating heart, i'm thinking out loud
and maybe we found love right where we are

so baby, now, take me into your loving arms
kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
oh darling, place your head on my beating heart, i'm thinking out loud
that maybe we found love right where we are
oh baby, we found love right where we are
and we found love right where we are

monday finds you like a bomb
it's been left ticking there too long
you're bleeding
some days there's nothing left to learn
from the point of no return
you're leaving
hey, hey, i saved the world today
everybody's happy now
the bad thing's gone away
and everybody's happy now
the good thing's here to stay
please let it stay
there's a million mouths to feed
but i've got everything i need
i'm breathing
and there's a hurting thing inside
but i've got everything to hide
i'm grieving
hey, hey, i saved the world today
and everybody's happy now
the bad thing's gone away
and everybody's happy now
the good thing's here to stay
please let it stay

your life s not caving in yet
surviving but your world's so flat
but at least there's money coming in

and i know, and i know, and i know you ve got it all
it's not right for you
and i know, and i know, and i know you're about to fall
under these lights, you just fell flat from the tree

until you had your house paid off

if you want to i'll take you out
and i got the feeling
that i'm going to keep you up all

shying away
i'll be coming for your love, okay?

take on me  take on me 
take me on  take on me 
i'll be gone
in a day or two

so needless to say
i'm odds and ends
but i'll be stumbling away
slowly learning that life is okay
say after me
it's no better to be safe than sorry

take on me  take on me 
take me on  take on me 
i'll be gone
in a day or two

today is gonna be the day that they're gonna throw it back to you
by now, you should have somehow realised what you gotta do
i don't believe that anybody feels the way i do, about you now

backbeat, the word is on the street that the fire in your heart is out
i'm sure you've heard it all before but you never really had a doubt
i don't believe that anybody feels the way i do, about you now

and all the roads we have to walk are winding
and all the lights that lead us there are blinding
there are many things that i would like to say to you
but i don't know how

because maybe
you're gonna be the one that saves me
and after all
you're my wonderwall

how many sorrows
do you try to hide
in a world of illusion
that's covering your mind?
i'll show you something good
oh, i'll show you something good
when you open your mind
you'll discover the sign
that there's something you're longing to find
the miracle of love
will take away your pain
when the miracle of love
comes your way again
cruel is the night
that covers up your fears
tender is the one
that wipes away your tears
there must be a bitter breeze
to make you sting so viciously
they say the greatest coward
can hurt the most ferociously
but i'll show you something good
oh, i'll show you something good
if you open your heart
you can make a new start
when your crumbling world falls apart
the miracle of love
will take away your pain
when the miracle of love
comes your way again
the miracle of love  must take a miracle 
will take away your pain  must take a miracle

same old city with a different name
men are coming to take me away
i don t know why but i know i can t stay
there s a weight that s pressing down
late at night you can hear the sound
even the noise you make when you sleep
can t swim across a river so deep

they know my name cause i told it to them
but they don t know where
they don t know when it s coming, when it s coming

there s this fear i keep so deep
knew its name since before i could speak, yeah, oh

they know my name cause i told it to them
but they don t know where
they don t know when, it s coming
oh when, that it s coming, keep the car running

if some night i don t come home
please don t think i ve left you alone
the same place animals go when they die
you can t climb across a mountain so high
the same city where i go when i sleep
you can t swim across a river so deep

they know my name cause i told it to them
but they don t know where
they don t know when, it s coming
oh when, is it coming, keep the car running
keep the car running
keep the car running

now your dream has finally been born
black butterfly
sailed across the waters

what the struggle brings
black butterfly
set the skies on fire
rise up even higher
so the ageless winds of time can catch your wings

but your faith was as sure as the stars

and the world has come to see
just how proud and beautiful you are

and send it soaring

so that all of can read it
and remember when we need it
that a dream conceived in truth can never die
butterfly

i can't explain exactly what i'm doing standing in the rain
don't do it for fun
do it if you feel it
kiss it on the tongue
i'm taking my thoughts to a railway station
put 'em on a train just to see what's coming back
what's coming back
it's coming like a heart attack
ice melts too fast
so nothing stays forever nothing's gonna last
she's dressed in black
a black that ends in nowhere and i just got to have her back
and i'm television sick and i'm television crazy
no one works so hard just to make me feel so bad
i'm feeling bad
oh that's too sad
hey. hey. hey. she's as mean as mean
hey. hey. hey. she's as black as black
hey. hey. hey. she's as mean as mean
hey. hey. hey. she's as black as black
hey. hey. hey. i got to get her back
hey. hey. hey. i got to get her back
hey. hey. hey. i got to get her back
hey. hey. hey. she's as mean as mean
hey. hey. hey. she's as sick as sick
hey. hey. hey. she's as cool as cool
hey. hey. hey. she's as black as black

there's fifty two ways to murder anyone
one and two are the same
and they both work as well
i'm coming clean for amy
julie doesn't scream as well
and the cops won't listen all night
and so maybe i'll be over
just as soon as i fill them all in
and i can remember when i saw her last
we were running all around and having a blast, having a blast
but the back seat of the drive in
is so lonely without you
i know when you're home
i was thinking about you
there was something i forgot to say
i was crying on saturday night
i was out cruising without you
they were playing our song
crying on saturday night
as the moon becomes the night time
you go viciously, quietly, away
i'm sitting in the bedroom
where we used to sit and smoke cigarettes
now i'm watching, watching you die
i can remember when i saw her last
we were running all around and having a blast
but the back seat of the drive in
is so lonely without you
i know when you're home
i was thinking about you
there was something i forgot to say
i was crying on saturday night
i was out cruising without you
they were playing our song
crying on saturday night
crying on saturday night
crying on saturday night


record this? 
you are no exception
there are no reruns
justify your reasons
now it is my turn
we are the wolves 

how s it gonna feel when there s no one to support ya?
how s it gonna feel when you re standing there alone?
you are no exception
there are no reruns
justify your reasons
now it is my turn

your fits of paranoia
drive your every whim
well have you seen her?
this indelible creature
this is the point we have the choice to be happy together

we have achieved so much more
than you possibly thought we could
love that you re seething
you can achieve anything
just remember, no "i" in team
there s two in brilliant
we are the wolves of winter
we live in a kingdom of blood

when you gonna rise, seek a man you can dispose of?
when you gonna try to boil my last bone?
this is true obsession
take me and my worth
subtle as a steam burn
more than just a scald

you stink of hallelujah
but you wash yourself in sin
well have you seen her?
this heavenly creature
this is the point we have the choice to survive the winter

we have achieved so much more
than you possibly thought we could
love that you re seething
you can achieve anything
just remember, no "i" in team
there s two in brilliant
we are the wolves of winter
we live in a kingdom of blood


we are the wolves of winter
we live in a kingdom of blood

so much for the golden future, i can't even start

"the test begins... now "
i thought i was smart
i thought i was right
i thought it better not to fight
i thought there was a virtue in always being cool
so when it came time to fight
i thought i'll just step aside
and that time would prove you wrong
and that you would be the fool
i don't know where the sun beams end
and the starlights begin
it's all a mystery
oh, to fight is to defend
if it's not now, then tell me when would be the time that you would stand up and be a man?
for to lose i could accept
but to surrender i just wept and regretted this moment
oh, that i, i was the fool
i don't know where the sun beams end
and the starlights begin
it's all a mystery
and i don't know how a man decides
what's right for his own life
it's all a mystery
because i'm a man, not a boy
and there are things you can't avoid
you have to face them when you're not prepared to face them
if i could, i would
but you're with him now, it'd do no good
i should have fought him
but instead i let him, i let him take you
 chorus 
"the test is over... now "


and i feel that time's a wasted go
so where ya goin' 'til tomorrow?
and i see that these are lies to come
so would you even care?

and i feel it
and i feel it

where ya goin' for tomorrow?
where ya goin' with the mask i found?
and i feel, and i feel when the dogs begin to smell her
will she smell alone?

and i feel, so much depends on the weather
so is it rainin' in your bedroom?
and i see, that these are the eyes of disarray
so would you even care?

and i feel it
and she feels it

where ya goin' for tomorrow?
where ya goin' with the mask i found?
and i feel, and i feel when the dogs begin to smell her
will she smell alone?

when the dogs do find her
got time, time, to wait for tomorrow
to find it, to find it, to find it
when the dogs do find her
got time, time, to wait for tomorrow
to find it, to find it, to find it

where ya goin' for tomorrow?
where ya goin' with the mask i found?
and i feel, and i feel when the dogs begin to smell her
will she smell alone?

when the dogs do find her
got time, time, to wait for tomorrow
to find it, to find it, to find it
when the dogs do find her
got time, time, to wait for tomorrow
to find it, to find it, to find it
to find it
to find it
to find it


well i got a candle, and i've got a spoon
i live in a hallway with no doors, and no rooms
and under the window sill, they all were found
a touch of concrete within a doorway, without a sound

someone save me if you will
and take away, all these pills
and please just save me, if you can
from my blasphemy, in my wasteland

how did i get here, and what went wrong
couldn't handle forgiveness, now i'm far, beyond gone
and i can hardly remember, the look of my own eyes
how could i love this, my life's so dishonest, it made me compromise

someone save me if you will
and take away, all these pills
and please just save me, if you can
from my blasphemy in my wasteland

jump in the water
jump in with me
jump on the altar
lay down with me
the hardest question, to answer
is why, why

someone save me if you will
and take away, all these pills
and please just save me, if you can
from my blasphemy in my wasteland

somebody save me
somebody save me
somebody save me
somebody save me
somebody save me
please don't erase me


my circuits have blown
i know it's self imposed
and all i have shared, and all i have loved
is all i'll ever own
but something has changed
i feel so alive
my life just blew up, i'd give it all up
i'll depressurize

oh, oh, oh, ten thousand miles left on the road
oh, oh, oh, five hundred hours 'til i am home

i need something human, human
human, human

let's face all our fears
and come out of the shadle
let's burn all the money, absolve all the lies
and wake up unscathed
the big picture's gone
replaced with visions of you
now life can begin, i've cleansed all my sins
i'm about to break through

oh, oh, oh, five thousand miles left on the road
oh, oh, oh, two hundred hours 'tll i am home

i need something human, human
human, human

and i need the touch
and something human, human

ah ah ah ah ah
less than a mile left on the road
ah ah ah ah ah
i will be crawling though your door
i need something human, human
human, human

and i need your love
and something human, human


she had something to confess to
but you don't have the time, so
look the other way
you will wait until it's over
to reveal what you'd never shown her
too little much too late

too long trying to resist it
you've just gone and missed it
it's escaped your world

can you see that i am needing
begging for so much more
than you could ever give?
and i don't want you to adore me
don't want you to ignore me
when it pleases you
and i'll do it on my own

i have played in every toilet
but you still want to spoil it
to prove i've made a big mistake

too long trying to resist it
you've just gone and missed it
it's escaped your world

can you see that i am needing
begging for so much more
than you could ever give?
and i don't want you to adore me
don't want you to ignore me
when it pleases you
and i'll do it on my own

meeting you with a view to a kill
face to face in secret places, feel the chill
nightfall covers me, but you know the plans i'm making
still overseas, could it be the whole earth opening wide
a sacred why, a mystery gaping inside
a week is why, until we...

dance into the fire
that fatal kiss is all we need
dance into the fire
to fatal sounds of broken dreams
dance into the fire
that fatal kiss is all we need
dance into the fire

the choice for you is the view to a kill
between the shades assassination standing still
earth's crystal tears, the fall of snowflakes on your body
first time in years to drench your skin in lover's rosy stain
a chance to find the phoenix for the flame
a chance to die, but can we...

dance into the fire
that fatal kiss is all we need
dance into the fire
to fatal sounds of broken dreams
dance into the fire
that fatal kiss is all we need
dance into the fire
when all we see is the view to a kill


not everyone can be like me and michael
the only problem is forgetting which side you're on
so you think the burning light will reappear on summer nights
like all the rest, but they can't find out

in every scene, it's me and michael
imaginary bombs, raining down from the clouds
so it seems, the danger signs will never let the feelings die
when all the best and brightest have gone

me and michael
solid as they come
me and michael
it's not a question now
me and michael
solid as they come
me and michael
it's not a question now
me and michael

binary star, sink like the setting sun
too happy with ourselves to notice when the change had come
so you think the losing side would never break dividing lines
but sanctity wasn't in doubt

me and michael
solid as they come
me and michael
it's not a question now
it's me and michael
solid as they come
me and michael
it's not a question now
me and michael


when the roll is called up yonder
i hope you see me there
it's in the water, it's where you came from
it's in the water, it's where you came from
when the crowd begins to wonder
and they cry to see your face

it's in the water, it's in the story, of where you came from
your sons and daughters, in all their glory, it's going to shape her
and when they clash and come together, and start rising
just drink the water where you came from, where you came from

so the roll it was called from yonder
never sold yourself away

it's in the water, it's in the story, of where you came from
your sons and daughters, in all their glory, it's going to shape her
and when they clash and come together, and start rising
just drink the water where you came from, where you came from

it's in the water, it's where you came from
it's in the water, it's where you came from
and when they clash and come together, and start rising
just drink the water, where you came from, where you came from


we were lyin' down
our bodies were bound
by the sun rays
up and around
the coffee got ground
it was a sunday
went out on the grass
i heard you ask
if i'd play
so i strummed your strings
you started to sing
it was a good say

it was a good day
after a long night
it was a good day
i sang the song right
it was a good day
to see the sunlight
it was a good day
to have a good night

we were lyin' down
our bodies were bound
we were wound tight
your chest rose and fell
your breath cast a spell
sounded just right
went down on the street
i heard the shuffle of feet
movin' through the moonlight
i heard someone shout
somethin' about
how it was a good night

it was a good day
after a long night
it was a good day
to hear the song play
it went the right way
we fought the good fight
it was a long day
it was a good night


well, i don't want to wake up in the morning
but i've got to face the day
that's what all the friends i do not like as much as you say
i don't want to do things independently
but i can't make you stay
that's what all the friends i do not like as much as you say

but if you wanna come back it's alright, it's alright
it's alright if you wanna come back
do you wanna come back? it's alright, it's alright
it's alright if you wanna come back to me

well, i don't want to see you with another guy
but the fact is that i may
that's what all the friends i do not like as much as you say
"well, give it just another couple months or so
then you'll be okay."
that's what all the friends i do not like as much as you say

alone, all alone
i am on my own
alone, all alone
i am on my own

but if you wanna come back it's alright, it's alright
it's alright if you wanna come back
do you wanna come back? it's alright, it's alright
it's alright if you wanna come back to me
but if you wanna come back it's alright, it's alright
it's alright if you wanna come back
do you wanna come back? it's alright, it's alright
it's alright if you wanna come back to me
do you wanna come back? it's alright, it's alright
it's alright if you wanna come back

'twas down in mississippi no so long ago
when a young boy from chicago town stepped through a southern door
this boy's dreadful tragedy i can still remember well
the color of his skin was black and his name was emmett till

some men they dragged him to a barn and there they beat him up
they said they had a reason, but i can't remember what
they tortured him and did some things too evil to repeat
there was screaming sounds inside the barn, there was laughing sounds out on the street

then they rolled his body down a gulf amidst a bloody red rain
and they threw him in the waters wide to cease his screaming pain
the reason that they killed him there, and i'm sure it ain't no lie
was just for the fun of killing' him and to watch him slowly die

and then to stop, the united states of yelling for a trial
two brothers they confessed that they had killed poor emmett till
but on the jury there were men who helped the brothers commit this awful crime
and so this trial was a mockery, but nobody there seemed to mind

i saw the morning papers but i could not bear, to see
the smiling brothers walking' down the courthouse stairs
for the jury found them innocent and the brothers they went free
while emmett's body floats the foam of a jim crow southern sea

if you can't speak out against this kind of thing, a crime that's so unjust
your eyes are filled with dead men's dirt, your mind is filled with dust
your arms and legs they must be in shackles and chains, and your blood it must refuse to flow
for you to let this human race fall down so god awful low 

this song's just a reminder to remind your fellow man
that this kind of thing still lives today in that ghost robed ku klux klan
but if all of us folks that thinks alike, if we gave all we could give
we could make this great land of ours a greater place to live

perhaps it is the color of the sun cut flat
and covering the crossroads i'm standing at
or maybe it's the weather or something like that
but mama , you been on my mind
i mean no trouble, please don't put me down, don't get upset
i am not pleading or saying i can't forget you
i do not pace the floor bowed down and bent, but yet
mama, you been on my mind
even though my eyes are hazy and my thoughts they might be narrow
where you been don't bother me or bring me down in sorrow
i don't even mind who you be waking with tomorrow
but mama, you've been on my mind
i am not askin' you to say words like "yes" or "no,"
please understand me, i have no place i'm calling you to go
i'm just whispering to myself so i can pretend that i don't know
mama, you been on my mind
when you wake up in the morning, baby, look inside your mirror
you know i won't be next to you, you know i won't be near
i'd just be curious to know if you can see yourself as clear
as someone who has had you on his mind

when she said, "don't waste your words, they're just lies"
i cried she was deaf
and she worked on my face until breaking my eyes
and what else you got left
it was then that i got up to leave
but she said, "don't forget
everybody must give something back
for something they get"
i stood there and hummed, i tapped on her drum
i asked her how come
and she buttoned her boot and straightened her suit
then she said, "don't get cute"
so, i forced my hands in my pockets
and felt with my thumbs
and gallantly handed her
my very last piece of gum
she threw me outside, i stood in the dirt
where everyone walked
and after finding that i forgotten my shirt
i went back and knocked
i waited in the hallway, she went to get it
and i tried to make sense
out of that picture of you in your wheelchair
that leaned up against
her jamaican rum and when she did come
i asked her for some
she said, "no, dear", i said, "your words aren't clear
you'd better spit out your gum"
she screamed till her face got so red
then she fell on the floor
and i covered her up and then
thought i'd go look through her drawer
and when i was through i filled up my shoe
and brought it to you
and you, you took me in, you loved me then
you never wasted time
and i, i never took much
i never asked for your crutch
now, don't ask for mine


brian, top marks for not trying
so kind of you to bless us with your effortlessness
we're grateful and so strangely comforted
and i wonder, are you putting us under?
'cause we can't take our eyes off the t shirt and ties combination
well, see you later, innovator

some want to kiss, some want to kick you
there's not a net that you couldn't slip through
or at least that's the impression i get
'cause you're smooth and you're wet
and she's not aware yet, but she's yours
she'll be saying, "use me, show me the jacuzzi"
i imagine that it's there on a plate, your whole rendezvous rate
means that you'll never be frightened to make 'em wait for a while
i doubt it's your style not to get what you set out to acquire
the eyes are on fire, you are the unforecasted storm

 brian  calm, collected and commanding
 top marks for not trying  you leave the other story standing
with your renditions and jokes, bet there's hundreds of blokes
that have wept 'cause you've stolen their thunder
are you putting us under?
'cause we can't take our eyes off the t shirt and ties combination
well, see you later, innovator

have you noticed? i've never been impressed
by your friends from new york and london
i'll level accusations like the press
'til you realise that you've dressed yourself in tatters
because a man's needs, man's needs
are found on greed, are found on greed
a man's needs, man's needs
are lost on me
a man's needs, man's needs
are found on greed, are found on greed
a man's needs
i'm not bothered, what you say or how you dress
i'm a mess, so you've always seemed inviting
but really, this all seems quite meaningless
and i remember that you never seem to see...
the fact that man's needs, man's needs
are found on greed, are found on greed
a man's needs, man's needs
are lost on me
a girl's needs, girl's needs
just don't agree, just don't agree
with a man's needs
have you noticed? i've never been impressed
by your friends from new york and london
but really, this all seems quite meaningless
when i remember that you never seem to see...
the excuse that man's needs, man's needs
are found on greed, are found on greed
a man's needs, man's needs
are lost on me
you say a man's needs, man's needs
apply to me, i don't agree
a man's needs...


just a small town girl
living in a lonely world
she took the midnight train
going anywhere

just a city boy
born and raised in south detroit
he took the midnight train
going anywhere

a singer in a smoky room
a smell of wine and cheap perfume
for a smile they can share the night
it goes on and on and on and on

strangers waiting
up and down the boulevard
their shadows searching in the night
streetlights, people
living just to find emotion
hiding somewhere in the night

working hard to get my fill
everybody wants a thrill
payin' anything to roll the dice
just one more time

some will win, some will lose
some were born to sing the blues
oh, the movie never ends
it goes on and on and on and on

strangers waiting
up and down the boulevard
their shadows searching in the night
streetlights, people
living just to find emotion
hiding somewhere in the night


don't stop believin'
hold on to that feeling
streetlights, people
ohohohhhhhhhhhh
don't stop believin'
hold on
streetlights, people
ohohohhhhhhhhhh
don't stop believin'
hold on to that feeling
streetlights, people
ohohohhhhhhhhhh


run away from this god forsaken place
and hide away from everybody's prying face
you told deborah that he is the one
you're going to quit debenhams
elope and get married in the sun

have you really thought this through?
is he really the one for you?
why are you so in love with

you linger on a feeling

reminiscent of a summer in the isle of wight
but you think that it's too late
to back out at this stage
you need to emancipate
step back and disengage

i don't know if he'd stay or if he be on his pedalo
cramping from the frantic pace
you told alison next door
that all your dreams were made
but then your home screen flashed some more
he never was one for serenade

hold on tight, you've got a way to go
you're terrified by the open road
in a daze, you've lost control
you've found a gang
and it makes you feel better than the other girls

and you pray they're just boys, they're not villains
one's got religious tattoos, he'll be forgiven

let go, there is nothing more to hide
seeing life through closed eyes
it's just a young understanding
you know, that time is on your side
seeing life through closed eyes
it's just a young understanding

cruising round in a friend's new car
you've always know they won't get you far
found yourself on a downward slope
it's ok, cause it makes you feel better than the other girls

and you pray they're just boys, they're not villains
one's got religious tattoos, he'll be forgiven

let go, there is nothing more to hide
seeing life through closed eyes
it's just a young understanding
you know, that time is on your side
seeing life through closed eyes
it's just a young understanding

torn apart, can't you see?
they left their hearts in the 70's
reach for a sign, reach for an understanding
reach for a sign, reach for an understanding
reach for a sign, reach for an understanding
reach for a sign, reach for an understanding

let go, there is nothing more to hide
seeing life through closed eyes
it's just a young understanding
you know, that time is on your side
seeing life through closed eyes
it's just a young understanding

reach for a sign
it's just a young understanding
reach for a sign

there you are dancing at your altar
beautiful earthling, dressed in kashmir
all of your sound echoes through the canyons
down below they're dreaming
hear the sirens screaming
another time, another world
girls were boys and boys were girls
find the glitter in the litter
like a haunt, it's got to move
everybody needs some room
there's something out there

there's a long straight road
out of the cold
and we can leave it all behind
i wanna get outside
baby, let's get outside
i wanna get outside, outside   of me

oh, i found the space between the spaces
standing in the nothing, and time reclaims you
and as the wind will beat you down
and the wind the only sound
there's something out there

there's a long straight road
out of the cold
and we can leave it all behind
i wanna get outside
baby, let's get outside
i wanna get outside, outside   of me


there's a long straight road
out of the cold
and we can leave it all behind
i wanna get outside
baby, let's get outside
i wanna get outside, outside   of me


cut me off from the rest of the world
it's my addiction
it turns me on
it's oh so quiet at my end of the world
ban all the music
it's all gone wrong

this is, this is it
they're tryn'a take it from me
got this, this is it
won't let them take it from me
play an illegal song
and turn it up louder
play an illegal song
and turn it up louder

there's a buzz in the air, i've been told
it's my affliction
been sick so long
switching off all the noise i've been sold
ban all the music
it's all gone wrong

this is, this is it
they're tryn'a take it from me
got this, this is it
won't let them take it from me

who's got a match? i've got the petrol to set it to
i know i shouldn't have trusted you
it's making me tense what you're telling me
a series of facts that don't compute the classic way
i guess i'm wrong again anyway

i'm a fire and i burn, burn, burn tonight 
i'm a fire and i burn, burn, burn tonight

twenty roads too late
when you get down the hill
push your feet into the ground
remember we were here
when you get back
remember we were never found
were never found

all the things we've done
like comfort slipping away
in the woods we will remain

save yourself
confront the darkness
safe but lost on the way

i have loved you
with more than niceness
when my dog fails me
i'll bid him goodbye
 held you closer, wish i

yeah, she's built for speed like a black castrum doloris
good for the needy, like nietzsche, freud and horace
but i'm skinflint, broke, makin' no money, makin' jokes
but baby, i won't joke with you
my feet are burnin' like a roman hypocaust
but the romans are gone, they changed their name because they lost
she writes letters like a jack chick comic
just a buncha' propaganda, make my fingers histrionic;
like this, and this
i mean, she's my baby
but she makes me get avuncular
and when my monkey is jumpin'
i got no time to make it up to her
i fantasize about the hospital
the army, asylum, confinement in prison
any place where there's a cot to clear my vision
i spit it out
whatever's in my mouth
just like that black bat licorice
yeah, that black bat licorice
that black bat licorice
that black bat licorice
yeah
i wanna cut out my tongue and let ya' hold onto it for me
'cause without my skill to amplify my sounds it might get boring
i've got the wit of the staircase with atomic clock precision
and the phases of the moon directin' all of my decisions like this
when i need to know, i play dumb like columbo
and get my feelin's hurt and move to ny like i'm dumbo
don't you want to lose the part of the brain that has opinions?
to not even know what you are doing, or care about yourself or your species in the billions
yeah, i have to spit it out
ah, whatever's in my mouth
ah, i have to spit it out  behave yourself 
just like that black bat licorice
that black bat licorice
that black bat licorice, i never liked it, i never will
now state the same damn thing with the violin
whatever you feed me
i feed you right back
but it will do no good


all aboard  hahahahahahahaaaa 
ay  ay ay ay ay ay ay 

crazy, but that's how it goes
millions of people living as foes
maybe it's not too late
to learn how to love and forget how to hate

mental wounds not healing
life's a bitter shame

i'm going off the rails on a crazy train
i'm going off the rails on a crazy train

let's go  i've listened to preachers, i've listened to fools
i've watched all the dropouts who make their own rules
one person conditioned to rule and control
the media sells it and you live the role

mental wounds still screaming
driving me insane

i'm going off the rails on a crazy train
i'm going off the rails on a crazy train

i know that things are going wrong for me
you gotta listen to my words, yeah, yeah 


heirs of a cold war, that's what we've become
inheriting troubles, i'm mentally numb
crazy, i just cannot bear
i'm living with something' that just isn't fair

mental wounds not healing
who and what's to blame?

i'm going off the rails on a crazy train
i'm going off the rails on a crazy train

 crank the music up... 

bring that shit in
ugh
yeah, the movement's in motion with mass militant poetry
now check this out
ugh
in the right light, study becomes insight
but the system that dissed us, teaches us to read and write
so called facts are fraud
they want us to allege and pledge and bow down to their god
lost the culture, the culture lost
spun our minds and through time, ignorance has taken over
yo, we gotta take the power back 
bam  here's the plan
motherfuck uncle sam, step back i know who i am
raise up your ear, i'll drop the style and clear
it's the beats and the lyrics they fear 
the rage is relentless
we need a movement with a quickness
you are the witness of change and to counteract...
we gotta take the power back

yeah, we gotta take the power back 
c'mon, c'mon
we gotta take the power back 

the present curriculum, i put my fist in 'em
eurocentric, every last one of 'em
see right through the red, white, and blue disguise
with lecture i puncture the structure of lies
installed in our minds and attempting to hold us back
we've got to take it back
cause holes in our spirit causing tears and fears
one sided stories for years and years and years
i'm inferior?
who's inferior?
yeah we need to check the interior
of the system that cares about only one culture
and that, is why we gotta take the power back

yeah, we gotta take the power back 
c'mon, c'mon
we gotta take the power back 
ayo check, we're gonna have to break it, break it, break it down
aw shit

and like this, ugh
c'mon
yeah
bring it back the other way
ugh

the teacher stands in front of the class
but the lesson plan he can't recall
the student's eyes don't perceive the lies
bouncing off every fucking wall
his composure is well kept
i guess he fears playing the fool
the complacent students sit
and listen to some of that bullshit that he learned in school
europe ain't my rope to swing on
can't learn a thing from it, yet we hang from it 
 gotta get it, gotta get it together then
like the motherfuckin weathermen 
to expose and close the doors on those who try
to strangle and mangle the truth
cause the circle of hatred continues unless we react
we gotta take the power back 

yeah, we gotta take the power back 
c'mon, c'mon
we gotta take the power back 
no more lies
no more lies
no more lies
no more lies
no more lies
no more lies
no more lies
no more lies 
ugh

yeah  
take it back y'all 
take it back, a take it back
a take it back y'all  c'mon 
take it back y'all 
take it back, a take it back
a take it back y'all  c'mon 
ugh 
yeah 

i should have known better
than to let you go alone
it's times like these
i can't make it on my own
wasted days and sleepless nights
and i can't wait to see you again
i find i spend my time
waiting on your call
how can i tell you, babe
my back's against the wall
i need you by my side
so tell me it's alright
? cos i don't think
i can take anymore
is this love that i'm feeling

that i've been searching for
is this love or am i dreaming
this must be love
? cos it really got a hold on me
a hold on me
i can't stop the feeling
i've been this way before
but with you i've found the key
to open any door
i can feel my love for you
growing stronger day by day
and i can't wait to see you again
so i can hold you in my arms
is this love that i'm feeling
is this the love
that i've been searching for

in my defence all my intentions were good
and heaven holds a place somewhere for the misunderstood
you know i'd give you blood if it'd be enough
devils on my doorstep since the day i was born
it's hard to find a sunset in the eye of a storm
but i'm a dreamer by design and i know in time we'll put this behind

for what it's worth i'm sorry for the hurt
i'll be the first to say, "i made my own mistakes"
for what it's worth i know it's just a word and words betray
sometimes we lose our way
for what it's worth

behind the lens is a poison picture you paint
and lets not pretend you were ever searching for saints
'cause i've been crucified for just being alive
somewhere in the crossfire of this whispering war
seems that i've forgot just what i was fighting for
but underneath my skin there's a fire within
still burning

for what it's worth i'm sorry for the hurt
i'll be the first to say, "i made my own mistakes"
for what it's worth i know it's just a word and words betray
sometimes we lose our way
for what it's worth

the first bird to fly gets all the arrows
let's leave the past behind with all our sorrows
i'll build a bridge between us and i'll swallow my pride

for what it's worth i'm sorry for the hurt
i'll be the first to say, "i made my own mistakes"
for what it's worth i know it's just a word and words betray
sometimes we lose our way
for what it's worth

i'm goin' down to the greyhound station
gonna get a ticket to ride
gonna find that lady with two or three kids
and sit down by her side
ride 'til the sun comes up and down around me
'bout two or three times
smokin' cigarettes in the last seat
tryin' to hide my sorrow from the people i meet
and get along with it all
go down where the people say "y'all"
sing a song with a friend
change the shape that i'm in
and get back in the game
and start playin' again
i'd like to stay but i might have to go to start over again
might go back down to texas
might go to somewhere that i've never been
and get up in the mornin' and go out at night
and i won't have to go home
get used to bein' alone
change the words to this song
start singin' again
i'm tired of runnin' 'round lookin' for answers
to questions that i already know
i could build me a castle of memories
just to have somewhere to go
count the days and the nights that it takes
to get back in the saddle again
feed the pigeons some clay
turn the night into day
start talkin' again, when i know what to say
i'm goin' down to the greyhound station
gonna get a ticket to ride
gonna find that lady with two or three kids
and sit down by her side
ride 'til the sun comes up and down around me
'bout two or three times
smokin' cigarettes in the last seat
tryin' to hide my sorrow from the people i meet

when i know what to say


stayed in bed all morning just to pass the time
there's something wrong here, there can be no denying
one of us is changing
or maybe we just stopped trying

and it's too late, baby, now it's too late
though we really did try to make it
something inside has died
and i can't hide and i just can't fake it
oh no no no no  no no, no no 

it used to be so easy living here with you
you were light and breezy and i knew just what to do
now you look so unhappy and i feel like a fool

and it's too late, baby, now it's too late
though we really did try to make it  we can't make it 
something inside has died
and i can't hide and i just can't fake it
ohhhh, nooo no
 instrumental

there'll be good times again for me and you
but we just can't stay together, don't you feel it, too
still i'm glad for what we had and how i once loved you

but it's too late, baby, now it's too late
though we really did try to make it  we can't make it 
something inside has died and i can't hide
and i just can't fake it
ohhhh, nooo no no no no

whenever i see your smiling face
i have to smile myself
because i love you  yes, i do 
and when you give me that pretty little pout
it turns me inside out
there's something about you, baby  i don't know 

isn't it amazing a man like me
can feel this way
tell me how much longer
it will grow stronger every day
oh, how much longer

i thought i was in love
a couple of times before
with the girl next door
but that was long before i met you
now i'm sure that i won't forget you
and i thank my lucky stars
that you are who you are
and not just another lovely lady
sent down to break my heart

isn't it amazing a man like me
can feel this way
tell me how much longer
it will grow stronger every day
oh, how much longer

no one can tell me that i'm doing wrong today
whenever i see you smile at me
no one can tell me that, tell me that i'm doing wrong today
whenever i see your smiling face my way
no one can tell me that i'm doing wrong today
no one can tell me that i'm doing wrong today, no no darling
no no, darling, no no, yeah yeah
no one can tell me that i'm doing wrong today


it's not in the way that you hold me
it's not in the way you say you care
it's not in the way you've been treating my friends
it's not in the way that you stayed till the end
it's not in the way you look or the things that you say that you'll do

hold the line
love isn't always on time
hold the line
love isn't always on time

it's not in the words that you told me
it's not in the way you say you're mine
it's not in the way that you came back to me
it's not in the way that your love set me free
it's not in the way you look or the things that you say that you'll do

hold the line
love isn't always on time
hold the line
love isn't always on time


it's not in the words that you told me
it's not in the way you say you're mine
it's not in the way that you came back to me
it's not in the way that your love set me free
it's not in the way you look or the things that you say that you'll do

i saw you staring out of your own abyss again
waiting for something you're not sure even still exists
don't be afraid to wonder, don't be afraid to be scared
it should never be a prison
so i apologise if you feel something
but love is all we have, feel something  amo 
or if i steal something, please, remember it was mine
feel something,  ah, ah, ah, amo 

when it's not always raining
there'll be days like this
when there's no one complaining
there'll be days like this
when everything falls into place
like the flick of a switch
well my mama told me
there'll be days like this
when you don't need to worry
there'll be days like this
when no one's in a hurry
there'll be days like this
when all the parts of the puzzle
start to look like they fit
then i must remember
there'll be days like this
when you don't need an answer
there'll be days like this
when you don't meet a chancer
there'll be days like this
when you don't get betrayed
by that old judas kiss
oh my mama told me
there'll be days like this
when everyone is up front
and they're not playing tricks
when you don't have no freeloaders
out to get their kicks
when it's nobody's business
the way that you want to live
i just have to remember
there'll be days like this
when no one steps on my dreams
there'll be days like this
when people understand what i mean
there'll be days like this
when you ring out the changes
of how everything is
well my mama told me
there'll be days like this
oh my mama told me
there'll be days like this
oh my mama told me
there'll be days like this
oh my mama told me
there'll be days like this
oh my mama told me
there'll be days like this


show yourself
show yourself
i want to see everything you're made of
tear it down and rip it out
shed your skin and float it down the river
lose yourself
lose yourself
wild horses ride you through the valley
come alive
come alive
sail into the void without your worries

you're not as safe as far as i can tell
and i can tell
only you can save yourself
soon this will all be a distant memory
or could this dream be real at all?

stars align
stars align
stars can fall and get you into trouble
be afraid
don't be afraid
speak the ancient wisdom of the desert

you're not as safe as far as i can tell
and i can tell
only you can save yourself
soon this will all be a distant memory
or could this dream be real at all?

show yourself
show yourself
i wanna see everything you're made of
reveal yourself
reveal yourself
the truth will send a ripple through your body
see your fate
you'll see your fate
death will come and steal you from the living
dead and gone
dead and gone
i'll see you on the other side of fire

she can kill with a smile, she can wound with her eyes
she can ruin your faith with her casual lies
and she only reveals what she wants you to see
she hides like a child but she's always a woman to me
she can lead you to love, she can take you or leave you
she can ask for the truth but she'll never believe you
and she'll take what you give her as long as it's free
yeah she steals like a thief but she's always a woman to me
oh, she takes care of herself, she can wait if she wants
she's ahead of her time
oh, and she never gives out and she never gives in
she just changes her mind
and she'll promise you more than the garden of eden
then she'll carelessly cut you and laugh while you're bleeding
but she'll bring out the best and the worst you can be
blame it all on yourself cause she's always a woman to me
mmm
mmm
oh, she takes care of herself, she can wait if she wants
she's ahead of her time
oh, and she never gives out and she never gives in
she just changes her mind
she is frequently kind and she's suddenly cruel
she can do as she pleases, she's nobody's fool
but she can't be convicted, she's earned her degree
and the most she will do is throw shadows at you
but she's always a woman to me
mmm
mmm


even though it's been so long
my love for you keeps going strong
i remember the things that we used to do
a kiss in the rain till the sun shine through
i tried to deny it but i'm still in love with you

i miss you like crazy, i miss you like crazy
ever since you went away, every hour of every day
i miss you like crazy, i miss you like crazy

i can see the love shining in your eyes
and it comes as such a sweet surprise
if seeing's believing it's worth the wait
so hold me and tell me it's not too late
we're so good together, we're starting forever now

and i miss you like crazy, i miss you like crazy
ever since you went away, every hour of every day
i miss you like crazy, i miss you baby
a love like ours will never end
just touch me and we're there again

just one night
and we'll have that magic feeling like we used to do
hold on tight
and whatever comes our way we're gonna make it through
if seeing's believing it's worth the wait
so hold me and tell me it's not too late
we're so good together, we're starting forever now

well i see you standing there like a rabid dog
and you got those crying eyes
makes me want to surrender and wrap you in my arms
you know i try to live without regrets
i'm always moving forward and not looking back
but i tend to leave a trail of dead, while i'm moving ahead
so i'm stepping away
cause i got nothing to say

feels like, feels like it s coming
it feels like, feels
it s like a coming of age
feels like, feels like it s coming
it feels like, feels like a coming of age

and when my fear pulls me out to sea
and the stars are hidden by my pride and my enemies
i seem to hurt the people that care the most
just like an animal i protect my pride
when i'm too bruised to fight
and even when i'm wrong i tend to think i'm right

well i m bored of the game
and too tired to rage

feels like, feels like it s coming
it feels like, feels
it s like a coming of age
feels like, feels like it s coming
it feels like, feels like a coming of age
and i'm burning the page

feels like, feels like it s coming
it feels like, feels
it s like a coming of age
feels like, feels like it s coming
it feels like, feels like a coming of age


feels like, feels like it s coming
it feels like, feels
yeah, it s like a coming of age
feels like, feels like it s coming
it feels like, feels like a coming
feels like, feels like it s coming of age
feels like, feels like it s coming
feels like, feels like it s coming
uuuuh uuuuh

it's times like these when i'm on my way out of the woods
never felt better than when i'm on my way out for good
it's times like these when i'm on my way back out of the woods
i'll never be afraid again now i'm out of here for good
it was just a dream
the most beautiful place i've seen
the white caps and the pines
ripped our nations in the sea
it's times like these when i'm on my way back out of the woods
i've never felt better than when i'm on my way out for good
now i've finally found
all my friends are in the clouds
alone now, in my head now
all alone now, in my head
it's times like these when i'm on my way back out of the woods
i've never felt better than when i'm on my way out for good
now i've finally found
all my friends are in the clouds
alone now, in my head now
all alone now, in your head
and i've waited just so long
to sing you this final song
time keeps ticking, time keeps pushing, time keeps rolling along


which of the witches do you belong?
the one with the eyepatch, or the one who's highly strung?
i know you can't trust anyone
how do you capture your photograph?
put it to sleep, pretend you're having a laugh
i know you thought you'd have the last

i'm a fire and i burn, burn, burn tonight 
i'm a fire and i burn, burn, burn tonight 
i'm a fire and i burn, burn, burn tonight 
i'm a fire and i burn, burn, burn tonight 

the midget is frigid, i put it to you
who's got a match? i've got the petrol to set it to
i know i shouldn't have trusted you
it's making me tense what you're telling me
a series of facts that don't compute the classic way
i guess i'm wrong again anyway

i'm a fire and i burn, burn, burn tonight 
i'm a fire and i burn, burn, burn tonight 
i'm a fire and i burn, burn, burn tonight 
i'm a fire and i burn, burn, burn tonight 
i'm a fire and i burn tonight
i'm a fire 
i'm a fire and i burn tonight
i'm a fire 
i'm a fire, and i burn, burn 
i'm a fire, and i burn, burn 
i'm a fire, and i burn, burn 
i'm a fire, and i burn, burn 
i'm a fire, and i burn, burn 
i'm a fire, and i burn, burn 
i'm a fire, i'm a fire, i'm a fire 


stay in the shadows
cheer at the gallows
this is a round up
this is a low flying panic attack
sing the song on the jukebox that goes

burn the witch
burn the witch
we know where you live

red crosses on wooden doors
if you float, you burn
loose talk around tables
abandon all reason
avoid all eye contact
do not react
shoot the messengers
this is a low flying panic attack
sing the song of sixpence that goes

burn the witch
burn the witch
we know where you live
we know where you live

and said, "thumbs up, they re okay."

 hard to chase away 
 it s hard to chase away 


one for the road, oooh oooh
one for the road, oooh oooh

from the bottom of your heart
the relegation zone
i saw this comin' from the start
the shake, rattle and roll
the cracks in blackout blinds
cast patterns on the ceiling
but you're feeling fine
i thought it was dark outside
i thought it was dark outside

one for the road
so we all get back to yours
and you sit and talk to me on the floor
there's no need to show me 'round, baby
i feel like i've been here before
i've been wonderin' whether later
when you tell everybody to go
will you pour me one for the road?

i knew this would be on the cards
i knew you wouldn't fold
i saw this comin' from the start
the shake, rattle and roll

one for the road
so we all get back to yours
and you sit and talk to me on the floor
there's no need to show me 'round, baby
i feel like i've been here before
i've been wonderin' whether later
when you tell everybody to go
will you pour me one for the road?

the mixture hits you hard
don't get that sinking feeling
don't fall apart
some out of tune guitar
soundtrack to disaster
oooh oooh, one for the road
oooh oooh, one for the road
oooh oooh, one for the road
oooh oooh, one for the road

i'm sitting on the roof of my house
with a shotgun
and a six pack of beers
six pack of beers, six pack of beers

the newscaster says "the enemy's among us"
as bombs explode on the 30 bus
kill your middle class indecision
now is not the time for liberal thought

so i go hunting for witches
i go hunting for witches
heads are going to roll
i go hunting for

90's, optimistic as a teen
now it's terror
airplanes crash into towers
into towers, into towers

the daily mail says "the enemy's among us
taking our women and taking our jobs"
all reasonable thought is being drowned out
by the non stop baying, baying, baying for blood

so i go hunting for witches
i go hunting for witches
heads are going to roll
i go hunting for

i was an ordinary man with ordinary desires
i watched tv, it informed me
i was an ordinary man with ordinary desire
there must be accountability
disparate and misinformed
fear will keep us all in place

so i go hunting for witches

to see you when i wake up
is a gift i didn't think could be real
to know that you feel the same as i do
is a three fold utopian dream

you do something to me that i can't explain
so would i be out of line if i said i miss you?

i see your picture
i smell your skin on the empty pillow next to mine
you have only been gone ten days
but already i'm wasting away

i know i'll see you again, whether far or soon
but i need you to know that i care and i miss you


it's a lonely feelin', wavin' you goodbye
i don't know what i'm leavin' until the moment is gone

checkin' in, never checkin' out
i get tired, kinda grumpy
but i'm never in doubt that you've got my back
when i see you again

sometimes it's like nothin' is going my way
even though i know i'm getting up on that stage
but now that i'm here, i got reason to believe
just the sight of you is getting the best out of me
just the sight of you is getting the best out of me

the airline lost my luggage, still got all this weight
and all the things i'm done with are showin' up again

breakin' in but i won't break down
i get tired, kinda grumpy
but i'm never in doubt that you've got my back
when i see you again

sometimes it's like nothin' is going my way
even though i know i'm gettin' up on that stage
but now that i'm here, i got reason to believe
just the sight of you is getting the best out of me
just the sight of you is getting the best out of me
just the sight of you is getting the best out of me

and i'll be damned if i ever forget
just how lucky i am to be
close to you when i need it the most
can you hold me if i wanna leave?

breakin' in but i won't break down
i get tired, kinda grumpy
but i'm never in doubt that you've got my back
when i see you again

sometimes it's like nothin' is going my way
even though i know i'm getting up on that stage
but now that i'm here, i got reason to believe

just the sight of you is getting the best out of me
just the sight of you is getting the best out of me
just the sight of you is getting the best out of me


to the edge, until we all get off
i will take you away with me
once and for all

time will see us realign
diamonds rain across the sky
shower me into the same realm

calculate, i'll embrace
hold on, come with me now
run away, outer space with me
once and for all

time will see us realign
diamonds rain across the sky
shower me into the same realm

get set
when the coffin shakes
and the needle breaks
come run away with me
come on, you'll see
once and for all

time will see us realign
diamonds rain across the sky
shower me into the same realm

time will lead us to the same realm
i will lead us to the same realm


all this time i'd never let you go
and now the same chains that i kept you in
they're holding down my soul
i set you up, i gave you life, i dragged you out the fire
and now you knocked me down, and you shut me out
and i can see it in your eyes
somehow you got it in your head
that you could make it on your own
you were sheltered, loved and fed
but you just couldn't leave it alone

leave it alone, leave it alone
leave it alone, leave it alone
leave it alone, leave it alone
leave it alone, leave it alone

well your heart was here
resting on my lap
and i'd do it all again
but i'm never coming back
well i know i'm lying
lying in the cold
yeah there's snow on the ground, and if i know myself
i'll be leaving down the road
i've been all around the world
but i got nowhere to go
i gave into this lonely life
and you can't change me now, so leave it alone

leave it alone, leave it alone
leave it alone, leave it alone
leave it alone, leave it alone
leave it alone, leave it alone

the ghosts are on the green
each and every night
oh, the distant light
that's the hardest part to take
that's the heart of all my pain
lying in the cold
oh, the distant light
in a hue we can't describe, still we know

could it all be over now
we've seen it all the while
there's no dimension to the clouds
the moon and world around
that's the heart of all my pain
'cause i don't want to go
oh, the distant light
in a hue we can t describe, still we know

and then, ooh baby, she's okay sugar

trying to push my face to the ground
where all they do is suck out my motherfucking brains
sugar 

the kombucha mushroom people
sitting around all day

in my desolate room
no lights

hello, it's me
i've thought about us for a long, long time
maybe i think too much but something's wrong
there's something here that doesn't last too long
maybe i shouldn't think of you as mine

seeing you
or seeing anything as much as i do you
i take for granted that you're always there
i take for granted that you just don't care
sometimes i can't help seeing all the way through

it's important to me
that you know you are free
'cause i never want to make you change for me

think of me
you know that i'd be with you if i could
i'll come around to see you once in a while
or if i ever need a reason to smile
and spend the night if you think i should

it's important to me

think of me, think of me, think of me
think of me, think of me, think of me
think of me, think of me, think of me

every day i recognise
what's deceased and what's alive
but don't repeat what i've just said
until gold has turned to lead
then all the tales will be told
whilst you and i are in the cold
but don't think this is the end
cos it's just begun my friend
when it's done
and all this is gone
just find a feeling, pass it on
for every tear cried in shame
there'll be someone else to blame
and every crime that i commit
there'll be a punishement to fit
but i'd accept what's coming round
if i could only lose this sound
that's been ringing in my ears
and tormenting me for years
when it's done
and all this is gone
just find a feeling pass it on


i went down to houston and i stopped in san antone
i passed up the station for the bus
i was trying to find me something
but i wasn't sure just what
man i ended up with pockets full of dust
so i went on to cleveland and i ended up insane
i bought a borrowed suit and learned to dance
and i was spending money like the way it likes to rain
man i ended up with pockets full of cane

oh my sweet carolina
what compels me to go
oh my sweet disposition
may you one day carry me home

i ain't never been to vegas but i gambled up my life
building newsprint boats i race to sewer mains
trying to find me something but i wasn't sure just what
funny how they say that some things never change

oh my sweet carolina
what compels me to go
oh my sweet disposition
may you one day carry me home


up here in the city it feels like things are closing in
the sunset's just my light bulb burning out
i miss kentucky and i miss my family
all the sweetest winds they blow across the south

oh my sweet carolina
what compels me to go
oh my sweet disposition
may you one day carry me home
may you one day carry me home

where's the love song to set us free?
too many people down
everything turning the wrong way 'round
and i don't know what love would be
but if we stop dreaming now
lord knows we'd never clear the clouds

and you've been so busy lately
that you haven't found the time
to open up your mind
and watch the world spinning
gently out of time

feel the sunshine on your face
it's in a computer now
gone to the future way out in space

and you've been so busy lately
that you haven't found the time
to open up your mind
and watch the world spinning
gently out of time


and you've been so busy lately
that you haven't found the time

tell me i'm not dreaming
but are we out of time?

we're out of time
out of time
out of time
out of time
out of time

i've been thinking 'bout what you have done to me
the damage is much deeper than you'll ever see
hit me like a hammer to my head
i wonder were you pushed or were you led?
chorus:
why did you do it? why did you do that thing to me?
why did you do it? why did you do that thing to me?
the only one who knows the truth
man it's him me and you
my friends they listen to the things i say
they listen and they hear more everyday
but i know they never understand it
because it was no accident you planned it
chorus:

 instrumental

chorus

voices in your body coming through on the radio
telegram force and ready

there's a fine line drawing my senses together
and i think it's about to break
if i listen close, i can hear them singers, ho, oh, oh

got ev'rything but you can just choose it
i won't just be a puppet on a string
don't go that way
i'll wait for you
i'm tired of all your friends
list'ning at your door
i want what's better for you
so long my friend and adversary
but i'll wait for you
get dressed, jump out of bed into a vest
are you o.k?
i've been all around this town
everybody's been singing the same song for ten years
i'll wait for you
will you wait for me too?
and they sacrifice their lives
and they lied about those odds
they'll say it a million times, and they'll say it again
so long my adversary and friend
don't go that way
i'll wait for you
i'm tired of all your friends
banging down your door
get up in the morning yelling 'no more'
so long my friend and adversary
but i'll wait for you


i'm on a train going nowhere
i ran away to make you care
this ain't my house, this ain't your home
not when i'm feeling this alone

so come on over.... yeah
i went to church and stopped believing
yeah so come on over yeah
well there's no god and i don't really care

let's run away, get out of here
i got no money and i don't care
this ain't my house, this ain't your home
not when i'm feeling this alone

so come on over.... yeah
i went to church and stopped believing
yeah so come on over yeah
well there's no god and i don't really care

so come on over.... yeah
i went to church and stopped believing
yeah so come on over yeah
well there's no god and i don't really care


almost every day
i see the same face
on broken picture tube
it fits the attitude
if you could see yourself
you put you on a shelf
your verbal masturbate
promise to nauseate
today i'll play the part of non parent
not make a hundred rules
for you to know about yourself
not lie and make you believe what's evil
is making love and making friends
and meeting god your own way, the right way

to see
to bleed
cannot be taught
in turn
you're making us
fucking hostile
we stand alone

the truth in right and wrong
the boundaries of the law
you seem to miss the point
arresting for a joint?
you seem to wonder why
hundreds of people die
you're writing tickets man
my mom got jumped they ran
now i'll play a public servant
to serve and protect
by the law and the state
i'd bust the punks
that rape steal and murder
and leave you be
if you crossed me, i'd shake your hand like a man
not a god



come meet your maker, boy
some things you can't enjoy
because of heaven hell
a fucking wives' tale
they put it in your head
then put you in your bed
he's watching say your prayers
cause god is everywhere
now i'll play a man learning priesthood
about to take the ultimate test in life
i question things because i am human
and call no one my father who's no closer that a stranger
i won't listen


fucking
fucking
fucking
fucking hostile


oh july is better off since april died
i can see september through the trees
and i can't lie, there's more to know than what's inside
maybe there's some reason in my memories
but all i know, it's easier to love you when i'm gone
but it's hard for me to leave
i don't know, this anger isn't helping anyone
and i don't know what i need

oh, st. marie, close my eyes before you leave
so i don't have to look at you in shame
oh, st. marie, take my hand and give me peace
'cause i don't think i'll ever be the same

here come the broken hearts, just as the music starts
one by one, they testify
i never did enough, i never cared enough
even though i stood, i always ran away
we all wonder why it's easier to blame the ones you love
'cause it's harder to believe that we fall sometimes
no matter how i try, i've given up
but now i have a chance to be

oh, st. marie, close my eyes before you leave
so i don't have to look at you in shame
oh, st. marie, take my hand and give me peace
'cause i don't think i'll ever be the same

sometimes the quiet ones are all i want to be
there's only so much left, the rest is up to me
you're all i'll ever want, i hope you feel it 'cause
as far as i'm concerned, you're exactly what i need

oh, st. marie, close my eyes before you leave
so i don't have to look at you in shame
oh, st. marie, take my hand and give me peace
'cause i don't think i'll ever be the same
'cause i don't think i'll ever be the same
'cause i don't think i'll ever be the same

the things my father said
would make me a better man
hard work and the love of friends
a woman that understands
i hope my father knows
the seeds we've sown, still grow
at night i go to sleep and
pray he is watching over me
somewhere there's a star
that's shining so bright
that i can see you smile
and all that i need is one last chance
just to hear you say goodbye
sometimes i remember when
you taught me to tie my shoes
one thing i will never forget
is the day that i lost you
i hope you always know
that car that we built
will always roll
somewhere there's a star
that's shining so bright
that i can see you smile
and all that i need is one last chance
just to hear you say goodbye
and if you have a dream
you better hang on for dear life
and when the cold wind blows
just let it pass you by
yeah, things my father said
yeah, yeah, yeah
somewhere there's a star
that's shining so bright
that i can see you smile
and all that i need is one last chance
just to hear you say
goodbye
goodbye
just to hear you say
goodbye
goodbye


come on over, come unglued
it's not easy to see all of you
help yourselves, help is on the way
well, there's nothing to lose, so now i have something to say
maybe we can all recognize a moment of silence
maybe we can finally agree on the same point of view
a long time ago we believed, and we were united
so the last thing on earth i am ready to do is say "goodbye"

a long time ago we discovered that nothing could stop us
this hasn't torn us apart, so nothing ever will
how can we know where we are if the sun is behind us?
but this moment will show us the rest of our lives
no one is going to save us this time
no one can know what we're feeling, so don't even try


nothing can save me now, it's what i believe
the slit in the sky when you left is all i see
nothing to sing about, i've bared all my leaves
no vision or dreams about you came true for me

cut through this razor wire
and dine on your heart, mine till the end

stuck with illusion now, i drown in your sea
i hope that you'll first save yourself and then come for me

cut through this razor wire
and dine on your heart, mine till the end
break through, clip the wires
and writhe in your heart, mine till the end

a way, a way out, a way
down deep into your veins
all the way, all the way
down deep in your heart
all the way, all the way

cut through this razor wire
mine till the end
break through, clip the wire
dine on your heart, mine till the end

out on the tar plains, the glides are moving
all looking for a new place to drive
you sit beside me, so newly charming
sweating dew drops glisten, freshing your side
the sun drips down bedding heavy behind
the front of your dress all shadowy lined
and the droning engine throbs in time
with your beating heart
way down the lane away, living for another day
the aphids swarm up in the drifting haze
swim seagull in the sky
towards that hollow western isle
my envied lady holds you fast in her gaze
the sun drips down bedding heavy behind
the front of your dress all shadowy lined
and the droning engine throbs in time
with your beating heart
the sun drips down bedding heavy behind
the front of your dress all shadowy lined
and the droning engine throbs in time
with your beating heart
sing blue silver
and watching lovers part, i feel you smiling
what glass splinters lie so deep in your mind
to tear out from your eyes
with a word to stiffen brooding lies
but i'll only watch you leave me further behind
the sun drips down bedding heavy behind
the front of your dress all shadowy lined
and the droning engine throbs in time
with your beating heart
the sun drips down bedding heavy behind
the front of your dress all shadowy lined
and the droning engine throbs in time
with your beating heart
sing blue silver

known as albert schweitzer
there's more to this kind of camouflage
more than just colour and shape
who s crawling now, in the tall grass near my tent?
listen


i thought love was only true in fairy tales
meant for someone else but not for me
love was out to get me
that's the way it seemed
disappointment haunted all my dreams

then i saw her face, now i'm a believer
not a trace of doubt in my mind
i'm in love, i'm a believer 
i couldn't leave her if i tried

i thought love was more or less a givin' thing
seems the more i gave the less i got
what's the use in tryin'?
all you get is pain
when i needed sunshine i got rain

then i saw her face, now i'm a believer
not a trace of doubt in my mind
i'm in love, i'm a believer
i couldn't leave her if i tried


love was out to get me
that's the way it seemed

i will shape myself into your pocket
invisible
do what you want
do what you want
i will shrink and i will disappear
i will slip into the groove
and cut me off
and cut me off

there's an empty space inside my heart
where the weeds take root
and now i'll set you free
i'll set you free
there's an empty space inside my heart
where the weeds take root
so now i'll set you free
i'll set you free

slowly we unfurl
as lotus flowers
cause all i want is the moon upon a stick
just to see what if
just to see what is
i can't kick your habit
just to feed your fast ballooning head
listen to your heart

we will shrink and we'll be quiet as mice
and while the cat is away
do what we want
do what we want

there's an empty space inside my heart
where the weeds take root
so now i set you free
i set you free

cause all i want is the moon upon a stick
just to see what if
just to see what is
bird that s flown into my room

slowly we unfurl
as lotus flowers
cause all i want is the moon upon a stick
i dance around a pit
the darkness is beneath
i can't kick your habit
just to feed your fast ballooning head
listen to your heart


i do not understand
what it is i've done wrong
full of holes, check for pulse
blink your eyes
one for yes, two for no

i have no idea what i am talking about
i'm trapped in this body and can't get out

you killed the sound, removed backbone
a pale imitation with the edges all
sawn off

i have no idea what you are talking about
your mouth moves only with someone's hand up your arse

has the light gone out for you?
because the light's gone out for me
it is the twenty first century
it is the twenty first century
it can follow you like a dog
it brought me to my knees
they got a skin and they put me in
they got a skin and they put me in
all the lines wrapped 'round my face
all the lines wrapped 'round my face
and for anyone else to see
and for anyone else to see
i'm a lie

i've seen it coming
they've seen it coming
they've seen it coming
they've seen it coming


starlit night
the moon is shining bright
you are the one that i need
up at your window
i see a shadow
silhouette of your grace
here's this flower
i picked for all the hours
that you've spent with me
the one i love
that i've been dreaming of
sailing across the sea

let my hands flow through your hair
moving closer, a kiss we'll share
passionate love to be all night long
we'll never break, as one too strong

nothing's more
than what our love is for
as i kiss your cheek
oh, so softly
hands flowing down my back
1,000 hours, i'll never leave
our romance
is a love trance
and now we'll never part
1,000 hours
of such a love shower
we'll never stop, once we start

let my hands flow through your hair
moving closer, a kiss we'll share
passionate love to be all night long
we'll never break, as one too strong

let my hands flow through your hair
moving closer, a kiss we'll share
passionate love to be all night long
we'll never break, as one too strong

ahhh...


staring out of my window watching the cars go rolling by
my friends are gone i've got nothing to do
so i sit here patiently watching the clock tick so slowly
gotta get away or my brains will explode

give me something to do to kill some time
take me to that place that i call home
take away the strains of being lonely
take me to the tracks at christie road

see the hills from afar standing on my beat up car
the sun went down and the night fills the sky
now i feel like me once again as the train comes rolling in
smoked my boredom gone, slapped my brains up so high

give me something to do to kill some time
take me to that place that i call home
take away the strains of being lonely
take me to the tracks at christie road


mother, stay out of my way of that place we go
we'll always seem to find our way to christie road
mother, stay out of my way of that place we go
we'll always seem to find our way to christie road

if there is one thing that i need
that makes me feel complete
so i go to christie road
it's home, it's home
it's home
it's home
it's home


i'm like a child looking off in the horizon
i'm like an ambulance that's turning on the sirens
oh i'm still alive
i'm like a soldier coming home for the first time
i dodged a bullet and i walked across a landmine
oh i'm still alive

am i bleeding? am i bleeding from the storm?
just shine a light into the wreckage
so far away, away

'cause i'm still breathing
'cause i'm still breathing on my own
my head's above the rain and roses
making my way away
'cause i'm still breathing
'cause i'm still breathing on my own
my head's above the rain and roses
making my way away
my way to you

i'm like a junkie tying off for the last time
i'm like a loser that's betting on his last dime
oh i'm still alive
i'm like a son that was raised without a father
i'm like a mother barely keeping it together
oh i'm still alive

am i bleeding? am i bleeding from the storm?
just shine a light into the wreckage
so far away, away

'cause i'm still breathing
'cause i'm still breathing on my own
my head's above the rain and roses
making my way away
'cause i'm still breathing
'cause i'm still breathing on my own
my head's above the rain and roses
making my way away, away...

as i walked out on the ledge
are you scared to death to live?
i've been running all my life
just to find a home that's for the restless
and the truth that's in the message
making my way away, away

'cause i'm still breathing
'cause i'm still breathing on my own
my head's above the rain and roses
making my way away
'cause i'm still breathing
'cause i'm still breathing on my own
my head's above the rain and roses
making my way away, away...
'cause i'm still breathing
'cause i'm still breathing on my own
my head's above the rain and roses
making my way away
my way to you


on the mountain where i was born
there are trees that would call my name
on the wind, they would bring a song
for every feral lead to claim
they said keep your eyes open
and we'll teach you to dream while you are awake
well, they haven't spoken
since their branches were broken for the fire that they told me to

feral roots calling me back home
feral roots are calling me back home

on the book where my page was torn
there are words that i don't understand
all my elders they tell me those ones
were not written by human hands
well, i just don't believe that's true
if the truth can be written, then the truth can be hid
those words are commanding you
though your body may grow old in your mind
you must remain a kid

feral roots are calling me back home
feral roots calling me back home
feral roots calling me back home
feral roots calling me back home


feral roots calling me back home
feral roots calling me back home
feral roots calling me back home
feral roots calling me back home


nothing here to see
just a kid like me
tryin' to cut some teeth
tryin' to figure it out

nothing better to do
when i'm stuck on you
i'm still, i'm here
tryin' to figure it out

getting hard to sleep
blood is in my dreams
love is killing me
tryin' to figure it out

nothing better to do
when i'm stuck on you
i'm still in here
tryin' to figure it out

i let it go
'cause i won't see you later
and we're not allowed to talk it out
i said i'd go
put myself on show
but i'm still tryin' to figure it out

but you didn't know i planned it out

and we're not allowed to figure it out, oh

well how's your view of things today?
got up young to fade away
the sinners sin but aren't aware
our fables take us everywhere
i can't keep up with you
i can't keep up
i can't compete with history
we'll film it live but dub our tale
the mystery must stay inside
look at our homes, look at our lives
in control of the morning
in control of the sea

you are creating all the bubbles at night
i'm chasing round trying to pop them all the time
we don't need to trust a single word they say
you are creating all the bubbles at play

there's a girl, there's a girl
there's a girl, there's a girl
and she's down by the river
in her own creepy world
there's a girl, there's a girl
and she's down by the river
it's time to consider
that baby is a sinner
she'll wash away your sins  wash away your sins 
she'll wash away your sins  wash away your sins 
she'll wash away your sins and go home

i only once upset my kin
accused him of a moral slip
he came back and claimed a change
i know his life's the same again
i can't ask him again
i should let it go

you are creating all the bubbles at night
i'm chasing round trying to pop them all the time
we don't need to trust a single word they say
you are creating all the bubbles at play
there's a girl, there's a girl
there's a girl, there's a girl
and she's down by the river
in her own creepy world
there's a girl, there's a girl
and she's down by the river
it's time to consider
that baby is a sinner
there's a girl, there's a girl
there's a girl, there's a girl
she'll wash away your sins
she's face down in the river


by, oh by, the way
of an explanation
cast adrift
off the shores of shotter's nation
i had a look in
cave my skull in like a brick
call now
what use am i to anyone?
i'm fucked, forlorn, frozen
beneath the summer
don't sing along
or you'll get what i got told

straight from the heart of my misery
so, comes a delivery
straight from the heart, to you

yeah you, now you, now you

oh what on earth
do you intend to do?
see if you can
tick the man, go round town
where all you skins, and mods
you get together
make pretend
it's 1969 forever
find a girl, have a drink
have a dance and play

the song that'll deliver me
straight from the harshness of misery
cos this song's a delivery
straight from my heart to you
yes here comes a delivery
straight from the heart of the misery
oh that song might deliver me
straight from the heart, to you
so here comes a delivery
straight from the heart of my misery
here comes a delivery
straight from the heart, to you


come and see me and maybe you'll die
but i can keep you in artwork, the fluid kind
that's enough for excitements today
prostrated faded, it's pay to play

come and see me, yeah, maybe you'll try
i've been holding these pyros til they could fly
open up and enlighten again
enjoy the skyline, it's an incremental end

"walk in on your own feet"
says the rover
"it's my way or they all leave"
says the rover
 ooooh, ooooh 
the rover

 a suffit, hell yeah, maybe it's time
you can't stick to the highways, it's suicide
i'm welling up with excitements again
the apex resolves, you need to tell your friends

"walk in on your own feet"
says the rover
"it's my way or they all leave"
says the rover
 ooooh, ooooh 
the rover
 ooooh, ooooh 
the rover

come and see me, yeah baby, let's cry
satin face in some worlds we d be too kind
nature s subjected to fires again
falling for my independence

"walk in on your own feet"
says the rover
you were high and on the wrong street
till the rover

said "hop in, all in"
 ooooh, ooooh 
the rover
"hop in, all in"
 ooooh, ooooh 
the rover
 ooooh, ooooh 
the rover
"all in, all in"
 ooooh, ooooh 
the rover
he barely has to seek repentants

now i rest my head from
such an endless dreary time
a time of hopes and happiness
that had you on my mind
those days are gone and now it seems
as if i'll get some rest
but now and then i'll see you again
and it puts my heart to the test
so, when are all my problems gonna end?
i'm understanding now that
we are only friends
to this day i'm asking why
i still think about you
as the days go on i wonder
will this ever end?
i find it hard to keep control
when you're with your boyfriend
i do not mind if all i am is
just a friend to you
all i want to know right now
is if you think about me too
so, when are all my problems gonna end?
i'm understanding now that
we are only friends
to this day i'm asking why
i still think about you...yeah
so, when are all my problems gonna end?
i'm understanding now that
we are only friends
to this day i'm asking why
i still think about you


dear mother, can you hear me whining?
it's been three whole weeks
since that i have left your home
this sudden fear has left me trembling
cause now it seems that i am out here on my own
and i'm feeling so alone

pay attention to the cracked streets
and the broken homes
some call it the slums, some call it nice
i want to take you through a wasteland
i like to call my home
welcome to paradise

a gunshot rings out at the station
another urchin snaps and left dead on his own
it makes me wonder why i'm still here
for some strange reason it's now
feeling like my home
and i'm never gonna go 

pay attention to the cracked streets
and the broken homes
some call it the slums, some call it nice
i want to take you through a wasteland
i like to call my home
welcome to paradise


dear mother, can you hear me laughing?

and the broken homes
some call it the slums, some call it nice

i sit alone in my bedroom
staring at the walls
i've been up all damn night long
my pulse is speeding
my love is yearning

i hold my breath and close my eyes and...
dream about her
cause she's 2000 light years away
she holds my malachite so tight so...
never let go
cause she's 2000 light years away
years away 

i sit outside and watch the sunrise
lookout as far as i can
i can't see her, but in the distance
i hear some laughter
we laugh together

cause she's 2000 light years away
she holds my malachite so tight so...
never let go

she holds my malachite so tight so...

cause she's 2000 light years away
years away 


she, she screams in silence
a sullen riot penetrating through her mind
waiting for a sign
to smash the silence with the brick of self control

are you locked up in a world that's been planned out for you?
are you feeling like a social tool without a use?
scream at me until my ears bleed
i'm taking heed just for you

she, she's figured out
all her doubts were someone else's point of view
waking up this time
to smash the silence with the brick of self control

are you locked up in a world that's been planned out for you?
are you feeling like a social tool without a use?
scream at me until my ears bleed
i'm taking heed just for you

pedro lives out of the wilshire hotel
he looks out a window without glass
the walls are made of cardboard, newspapers on his feet
his father beats him cause he's too tired to beg
he's got 9 brothers and sisters
they're brought up on their knees
it's hard to run when a coat hanger beats you on the thighs
pedro dreams of being older and killing the old man
but that's a slim chance he's going to the boulevard
he's going to end up, on the dirty boulevard
he's going out, to the dirty boulevard
he's going down, to the dirty boulevard
this room cost 2,000 dollars a month
you can believe it man it's true
somewhere a landlord's laughing till he wets his pants
no one here dreams of being a doctor or a lawyer or anything
they dream of dealing on the dirty boulevard
give me your hungry, your tired your poor i'll piss on 'em
that's what the statue of bigotry says
your poor huddled masses, let's club 'em to death
and get it over with and just dump 'em on the boulevard
get 'em out, on the dirty boulevard
going out, to the dirty boulevard
they're going down, on the dirty boulevard
going out
outside it's a bright night
there's an opera at lincoln center
movie stars arrive by limousine
the klieg lights shoot up over the skyline of manhattan
but the lights are out on the mean streets
a small kid stands by the lincoln tunnel
he's selling plastic roses for a buck
the traffic's backed up to 39th street
the tv whores are calling the cops out for a suck
and back at the wilshire, pedro sits there dreaming
he's found a book on magic in a garbage can
he looks at the pictures and stares at the cracked ceiling
"at the count of 3" he says, "i hope i can disappear"
and fly fly away, from this dirty boulevard
i want to fly, from dirty boulevard
i want to fly, from dirty boulevard
i want to fly fly fly fly, from dirty boulevard
i want to fly away
i want to fly
fly, fly away
i want to fly
fly fly away  fly a  
fly fly fly   way, ooohhh... 
fly fly away  i want to fly fly away 
fly away  i want to fly, wow woh, no, fly away 

my veins are blue and connected
and every single bone in my brain is electric
but i dig ditches like the best of 'em
yo trabajo duro
como en madera y yeso
como en madera y yeso
and even god herself has fewer plans than me
but she never helps me out with my scams for free, though
she grabs a stick and then she pokes it at me
when i say nothin', i say everything
yeah when i say nothin', i say everything
they threw me down in a lazaretto
born rotten, bored rotten
makin' models of people i used to know
out of coffee and cotton
and all my illegitimate kids have begotten
thrown down to the wolves, made feral for nuttin'
quarantined on the isle of man
and i'm tryin' to escape any way that i can, oh
any way that i can, oh
i have no time left
time is lost
no time at all, throw it in a garbage can
and i shake god's hand
i jump up and let her know when i can
this is how i'm gonna do it
 guitar solo 
they wanna blow down the prison
they're lightin' fires with the cash of the masses
and like the dough, i don't fall down
i'm so detroit i make it rise from the ashes


chip: 7a
davy: what number is this, chip?
other 3 monkees: 7 a 
davy: ok , know what i mean, like don t get excited man. it s cause i m short, i know

oh, i could hide 'neath the wings
of the bluebird as she sings
the six o'clock alarm would never ring
but it rings and i rise
wipe the sleep out of my eyes
my shavin' razor's cold and it stings.

cheer up, sleepy jean
oh, what can it mean
to a daydream believer
and a homecoming queen

you once thought of me
as a white knight on his steed
now you know how happy i can be
oh, and our good times starts and end
without dollar one to spend.
but how much, baby, do we really need
cheer up, sleepy jean
oh, what can it mean
to a daydream believer
and a homecoming queen
cheer up, sleepy jean
oh, what can it mean
to a daydream believer
and a homecoming queen

cheer up, sleepy jean
oh, what can it mean
to a daydream believer
and a homecoming queen




i am the son and the heir
of a shyness that is criminally vulgar
i am the son and heir of nothing in particular

you shut your mouth
how can you say i go about things the wrong way?
i am human and i need to be loved
just like everybody else does

i am the son and the heir
of a shyness that is criminally vulgar
i am the son and heir of nothing in particular

you shut your mouth
how can you say i go about things the wrong way?
i am human and i need to be loved
just like everybody else does

there's a club, if you'd like to go
you could meet somebody who really loves you
so you go and you stand on your own
and you leave on your own
and you go home and you cry and you want to die
when you say "it's gonna happen now"
when exactly do you mean?
see i've already waited too long
and all my hope is gone

you shut your mouth
how can you say i go about things the wrong way?
i am human and i need to be loved
just like everybody else does


shut the bedroom window in the morning
go to the shop, make plans to be leaving
in the morning
thought i was sleeping it was just a dream
an alley cat chewing on dead meat
in the morning

out of the dark and into the light
when the morning comes i will be alright

when i leave i try not to wake her
tea and a toast to yesterday's capers
in the morning
she wrote my name on the red telephone box
when i got there she'd already rubbed it off
in the morning

out of the dark and into the light
when the morning comes i will be alright

and all this time i've watched it change
but it's still the same

in the morning
in the morning
in the morning
in the morning


indigo puff
take me where the sun shines from my mind
load up the guns
and drive towards the place we left behind

you're the one, you're the one, you're the one
running through my brain
it's in my brain
you're the one, you're the one, you're the one
you're the one, you're the one, you're the one
in my heart, in my bones and in my soul
you're the one who keeps me on my own

take it in right
and breathe into your hungry appetite

time has come and time is gone
cities burn, we got youth to spend
and time to waste in love
to live again, my friend

cities burn, we don't give a damn
'cause we got all our friends right here
we got youth to spend

'cause time away from me

cities burn, we don't give a damn
'cause we got all our friends right here
we got youth to spend

time away from me is what i need

we left the cliff
wandered down the broadway to the elms
for another
a fight broke out
someone took objection to my face
with a bottle
i thought i was dreaming
but some girls are screaming
and my face is streaming
blood as well
soon as i had spoken
like some demon woken
now my nose is broken
what the hell?
take your fight outside
that's it for tonight
take your fight outside
 we don't want any trouble in here 
that's it for tonight
the guy was high
crazy kind of hatred in his eyes
taken over
the cops were called
someone put some water on my face
and i passed out
i thought i was dreaming
there were sirens screaming
and my friends were leaving me to die
but it wasn't heaven
just ward 27
and we'll do it all again tonight
take your fight outside
 we've got this thing under control 
that's it for tonight

i found a picture of you, oh
it hijacked my world that night
from a place in the past we've been cast out of, oh
now we re back in the fight

yes, we're back on the chain gang
whoa, back on the chain gang

a circumstance beyond our control, oh
the phone, the tv, and the news of the world
got in the house like a pigeon from hell, oh
sand in our eyes, descended like flies

yes, we're back on the chain gang
whoa, back on the chain gang

the powers that be
that force us to live like we do
bring me to my knees
when i see what they ve done to you
but i'll die as i stand here today
knowing that deep in my heart
they'll fall to ruin one day
for making us part

i found a picture of you, oh
they were the happiest days of my life
like a break in the battle was your part, oh
lonely heart, lonely hearts

yes, we're back on the chain gang

the reckoning, the sickening
packaging subversion, pseudo sacrosanct perversion
go drill your deserts, go dig your graves
then fill your mouth with all the money you will save
sinking in, getting smaller again
i'm done, it has begun, i'm not the only one

throw ourselves against the wall
but no one else can see
the preservation of the martyr in me

psychosocial, psychosocial, psychosocial
psychosocial, psychosocial, psychosocial

there are cracks in the road we laid
but where the temple fell, the secrets have gone mad
this is nothing new, but when we killed it all
the hate was all we had
who needs another mess? we could start over
just look me in the eyes and say i'm wrong
now there's only emptiness
venomous, insipid
i think we're done, i'm not the only one

and the rain will kill us all
throw ourselves against the wall
but no one else can see
the preservation of the martyr in me

psychosocial, psychosocial, psychosocial

black ocean, cold and dark
i am the hungry shark, fast and merciless
but the only girl that could talk to him just couldn't swim
tell me what's worse than this
and it echoes in the halls
they danced along the walls
the memories of your ghost
you are the one that i used to love
and i'm still in love, but i've never loved you the most

i've seen better days
so unafraid in my youth
i can't breathe, much less believe

you gave me everything you had
every little thing you had
a pure love unrehearsed
i've seen your best and worst
and at your worst, you're still the best
but at my best, i am the worst
it's a curse
your eyes are lined in pain
black tears don't hide in rain
and i tied you to the tracks
when i turned around, i heard the sound
i hit the ground, i know there's no turning back

i've seen better days
so unafraid in my youth
i can't breathe, much less believe the truth
better days, so unafraid in my youth
i can't breathe, much less believe the truth

black ocean, cold and dark
i am the hungry shark, fast and merciless
but the only girl that could talk to him, she couldn't swim
tell me what's worse than this
what's worse is all the coke
the ice, it numbs my throat if only for the night
my muscles will contract, your bones will crack
it's just a fact 'cause i am here to win this fight

i can't fucking breathe, much less believe the truth
i pick up a gun, aim for the sun, and shoot
better days, so unafraid in my youth
i can't breathe or believe the truth

your eyes are lined in pain
black tears don't hide in rain
and i tied you to the tracks
when i turned around, i heard that sound


say goodbye to oz and everything you own
california dreamin' is a pettibon
la's screaming you're my home
vanity is blasted but it's rarely fair
i could smell the prozac in your pretty hair
got a lot of friends, but is anyone there

i don't know but it's been said
your heart is stronger than your head
and this location is my home

stick n move you're living in a quick world
got a heavy laugh for such a tiny girl
born into it that's for sure

rivers get connected so much stronger than expected well
sick love comes to wash us away
prisons of perspective
how your vision gets corrected and
sick love is my modern cliche

people talk and tell you what you want to hear
do you really need another souvenir
superheroes tend to disappear
fame is just a trick you see an empty glass
leave you feeling thirsty and so very fast
chase your tail my baby it'll be your last

i don't know but it's been said
your heart is stronger than your head
and this location is my home

rivers get connected so much stronger than expected well
sick love comes to wash us away
prisons of perspective

openly defective is the lover you elected and
a portrait she was bound to portray


the bloody angle, the symmetry
your cheap adhesive isn't holding me
my mouth is a gun i can shoot, i can show you the truth
and i don t need a reason to lie to you
no pun intended, no punishment
if i offended you, you needed it
ideas are the bombs in your mind, a fissure in time
if you don t have a weapon, you can t have mine

i can bleed if i want to bleed
i can fail if i feel the need
this face is my last confession
this life it feels like a prison

oh, i m not afraid
i m giving into grievances again
you re looking at an absolute zero
i m not the devil, but i won t be your hero

the catatonic, the sacrilege
your primadonnas are a privilege
my god has a need to react, it s as simple as that
it s better just to settle than face the facts

i can bleed if i want to bleed
i can fail if i feel the need
this face is my last confession
this life it feels like a prison

oh, i m not afraid
i m giving into grievances again
you re looking at an absolute zero
i m not the devil, but i won t be your hero

one thing that i can t stand
is when the minutes fight the second hand
i ll waste a lifetime's worth just to cling to one more day

no fucking quarter, no premiums
the world is stuck in delirium
man is a four letter word, it s really absurd
the hate isn't fake it s just inferred

oh, i m not afraid
i m giving into grievances again
i m down to absolute zero
another zealot with the weight of the fucking world
oh, i m not afraid
and i will let you down as i hold you in
you re looking at an absolute zero
i m not the devil, but i won t be your hero

i could either burn
or cut off my pride and buy some time
a head full of lies is the weight, tied to my waist

the river of deceit pulls down, oh oh
the only direction we flow is down
down, oh down
down, oh down
down, oh down
down, oh down

my pain is self chosen

the river of deceit pulls down, yeah
the only direction we flow is down
down, oh down
down, oh down

things ain't been quite the same
i gotta get back to dallas
and tie up a few loose ends
i'm gonna work a week make a hundred dollars
aw and hit the road again
so i don't want you to think
that you're the first one
to leave me out here on my own
'cause this ain't gonna be the first time
this ol' cowboy spent the night alone
now honey i've been a fool but a bigger fool
i can't remember when i've been
just to open up my heart
and let you walk right in
but there's one thing in this life
that ain't hard for me to do
that's as soon as i kiss the lips of another woman
i'm gonna forget all about you
so i don't want you to think
that you're the first one
to leave me out here on my own
'cause this ain't gonna be the first time
this ol' cowboy spent the night alone
 instrumental 
but if you wrote all the woman's names down i know
and let me pick one out
i don't believe there'd be one in the whole bunch
aw i'd give a hoot about
so i don't want you to think
that you're the first one
to leave this ol' boy out here on his own
no it ain't gonna be the first time
this ol' cowboy spent the night alone
no it ain't gonna be the first time
this ol' cowboy spent the night alone

sister bluebird flying high above
shine your wings forward to the sun
hide the myst'ries of life on your way
though you've seen them, please don't say a word
what you don't know, i have never heard
starship trooper, go sailing on by
catch my soul, catch the very light
hide the moment from my eager eye
though you've seen there, please don't tell a soul
what you can't see, can't be very whole
speak to me of summer
long winters longer than time can remember
the setting up of other roads
to travel on in old accustomed ways
i still remember the talks by the water
the proud sons and daughter
that knew the knowledge of the land
spoke to me in sweet accustomed ways
mother life, hold firmly on to me
catch my knowledge higher than the day
lose as much as only you can show
though you've seen me, please don't say a word
what i don't know, i have never shared
ii. disillusion
loneliness is a power that we possess to give or take away forever
all i know can be shown by your acceptance of the facts there shown before you
take what i say in a different way and it's easy to say that this is all confusion
as i see a new day in me, i can also show it you and you may follow
speak to me of summer

too late
he knows you're all back to front
your bottom lip shaking
your happiness quakes as it's torn apart
sunday late
when you go and get your stuff
"what's yours is mine"
that unpractical line back to bite your arm

no, don't leave him anything
no letters on the side
you've gone over everything
screw ups and the whys
erase him, his memory
a tortured decline
was never your style

and it's wild dreams of the start
at the finish line
gum peeling apart
from each other's lives

too late
they all know you hate your jobs
your liminal friends with their plans to ascend
like some holy mob
get it straight
a lifeboat's for better hearts
prescription or not
there's some morals forgot white tattoo them on

no, don't read him anything
no poem, song or line
there's virtue in everything
but most in all that's quiet
an action is meddling
a dagger in time
better leave it to dry

and it's wild dreams of the start
at the finish line
gum peeling apart
from each other's lives
and it's wild dreams of the start
at the finish line
gum peeling apart
from each other's lives

wild dreams of the start
at the finish line
gum peeling apart
from each other's lives
wild dreams of the start
at the finish line
gum peeling apart

their faces twisted in shock
now the fools come gunning
to put our heads to the block
sick of the laughter, sick of the pain
sick of the feeling, this feeling of shame
sick of white folks privileged and vain
protesting a culture that isn't the same

in a world of minimal affection
can you give yourself in a word
to a girl with a washed out complexion
she's a mutual friend of ours
anyone, anyone, anyone, anyone, anyone?
is there anyone there?
you forget how to make a connection
when  you've wanted one for so long

moving on
when you don't have a lot in common
when the world
if you don t even know my name

what is life if not for affection?
felt invisible, took too hard
found an app, and drove to distraction
is if everyone went away
anyone, anyone, anyone, anyone, anyone?
is there anyone there?
fall back and into the quiet
where i've wanted you for so long

moving on
when you don't have a lot in common
when the world
if you don t even know my name
how am i supposed to hear you calling
if i can t hear a word you say?
how am i supposed to hear you calling
if i can t hear a word you say?

an old cowboy went ridin' out one dark and windy day
upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way
when all at once a mighty herd of red eyed steers he saw
a ploughin' through the ragged skies and up a cloudy draw
their brands were still on fire and their hooves were made of steel
their horns were black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel
a bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky
he saw the riders coming hard... and he heard their mournful cry
yippie i ay yippie i oh
ghost riders in
ghost riders in the sky
yippie i ay  yippie i ay  yippie i oh  yippie i oh 
ghost riders in the sky
their faces gaunt, their eyes were blurred, their shirts all soaked with sweat
they're ridin' hard to catch that herd but they 'ain't caught 'em yet
'cause they've got to ride forever in the range up in the sky
on horses snorting fire as they ride hard, hear them cry
yippie i ay yippie i oh
ghost riders in
ghost riders in the sky
ghost riders in the sky

come in with the sunrise, who knows where you go

your bad behavior has finally caught up to you

roots of evil growing into trees

bad little doggie
i'm through messin', time to learn your lesson

frankie was a good girl
everybody knows
paid one hundred dollars
for albert's new suite of clothes
he was her man but he done her wrong
albert said, "i'm leaving you
won't be gone for long
don't wait up for me
or worry about me when i'm gone"
he was her man but he done her wrong
frankie went down to the corner saloon
get a bucket of beer
said to the bartender
"has my lovin' man been here?"
he was her man but he done her wrong
"well, i ain't gonna tell you no stories
i ain't gonna tell you no lies
i saw albert an hour ago
with a gal named alice bly"
he was her man but he done her wrong
frankie went down to 12th street
lookin' up through the window high
she saw her albert there
lovein' up alice bly
he was her man but he done her wrong
frankie pulled out a pistol
pulled out a forty four
gun went off a rootie toot toot
and albert fell on the floor
he was her man but he done her wrong
frankie got down upon her knees
took albert into her lap
started to hug and kiss him
but there was no bringin' him back
he was her man but he done her wrong
"gimme a thousand policemen
throw me into a cell
i shot my albert dead
and now i'm goin' to hell
he was her man but he done me wrong"
judge said to the jury
"plain as a thing can be
a woman shot her lover down
murder in the second degree"
he was her man but he done her wrong
frankie went to the scaffold
calm as a girl could be
turned her eyes up towards the heavens
said, "nearer, my god, to thee"
he was her man but he done her wrong

crimson flames tied through my ears
rollin' high and mighty traps
pounced with fire on flaming roads
using ideas as my maps
"we'll meet on edges, soon," said i
proud 'neath heated brow
ah, but i was so much older then
i'm younger than that now
half wracked prejudice leaped forth
"rip down all hate," i screamed
lies that life is black and white
spoke from my skull. i dreamed
romantic facts of musketeers
foundationed deep, somehow
ah, but i was so much older then
i'm younger than that now
girls' faces formed the forward path
from phony jealousy
to memorizing politics
of ancient history
flung down by corpse evangelists
unthought of, though, somehow
ah, but i was so much older then
i'm younger than that now
a self ordained professor's tongue
too serious to fool
spouted out that liberty
is just equality in school
"equality," i spoke the word
as if a wedding vow
ah, but i was so much older then
i'm younger than that now
in a soldier's stance, i aimed my hand
at the mongrel dogs who teach
fearing not that i'd become my enemy
in the instant that i preach
my pathway led by confusion boats
mutiny from stern to bow
ah, but i was so much older then
i'm younger than that now
yes, my guard stood hard when abstract threats
too noble to neglect
deceived me into thinking
i had something to protect
good and bad, i define these terms
quite clear, no doubt, somehow
ah, but i was so much older then
i'm younger than that now

well, i see you got your brand new leopard skin pill box hat
yes, i see you got your brand new leopard skin pill box hat
well, you must tell me, baby
how your head feels under somethin' like that
under your brand new leopard skin pill box hat
well, you look so pretty in it
honey, can i jump on it sometime?
yes, i just wanna see
if it's really that expensive kind
you know it balances on your head
just like a mattress balances
on a bottle of wine
your brand new leopard skin pill box hat
well, if you wanna see the sun rise
honey, i know where
we'll go out and see it sometime
we'll both just sit there and stare
me with my belt
wrapped around my head
and you just sittin' there
in your brand new leopard skin pill box hat
well, i asked the doctor if i could see you
it's bad for your health, he said
yes, i disobeyed his orders
i came to see you
but i found him there instead
you know, i don't mind him cheatin' on me
but i sure wish he'd take that off his head
your brand new leopard skin pill box hat
well, i see you got a new boyfriend
you know, i never seen him before
well, i saw him
makin' love to you
you forgot to close the garage door
you might think he loves you for your money
but i know what he really loves you for
it's your brand new leopard skin pill box hat

you must leave now take what you need
you think will last
but whatever you wish to keep you better grab it fast
yonder stands your orphan with his gun
crying like a fire in the sun

well, i heard there was a secret chord
that david played and it pleased the lord
but you don't really care for music, do you?
well it goes like this: the fourth, the fifth
the minor fall and the major lift
the baffled king composing hallelujah

hallelujah
hallelujah
hallelujah
hallelujah

your faith was strong but you needed proof
you saw her bathing on the roof
her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you
she tied you to her kitchen chair
she broke your throne and she cut your hair
and from your lips she drew the hallelujah

hallelujah
hallelujah
hallelujah
hallelujah

baby, i've been here before
i've seen this room and i've walked this floor  you know 
i used to live alone before i knew you
and i've seen your flag on the marble arch
and love is not a victory march
it's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah

hallelujah
hallelujah
hallelujah
hallelujah

there was a time when you let me know
what's really going on below
but now you never show that to me, do you?
but remember when i moved in you
and the holy dove was moving too
and every breath we drew was hallelujah

hallelujah
hallelujah
hallelujah
hallelujah

maybe there's a god above
but all i've ever learned from love
was how to shoot somebody who outdrew you
and it's not a cry that you hear at night
it's not somebody who's seen the light
it's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah

hallelujah
hallelujah
hallelujah
hallelujah
hallelujah
hallelujah
hallelujah
hallelujah
hallelujah
hallelujah
hallelujah
hallelujah
hallelujah


summer time and the wind is blowing outside
in lower chelsea and i don't know
what i'm doing in this city
the sun is always in my eyes
it crashes through the windows
and i'm sleeping on the couch
when i came to visit you
that's when i knew i could never have you
i knew that before you did
still i'm the one who's stupid

and there's this burning
like there's always been
i never been so alone
and i've never been so alive

visions of you on a motorcycle drive by
the cigarette ash flies in your eyes
and you don't mind, you smile
and say the world doesn't fit with you
i don't believe you, you're so serene
careening through the universe
your axis on a tilt, you're guiltless and free
i hope you take a piece of me with you
and there's things i'd like to do
that you don't believe in
i would like to build something
but you never see it happen

and there's this burning
like there's always been
i never been so alone
and i've never been so alive


and there's this burning
there is this burning

where's the soul i want to know
new york city is evil
the surface is everything but i could never do that
someone would see through that
and this is our last time
we'll be friends again
i'll get over you, you'll wonder who i am

and there's this burning
like there's always been
i never been so alone
and i've never been so alive

i go home to the coast
it starts to rain i paddle out on the water
alone
taste the salt and taste the pain
i'm not thinking of you again
summer dies and swells rise
the sun goes down in my eyes
see this rolling wave
darkly coming to take me home

and i've never been so alone
and i've never been so alive


squinting from blinding rays of the sun, deep in the heart of july
there to perform for children of corn, whose crops stood well twelve foot high
three knaves remained to the end of the day, we refused their vile entreats
standing our ground, we played for the ears between the harvester's teeth

great plains, hardcore scenes
may not be the biggest but, lord, they're mean
and though my mind has been shot to hell
the details of that night i remember well

gravel and locust, they swore to rope us
we did our best to steer straight
trailer and hitch, straight into the ditch
praying to jesus and the holy saints
despite the violence, sometimes i look back
a nostalgia begins to take hold
wisdom of sorts is found in due course
in the rows of silver and gold

great plains, hardcore scenes
may not be the biggest but, lord, they're mean
and though my mind has been shot to hell
the details of that night i remember well
gimme the keys, they can keep the guarantee
gimme the keys, and get the hell out of dodge
hey man, we don't got your, we don't got your sm 57
look dude, why don't you try some old fashioned pma
through bloody butchers, we ran for hours
then hours grew into years
stalked by the fury of john brown's eyes
and still the storm hasn't cleared
despite the mileage, sometimes i look back
a nostalgia begins to take hold
wisdom of sorts is found, of course, in rows of silver and gold

great plains, hardcore scenes
may not be the biggest but, lord, they're mean
and though my mind has been shot to hell
the details of that night i remember well
gimme the keys, they can keep the guarantee
gimme the keys, and get the hell out of dodge


nooooo, no, no, noooo
nobody feels any pain
tonight as i stand inside the rain
everybody knows
that baby's got new clothes
but lately i've seen her ribbons and her bows
have fallen from her curls

as she takes just like a woman, yeah
and she makes love just like a woman, oh
and she aches just like a woman
but she breaks just like a little girl

queen mary, she's my friend
yes i believe i'll go see her again
nobody has to guess
baby can't be blessed
till she finally sees that
she's like all the rest
with her fog, her amphetamines and her pearls

as she takes just like a woman
yeah she does
and she makes love just like a woman
and she aches just like a woman
but she breaks just like a little girl

well it was raining from the first
and i was dying there of thirst
so i came in here
and your long time curse hurts
but what's worse
is are this pain here
i can't stay here
baby
ain't it clear that
i just can't fit
i believe it's time for us to quit
when we meet again
introduced as friends
please don't you let on
that you knew me when
i was hungry and
it was your world

oh, you fake just like a woman
yes you do
and you make love just like a woman
and then you ache just like a woman
but you break just like a little girl
but you break just like a little girl

william zanzinger killed poor hattie carroll
with a cane that he twirled around his diamond ring finger
at a baltimore hotel society gath'rin'
and the cops were called in and his weapon took from him
as they rode him in custody down to the station
and booked william zanzinger for first degree murder
but you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears
take the rag away from your face
now ain't the time for your tears
william zanzinger, who at twenty four years
owns a tobacco farm of six hundred acres
with rich wealthy parents who provide and protect him
and high office relations in the politics of maryland
reacted to his deed with a shrug of his shoulders
and swear words and sneering, and his tongue it was snarling
in a matter of minutes on bail was out walking
but you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears
take the rag away from your face
now ain't the time for your tears
hattie carroll was a maid of the kitchen
she was fifty one years old and gave birth to ten children
who carried the dishes and took out the garbage
and never sat once at the head of the table
and didn't even talk to the people at the table
who just cleaned up all the food from the table
and emptied the ashtrays on a whole other level
got killed by a blow, lay slain by a cane
that sailed through the air and came down through the room
doomed and determined to destroy all the gentle
and she never done nothing to william zanzinger
but you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears
take the rag away from your face
now ain't the time for your tears
in the courtroom of honor, the judge pounded his gavel
to show that all's equal and that the courts are on the level
and that the strings in the books ain't pulled and persuaded
and that even the nobles get properly handled
once that the cops have chased after and caught 'em
and that the ladder of law has no top and no bottom
stared at the person who killed for no reason
who just happened to be feelin' that way without warnin'
and he spoke through his cloak, most deep and distinguished
and handed out strongly, for penalty and repentance
william zanzinger with a six month sentence
oh, but you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears
bury the rag deep in your face
for now's the time for your tears

close your eyes, close the door
you don't have to worry anymore
i'll be your little baby tonight
shut the light, shut the shade
you don't have to be afraid
i'll be your baby tonight
well the mockingbird's gonna sail away
you won't regret it
the big fine moons gonna shine like a spoon
you won't regret, you won't forget
to get your shoes off
do not fear
bring that bottle over here
i'll be your baby tonight
well the mockingbird's gonna sail away
you won't regret it
the big fine moons gonna shine like a spoon
you won't regret, you won't forget
to get your shoes off
do not fear
bring that bottle over here
i'll be your baby tonight
i'll be your baby tonight

there was a wicked messenger
from eli he did come
with a mind that multiplied
the smallest matter
when asked who had sent for him
he answered with his thumb
for his tongue it could not speak, but only flatter
he stayed behind the assembly hall
it was there he made his bed
and oftentimes he could be seen returning
until one day he just appeared
with a note in his hand that read
"the soles of my feet, i swear they're burning."
oh, the leaves began to fallin'
and the seas began to part
and the people that confronted him were many
and he was told but these few words
which opened up his heart
"if you cannot bring good news, then don't bring any."

i sold my soul for the second time
'cause the man don't pay me
i begged my landlord for some more time
he said: "son, the bills are waiting"
my best friend called me the other night
he said: "man, are you crazy?"
my girlfriend told me to get a life
she said: "boy, you're lazy"

but i don't mind
as long as there's a bed beneath the stars that shine
i'll be fine
if you give me a minute
a man's got a limit
i can't get a life if my heart's not in it


but i don't mind
as long as there's a bed beneath the stars that shine
i'll be fine
if you give me a minute
a man's got a limit
i can't get a life if my heart's not in it

i lost my faith in the summer time
'cause it don't stop raining
the sky all day is as black as night
but i'm not complaining
i begged my doctor for one more line
he said: "son, words fail me"
it ain't no place to be killing time
i guess i'm just lazy

but i don't mind
as long as there's a bed beneath the stars that shine
i'll be fine

a man's got a limit
i can't get a life if my heart's not in it


hold on tight, you've got a way to go

and it makes you feel better than the other girls

and you pray they're just boys, they're not villains
one's got religious tattoos, he'll be forgiven

let go, there is nothing more to hide
seeing life through closed eyes
it's just a young understanding
you know, that time is on your side
seeing life through closed eyes
it's just a young understanding

cruising round in a friend's new car
you've always know they won't get you far
found yourself on a downward slope
it's ok, cause it makes you feel better than the other girls

and you pray they're just boys, they're not villains
one's got religious tattoos, he'll be forgiven

let go, there is nothing more to hide
seeing life through closed eyes
it's just a young understanding
you know, that time is on your side
seeing life through closed eyes
it's just a young understanding

torn apart, can't you see?
they left their hearts in the 70's
reach for a sign, reach for an understanding
reach for a sign, reach for an understanding
reach for a sign, reach for an understanding
reach for a sign, reach for an understanding

let go, there is nothing more to hide
seeing life through closed eyes

oh, what a skill to have, oh, what a skill
to have so many skills that make her distinctive
but they're not mine to have, no, they're not mine

and this is my head and this is my spout
but they work together; they can't figure anything out

so with the angst of a teenage band
here's another song about a gender i'll never understand
here's another song about a gender i'll never understand...

 ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

don't think i've ever seen your kind of pretty
wandering around this midnight mad house city
you got a look that says you've got it all together
so if you don't mind, i'd like to know you better

take me the long way around your town
were you the queen with the silver crown?
i want the secrets you keep, the shine underneath
of the diamond i think i just found
take me the long way around

i'd love to see just where your daddy met your momma
your hand me down '99 impala
show me the field you danced in clover
the harvest in october
when the leaves fall from the sky just like a sunday drive

take me the long way around your town
were you the queen with the silver crown?
i want the secrets you keep, the shine underneath
of the diamond i think i just found
take me the long way around

didn't think tonight when i walked in
i'd be falling for somewhere i've never been

take me the long way around your town
were you the queen with the silver crown?
i want your red blushing stories
your faults and your glories
that made you who you are right now
take me the long way around

well, now then, mardy bum
i've seen your frown and it's like looking down
the barrel of a gun, and it goes off
and out come all these words
oh, there's a very pleasant side to you
a side i much prefer

it's one that laughs and jokes around
remember cuddles in the kitchen, yeah
to get things off the ground
and it was; up, up, and away
ah, but it's right hard to remember that
on a day like today
when you're all argumentative
and you've got the face on

well, now then mardy bum
oh, i'm in trouble again, aren't i?
i thought as much
'cause you turned over there
pulling that silent disappointment face
the one that i can't bear

well, can't we just laugh and joke around?
remember cuddles in the kitchen, yeah
to get things off the ground
and it was; up, up, and away
ah, but it's right hard to remember that
on a day like today
when you're all argumentative
and you've got the face on

and yeah, i'm sorry i was late
but i missed the train
and then the traffic was a state
and i can't be asked to carry on in this debate
that reoccurs, oh, when you say i don't care
but, of course i do, yeah, i clearly do


so laugh and joke around
remember cuddles in the kitchen, yeah
to get things off the ground
and it was; up, up, and away
oh, but it's right hard to remember that
on a day like today
when you're all argumentative
and you've got the face on

so i said, i said, "what's your name
and where d'you wanna go from here?"
she gimme a little grin
and it went from ear to ear
she said, "this feels right
everything tonight"
forget the breath of the rest of the room
they'll flog themselves to death
and we'll be under the moon

i don't have to go
i could always stay
in this embrace forever
or at least one more day
one more day
so i said, i said, "where do you belong?"
i saw that little twinkle in her eye
she pulled me up and said "dance to this song"
i said, "now, this feels right
everything tonight
forget the eyes of the monsters green
a collection of critters cutting a desperate scene."

i don't have to go
i could always stay
in this embrace forever
we're not listening anyway
i don't have to go
i could always stay
in this embrace forever
or at least one more day
one more day
one more day
and i
i don't have to go
i could always stay
in this embrace forever
we're not listening anyway
i don't have to go
i could always stay
in this embrace forever
or at least one more day
one more day


did you get that house, the one with the swimming pool?
the one you never shut up about
i heard you got that job, and the extra pay works well for you
are you getting high and not coming down?

i need  to decipher the differences between
what i'll always want and what i'll never need

i don't need your
i don't need your swinging moods
your twenty first century blues
i want hugs not your scissor kicks
i don't need your
your broken plans or your panda eyes
your help to improve my social life
if my head's in the clouds, in the clouds i'll live
in the clouds i'll live

they say you've found some one with style to match their charm and wit
but are you having sex in the morning sun?
and is your head screwed tight or has success began to loosen it?
is the tip of the iceberg that much fun?

oh, help me decipher the differences between
what i'll always want and what i'll never need

i don't need your
i don't need your swinging moods
your twenty first century blues
i want hugs not your scissor kicks
i don't need your
your broken plans or your panda eyes
your help to improve my social life
if my head's in the clouds, in the clouds i'll live
if my head's in the clouds, then in the clouds i'll live

and i don't need your swinging moods
your twenty first century blues
and if nothing comes. then nothing has to leave
if my head's in the clouds, in the clouds i wanna be
i don't need your love
if my head's in the clouds, then in the clouds i'll live

 verse 1 
she's got stickers on her locker
and the boy's number's there in magic marker
i'm hungry and the hunger will linger
i eat sixteen saltine crackers then i lick my fingers
well every morning i deliver the news
black hat, white shoes and i'm red all over
she's got a pink mailbox, that she puts up front
garbage in garbage out, she's gettin' what she wants
who's jealous, who's jealous, who's jealous, who's jealous of who?
if i get busy then i couldn't care less what you do
but when i'm by myself i think of nothin' else
than if a boy just might be gettin' through and touchin' you
spike heels make a hole in a lifeboat
driftin' away when i m talkin' and laughin' as we float
i hear her whistle, that's how i know she's home
lipstick, eyelash, broke mirror, broken home
force fed, forced meds 'til i drop dead
you can t defeat her, when you meet her you ll get what i said
but lord knows there's a method to her madness
but the lord's joke is a boat in a sea of sadness
she doesn't know but when she's gone i sit and drink her perfume
i'm sure she's drinkin' too, but why, where, and what for, and whom?
and i'm solo rowin', i'm one side of the boat
lookin' out, throwin' up, a lifesaver down my throat
who's jealous, who's jealous, who's jealous, who's jealous of who?
who's jealous, who's jealous, who's jealous, who's jealous of who?
who's jealous, who's jealous, who's jealous, who's jealous of who?

"c'mon honey, let's go make some noise."

when we weren't so fractured and dazed
in a world
where we try to hurt each other
i know you feel bad
for what you did and how you recovered
im a blessed man
just to have touched your face
but then again
who are you to make me replace that

now maybe i didn't mean to treat you bad
but i did it anyway
and then maybe some would say your life was sad
but you lived it anyway
and so maybe your friends they stand around they watch you crumble
as you fall down to the ground
and then somedayyour friends they stand beside as you were flyin'
oh, you were flyin' oh so high
but then someday people look at you
for what they call their own
they watch you suffer
yeah they hear you calling home
and then someday we can take our time
to brush the leaves aside so you can reach us
hey but you left me far behind

some would say you're left with what you had
but you couldn't share the pain, no, no, no
couldn't share the pain, they watch you suffer
now maybe i could have made my own mistakes
but i lived with what i've known
and then maybe we might share in something great
won't you look at where we've grown
won't you look at where we've gone
and then someday comes, tomorrow holds
a sense of what i feel for you in my mind
as you trip the final line
and that cold day when you lost control
shame you left my life so soon
you should have told me, hey
hey but you left me far behind

i hear the drums echoing tonight
but she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
she's coming in, 12:30 flight
the moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation
i stopped an old man along the way
hoping to find some old forgotten words or ancient melodies
he turned to me as if to say
"hurry boy, it's waiting there for you"

it's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
there's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
i bless the rains down in africa
gonna take some time to do the things we never had

the wild dogs cry out in the night
as they grow restless longing for some solitary company
i know that i must do what's right
as sure as kilimanjaro rises like olympus above the serengeti
i seek to cure what's deep inside
frightened of this thing that i've become

it's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
there's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
i bless the rains down in africa
gonna take some time to do the things we never had

hurry boy, she's waiting there for you

it's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you

strangers waiting
up and down the boulevard
their shadows searching in the night
streetlights, people
living just to find emotion
hiding somewhere in the night

working hard to get my fill
everybody wants a thrill
payin' anything to roll the dice
just one more time

some will win, some will lose
some were born to sing the blues
oh, the movie never ends
it goes on and on and on and on

streetlights, people
ohohohhhhhhhhhh


nothing so loud
as hearing when we lie
truth is not kind
and you've said neither am i
and the air outside so soft is saying everything
everything

all i want is to feel this way
to be this close, to feel the same
all i want is to feel this way
the evening speaks, i feel it say

nothing's so cold
as closing the heart when all we need
is to free the soul
but we wouldn't be that brave i know
and the air outside so soft, confessing everything
everything

all i want is to feel this way
to be this close, to feel the same
all i want is to feel this way
the evening speaks, i feel it say

and it won't matter now
whatever happens will be
though the air speaks of all we'll never be
it won't trouble me

all i want is to feel this way
to be this close, to feel the same
all i want is to feel this way
the evening speaks, i feel it say
all i want is to feel this way  and it feels so close 
to be this close, to feel the same  let it take me in 
all i want is to feel this way  let it hold me so 
the evening speaks, i feel it say  i can feel it say 


i only lie when i love you
i only crawl when i hit the ground
you only cry when i love you
i only lie when i make a sound

go ahead, muck about
i got my conscience twisted
pull your hair, make me shout
it's just that you insisted i was good for nothing
like you were onto something

i only lie when i love you
i only crawl when i hit the ground
you only cry when i love you
i only lie when i make a sound
i only lie when i
i only lie when i
i only lie when i
i only lie when i
i only lie when i love you
i only crawl when i hit the ground
you only cry when i love you
i only lie when i make a sound

go ahead, pull the plug
broken finger, sticky trigger
now i can't get it off my chest
and now i'm wishing you were someone else
you know i'm up to something
diagnosed, no disease
got a suspicion but you just can't find it up your sleeve
and now i beg the truth be told from someone else
all of that fuss for nothing

i only lie when i love you
i only crawl when i hit the ground
you only cry when i love you
i only lie when i make a sound
i only lie when i
i only lie when i
i only lie when i
i only lie when i
i only lie when i love you
i only crawl when i hit the ground
you only cry when i love you
i only lie when i make a sound


i was a liar
i'll never be holy in your eyes
but you'll never be either
'cause i know that underneath your smile
hides the nights that you regret and the days you can't forget
'cause you know me
and we'll never be holy

i've been keeping to myself
and looking back over my shoulder
trying to live my life just like somebody else
and forget all the empty words i told ya

i'm a mess, these demons follow me home
it's easy to bury the guilt on my own
now my fears will finally swallow me whole
'cause i wasn't honest
and i never wanted to admit that

i was a liar
i'll never be holy in your eyes
but you'll never be either
'cause i know that underneath your smile
hides the nights that you regret and the days you can't forget
'cause you know me
and we'll never be holy

it's a sickness i can't seem to shake
'til i wake up alone and ashamed
or a tie that i'm too scared to break
in case i'm drunk and i need you again
i was never the one
i was always just easy
you would lend me enough to follow through
maybe when you're alone
and you look in the mirror
well, you can feel as low as i do

just a mess, these demons follow you home
it's easy to bury the guilt on your own
now your fears will finally swallow you whole
but i wasn't honest
and you never wanted to admit that

i was a liar
i'll never be holy in your eyes
but you'll never be either
'cause i know that underneath your smile
hides the nights that you regret and the days you can't forget
'cause you know me
and we'll never be holy
and we'll never be holy  holy in your eyes 
no, we'll never be holy  holy in your eyes 
'cause the nights that you regret and the days you can't forget
leave you lonely
and we'll never be holy

i'll always be a mess if i keep living this way
despite all my flaws, i still hope you're okay
i don't know if i can honestly say
that it's getting better
but at least together
we were holy


i buried my heart in a hole in the ground
with the lights and the roses and the cowards downtown
they threw me a party, there was no one around
they tried to call my girl but she could not be found

i buried my guilt in a pit in the sand
with the rust and the vultures and the trash downtown
so don't step to me, kid, you'll never be found
cause while you were sleeping, i took over your town

when i see a man, i see a lion
when i see a man, i see a liar
you're the apple of my eye, of my eye, of my eye
you're the apple of my eye, of my eye, i want ya

i fell for a girl with a port wine stain
i knew her initials but never her name
i tried and i tried and i was never the same
so no longer felt love and i'm forever changed

when i see a man, i see a lion
when i see a man, i see a liar
you're the apple of my eye, of my eye, of my eye
you're the apple of my eye, of my eye, i want ya
give up my money, give up my name, take it away
i'll give it away, i'll give it away, i'll give it
when i see a man, i see a lion
when i see a man, i see a liar


when i see a man, i see a lion
when i see a man, i see a liar
you're the apple of my eye, of my eye, of my eye
you're the apple of my eye, of my eye, i want ya
give up my money, give up my name, take it away
i'll give it away, i'll give it away, i'll give it
i m a sycophantic animal, i m a sycophantic fool, i m a sycophantic fool, i know
break up the chain, i'll break up the chain, i'll break it
give it away, i'll give it away, i'll give it
when i see a man, i see a lion
when i see a man, i see a liar
you're the apple of my eye, of my eye, of my eye
you're the apple of my eye, of my eye, i want ya
give up my money, give up my name, take it away
i'll give it away, i'll give it away, i'll give it
see you again, i'll see you again, i'll see ya
give it away, i'll give it away, i'll give it
when i feel low, when i feel low, i feel it
when i see a man, i see a lion
when i see a man, i see a liar
you're the apple of my eye, of my eye, of my eye
you're the apple of my eye, of my eye, i want ya


hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo

i ain't happy, i'm feeling glad
i got sunshine in a bag
i'm useless, but not for long
the future is coming on
i ain't happy, i'm feeling glad
i got sunshine in a bag
i'm useless, but not for long
the future is coming on
it's coming on, it's coming on
it's coming on, it's coming on

finally, someone let me out of my cage
now, time for me is nothing, 'cause i'm countin' no age
nah, i couldn't be there, now you shouldn't be scared
i'm good at repairs, and i'm under each snare
intangible, bet you didn't think, so i command you to
panoramic view, look, i'll make it all manageable
pick and choose, sit and lose, all you different crews
chicks and dudes, who you think is really kickin' tunes?
picture you getting down in a picture tube
like you lit the fuse, you think it's fictional?
mystical? maybe, spiritual hero
who appears in you to clear your view when you're too crazy?
lifeless to those, the definition for what life is
priceless to you, because i put you on the hype shit
you like it? gun smokin', righteous with one toke
get psychic among those, possess you with one go

i ain't happy, i'm feeling glad
i got sunshine in a bag
i'm useless, but not for long
the future is coming on
i ain't happy, i'm feeling glad
i got sunshine in a bag
i'm useless, but not for long
the future is coming on  that's right 
it's coming on, it's coming on
it's coming on, it's coming on

the essence, the basics, without it, you make it
allow me to make this childlike in nature
rhythm, you have it or you don't, that's a fallacy
i'm in them, every sproutin' tree, every child of peace
every cloud and sea, you see with your eyes
i see destruction and demise, corruption in disguise  that's right 
from this fuckin' enterprise, now i'm sucked into your lies
through russel, not his muscles
but percussion he provides for me as a guide, y'all can see me now
'cause you don't see with your eye, you perceive with your mind
that's the inner  fuck 'em  so i'ma stick around with russ and be a mentor
bust a few rhymes so motherfuckers remember
where the thought is, i brought all this
so you can survive when law is lawless  right here 
feelings, sensations that you thought was dead
no squealing and remember that it's all in your head

i ain't happy, i'm feeling glad
i got sunshine in a bag
i'm useless, but not for long
the future is coming on
i ain't happy, i'm feeling glad
i got sunshine in a bag
i'm useless, but not for long
my future is coming on
it's coming on, it's coming on
it's coming on, it's coming on

my future is coming on
it's coming on, it's coming on
it's coming on, it's coming on
my future
is coming on
it's coming on, it's coming on
it's coming on, it's coming on
it's coming on
my future is coming on
it's coming on, it's coming on
my future
it's coming on, it's coming on
it's coming on
my future
it's coming on, it's coming on
my future


i saw it coming
like the shadow on the wall
you started running
then everything turned cold
how did i become a lookalike
of someone you used to love?
someone you used to love

so dark
how did something so sweet tear us apart?
oh, on a sinking ship with a heavy heart
ooohhh
how did we get so dark?

nobody warned you
the tables would turn
and i could have told you
everything you've learnt
would burn to dust
now there's no one you can trust
just someone you used to love
someone you used to love

so dark
how did something so sweet tear us apart?
oh, on a sinking ship with a heavy heart
ooohhh
how did we get so dark?

how'd we get so dark?
how'd we get so dark?
how'd we get so dark?

how'd we get so dark?
how'd we get so dark?
how'd we get so dark?
how'd we get so dark?


standing in a crowded room, and i can't see your face
put your arms around me, tell me everything's ok
in my mind, i'm running round a cold and empty space
just put your arms around me, tell me everything's ok

how can it be permissible?

that kind of love is mythical
she's anything but typical
she's a craze you'd endorse, she's a powerful force
you're obliged to conform when there's no other cause
she used to look good to me, but now i find her
simply irresistible
simply irresistible
her loving is so powerful, huh 
it's simply unavoidable
the trend is irreversible

short cut to a quick buck is working all the time
renting out your mind
and saving every dime
because when ten of those combine
they cross a sacred line
and go from pocket change
to a gold mine
she said she'd be down to hangout
with her parents out of town she was hoping i'm around
for a party at her vacant place
i said i'd come; showed up and felt out of place
so i headed home
that's when she text my phone and ask me where
i was and when i said i was gone
she broke my spine
and in that pain
i realized that every dime i'd ever saved wasn't worth anything
what's the drive in being alive when you don't know who you are?
what's the fun in getting drunk if you can t take it too far
yeah my friends are saying i ve been wasting all my weekends contemplating
if it's me or the booze that really gets wasted
i don t even taste it
when i m throwing back shots as if its a race then
quickly chase them
without a mouth i'm so down
my hometown only makes me feel alone
but just when i
hometown girls are my greatest fear
so in a couple days i'll be off to college for another year
thinkin'
i'm gettin' away by hitting the road
somehow she make it to all of my shows now where can i go
girl it's a simple a matter
put your painted finger on my tongue
so i can taste the lacquer
and relive each door that you have touched
and then she split my lips
and for three whole days
i tried to speak but everyone agreed
they couldn't hear a word i'd say
what's the drive in being alive when you don't know who you are?
what's the fun in getting drunk if you can't take it too far
i'm singing oh i don't know
take me anywhere but home
without a mouth i'm so down
but my hometown only makes me feel alone
then just when i i i i think i'm in the clear she hook her hair behind her ears and says i'm
going down
she said baby it's okay to feel the way you do if you keep it to yourself
life is a bitch with no mouth and no lips
but it sure ain't no fun with no teeth and no tongue
life is a bitch with no mouth and no lips
but it sure ain't no fun with no teeth and no tongue
life is a bitch with no mouth and no lips
life is a bitch with no mouth and no lips
life is a bitch with no mouth and no lips
without a mouth i'm so down
my hometown only makes me feel alone
then just when i i i i think i'm in the clear
she hook her hair behind her ears
says babe are you aware
of who i am


summer has come and passed
the innocent can never last
wake me up when september ends
like my father's come to pass
seven years has gone so fast
wake me up when september ends

here comes the rain again
falling from the stars
drenched in my pain again
becoming who we are
as my memory rests
but never forgets what i lost
wake me up when september ends

summer has come and passed
the innocent can never last
wake me up when september ends
ring out the bells again
like we did when spring began
wake me up when september ends

here comes the rain again
falling from the stars
drenched in my pain again
becoming who we are
as my memory rests
but never forgets what i lost
wake me up when september ends

summer has come and passed
the innocent can never last
wake me up when september ends
like my father's come to pass
twenty years has gone so fast
wake me up when september ends

wake me up when september ends
wake me up when september ends

sometimes
i feel the fear of uncertainty stinging clear
and i can't help but ask myself how much i'll let the fear
take the wheel and steer
it's driven me before and seems to have a vague
haunting mass appeal
but lately i'm beginning to find that i
should be the one behind the wheel
whatever tomorrow brings, i'll be there
with open arms and open eyes, yeah
whatever tomorrow brings, i'll be there
i'll be there
so, if i decide to waiver my
chance to be one of the hive
will i choose water over wine
and hold my own and drive? aah ah ooo
it's driven me before and it seems to be the way
that everyone else gets around
but lately i'm beginning to find
that when i drive myself my light is found
whatever tomorrow brings, i'll be there
with open arms and open eyes, yeah
whatever tomorrow brings, i'll be there
i'll be there
would you choose water over wine?
hold the wheel and drive
whatever tomorrow brings
i'll be there with open arms and open eyes, yeah
whatever tomorrow brings
i'll be there, i'll be there
dododooo dododo dododododo, bum bum bum bum
dododooo dododo dododododo, bum bum bum bum


every time i'm with it alone
it picks me up
you just send me down
i can feel it rushing under my skin
you're a cage won't you let me in?
on my toes
lock the door
pretty face
through the walls
don't know if i'd be so sure again

my eyes are still burning red
so turn the lights out
you're not so hard to forget
with all the lights out

every time i'm stuck in the ground
spin me round, won't you spin me round
you're a void, a crack in the mirror
see me now, if you could see me now
you slipped through
the night
then walked out
skin tight
but you don't matter that much to me
no you don't matter that much to me

my eyes are still burning red
so turn the lights out
you're not so hard to forget
with all the lights out
so turn the lights out
just turn the lights out
my eyes are still burning red
so turn the lights out
you're not so hard to forget
with all the lights out

did you hear the distant cry?
calling me back to my sins
like the ones you knew before
calling me back once again

i nearly
i nearly lost you there
and it's taken us somewhere
i nearly lost you there
well, let's try to sleep now

drag me far enough to know
i'm blind every mile that you burn
there's a rider that's fallen and
it's clear there's no time to return

i nearly
i nearly lost you there
and it's taken us somewhere
i nearly lost you there
well, let's try to sleep now

did you hear the distant lie?
calling me back to my sins

oh yeah, i oh, i nearly lost you there


in the town where i was born
lived a man who sailed to sea
and he told us of his life
in the land of submarines
so we sailed on to the sun
till we found the sea of green
and we played beneath the waves
in our yellow submarine

we all live in a yellow submarine
yellow submarine, a yellow submarine
we all live in a yellow submarine
a yellow submarine, a yellow submarine

and our friends are all aboard
many more of them live next door
and the band began to play

we all live in a yellow submarine
yellow submarine, a yellow submarine
we all live in a yellow submarine
a yellow submarine, a yellow submarine



as we live
a life of ease   a life of ease 
everyone of us  everyone of us 
has all we need  has all we need 
a sky of blue  sky of blue 
a sea of green  sea of green 
in our yellow  in our yellow 
submarine  submarine, ha  ha  

we all live in a yellow submarine

the problem is all inside your head
she said to me
the answer is easy if you
take it logically
i'd like to help you in your struggle
to be free
there must be fifty ways
to leave your lover
she said it's really not my habit
to intrude
furthermore, i hope my meaning
won't be lost or misconstrued
but i'll repeat myself
at the risk of being crude
there must be fifty ways
to leave your lover
fifty ways to leave your lover

you just slip out the back, jack
make a new plan, stan
you don't need to be coy, roy
just get yourself free
hop on the bus, gus
you don't need to discuss much
just drop off the key, lee
and get yourself free
ooh, just slip out the back, jack
make a new plan, stan
you don't need to be coy, roy
just listen to me
hop on the bus, gus
you don't need to discuss much
just drop off the key, lee
and get yourself free

she said it grieves me so
to see you in such pain
i wish there was something i could do
to make you smile again
i said: "i appreciate that
and would you please explain
about the 50 ways"
she said why don't we both
just sleep on it tonight
and i believe in the morning
you'll begin to see the light
and then she kissed me
and i realized she probably was right
there must be fifty ways
to leave your lover
fifty ways to leave your lover

just slip out the back, jack
make a new plan, stan
you don't need to be coy, roy
just get yourself free
oh, you hop on the bus, gus
you don't need to discuss much
just drop off the key, lee
and get yourself free
slip out the back, jack
make a new plan, stan
you don't need to be coy, roy
just listen to me
hop on the bus, gus
you don't need to discuss much
just drop off the key, lee
and get yourself free

i remember when we used to walk together
used to talk together, go to the park together
in all kinds of weather we would share
this common pleasure with most of human kinds
it was a kind of treasure, one that i was surely glad to find
but i got one right here and i'm okay
i'm okay, and you're okay, and we're okay
i'm alright, everything else is alright sometimes
just remember those bones they get broken
and love is not a token of affection
it's not even a real thing, it's a word
so don't you try to buy it out with a ring
'cause it's a verb to love someone
open up and let them in
just don't be afraid to set them free again
that i ain't ever seen
i'm gonna keep on keeping on
i'm gonna reap on being strong
i got my head on, though mis connected
it's alright 'cause i do it protected
i got a day job, i drive a cheap ride
sounds like i'm gonna fine
you only get one life to learn
there's only so many brain cells that you can burn
and life can take a turn and take away that you've earned
and leave you yearning for more, so much more
life is gonna leave you yearning for more, more, more
your stomach's gonna be churning
wanting more, you're wanting, wanting some more
you're wanting some more, more, more
do you want some?
well, i got some right here and i'm okay
i'm okay and you're okay, ha ha, we're okay
everything else will be fine sometimes
guess what i'm doing okay

carry on my wayward son
there'll be peace when you are done
lay your weary head to rest
don't you cry no more

once i rose above the noise and confusion
just to get a glimpse beyond this illusion
i was soaring ever higher
but i flew too high
though my eyes could see i still was a blind man
though my mind could think i still was a mad man
i hear the voices when i'm dreaming
i can hear them say

carry on my wayward son
there'll be peace when you are done
lay your weary head to rest
don't you cry no more

masquerading as a man with a reason
my charade is the event of the season
and if i claim to be a wise man, well
it surely means that i don't know
on a stormy sea of moving emotion
tossed about i'm like a ship on the ocean
i set a course for winds of fortune
but i hear the voices say

carry on my wayward son
there'll be peace when you are done
lay your weary head to rest
don't you cry no more
no 


carry on, you will always remember
carry on, nothing equals the splendor
now your life's no longer empty
but surely heaven waits for you

carry on my wayward son
there'll be peace when you are done
lay your weary head to rest
don't you cry
don't you cry no more

no more 


a rolling rock, electric shocks
she gives a lickin' that don't stop
she light 'em up, push you 'round
smokin' rings goin' 'round and 'round

her hot potatoes
will elevate you
her bad behavior
will leave you standin' proud
an' hard as a rock

hard as a rock
well, it's harder than a rock
hard as a rock
well, it's harder than a rock

the lightnin' rod strike it hot
it's gonna hit you like the rushmore rock
no nicotine and no pipe dreams
so low and dirty, it's down right mean

hell elevator
yeah, i'll see you later
no, i ain't going to take it
yes, i'm
i'm busting out
i'm hard as a rock

hard as a rock
well, it's harder than a rock
hard as a rock
well, it's harder than a rock

hard as a rock
harder than a rock
hard as a rock
yeah
i'm gettin' harder

harder than a rock

well, i'm harder than a rock
hard as a rock
babe, i'm harder than a rock, yeah

hard as a rock

my father had a randall knife
my mother gave it to him
when he went off to world war ii
to save us all from ruin
if you've ever held a randall knife
you know my father well
if a better blade was ever made
it was probably forged in hell

my father was a good man
a lawyer by his trade
only once did i ever see him
misuse the blade
it almost cut his thumb off
when he took it for a tool
ah, the knife was made for darker things
you could not bend the rules

he let me take it camping once
on a boy scout jamboree
and i broke a half an inch off
tryin' to stick it in a tree
i hid it from him for a while
but the knife and he were one
and he just put it in his bottom drawer
without a hard word one
there it slept and there it stayed
for twenty some odd years
sort of like excalibur
except waiting for a tear

now my father died when i was forty
and i couldn't find a way to cry
not because i didn't love him
not because i didn't try
i'd cried for every lesser thing:
whiskey, pain, and beauty
but he deserved a better tear
i was not quite ready

so we took his ashes out to sea
and poured 'em off the stern
and then threw the roses in the wave
of everything we'd learned
and when we got back to the house
and they asked me what i wanted
not the law books, not the watch
i need the things he's haunted
aw, my hand burned for the randall knife
there in the bottom drawer
and i found a tear for my father's life
and everything he stood for


dear mother, can you hear me whining?
it's been three whole weeks
since that i have left your home
this sudden fear has left me trembling
cause now it seems that i am out here on my own
and i'm feeling so alone

pay attention to the cracked streets
and the broken homes
some call it the slums, some call it nice
i want to take you through a wasteland
i like to call my home
welcome to paradise

a gunshot rings out at the station
another urchin snaps and left dead on his own
it makes me wonder why i'm still here
for some strange reason it's now
feeling like my home
and i'm never gonna go 

pay attention to the cracked streets
and the broken homes
some call it the slums, some call it nice
i want to take you through a wasteland
i like to call my home
welcome to paradise


dear mother, can you hear me laughing?
it's been 6 whole months since
since that i have left your home
it makes me wonder why i'm still here
for some strange reason it's now
feeling like my home
and i'm never gonna go 

pay attention to the cracked streets
and the broken homes
some call it the slums, some call it nice
i want to take you through a wasteland
i like to call my home
welcome to paradise
aw, paradise


you take away
i feel the same

you take away
i feel the same
all the promises you made
to me you made in vain
i lost myself inside your
tainted smile again

'cause you can't feel my anger
you can't feel my pain
you can't feel my torment
drivin' me insane
i can't fight these feelin's
they will bring you pain
you can't take away
make me whole again

i feel betrayed
stuck in your ways
and you rip me apart
with the brutal things you say
i can't deal with this shit anymore
i just look away

'cause you can't feel my anger
you can't feel my pain
you can't feel my torment
drivin' me insane
i can't fight these feelin's
they bring only pain
you can't take away
make me whole again

mudshovel, mudshovel, mudshovel, mudshovel
mudshovel, mudshovel, mudshovel, mudshovel

you take away
i feel the same
all these promises
you promised only pain
if you take away
and leave me with nothing again

'cause you can't feel my anger
you can't feel my pain
you can't feel my torment
drivin' me insane
i can't fight these feelin's
they will bring me pain
you can't take away
make me whole again
you will feel my anger
you will feel my pain
you will feel my torment
drivin' you insane
i can't fight these feelin's
they will bring you pain
you won't take away
i'll be whole again

mudshovel, mudshovel, mudshovel, mudshovel
mudshovel, mudshovel, mudshovel, mudshovel


oh, i sincerely miss those heavy metal bands
i used to go see on the landing in the summer
she fell in love with the drummer
she fell in love with the drummer
she fell in love

shiny, shiny pants and bleached blond hair
a double kick drum by the river in the summer
she fell in love with the drummer
another and another
she fell in love

i miss the innocence i've known
playing kiss covers, beautiful and stoned

unlock my body and move myself to dance
moving warm liquid, flowing blowing glass
classical music blasting masks are ringing in my ears

oh, i sincerely miss those heavy metal bands
i used to go see on the landing in the summer
she fell in love with the drummer
she fell in love with another
she fell in love

i miss the innocence i've known

go away bitter memory
i figured finally you'd stay away from me
but i was wrong
you're still strong
go away bitter memory
yeah go away bitter memory
you keep on bothering me
why won't you let me be
you made my cry
why won't you die
go away bitter memory

well bitter memory
you're a thorn in my side
bitter memory
you're the trouble on my mind
find a new place to call home
you're not welcome anymore
let me show you to the door bitter memory
go away bitter memory
why do you have to be a source of misery
leave me alone
let me live on
go away bitter memory
yeah go away bitter memory
and quit constantly interrupting me
don't come around you lonesome sound
go away bitter memory

let me show you to the door bitter memory 


everytime i think about it
i shiver like i've never shook
and all the while we talk about it
it never feels exactly like it should
even if we turned it around
it would only do no good

so baby don't fake it
when you already know
you can't shake it
and it's starting to show
i can't fill that hole in your heart
like i could at the start

i felt a fire burning long before
i even saw the smoke
the tragedy just looming over the horizon
still there's a part of me that hopes
that we could just turn it around
but it would only do no good
just remember there's nobody else
that could love you like i could

so baby don't fake it
when you already know
you can't shake it
and it's starting to show
i can't fill that hole in your heart
like i could at the start
yeah baby don't fake it
when you already know
you can't shake it
and it's starting to show
i can't fill that hole in your heart
like i could at the start

so baby don't fake it
when you already know
you can't shake it
and it's starting to show
i can't fill that hole in your heart
like i could at the start
i can't fill that hole in your heart
like i could at the start
ooohhhhh
ooohhhhh
ooohhhhh
ooohhhhh


i jump from thought to thought like a flea jumps to a light
you could give an aspirin the headache of its life
maybe it's the crazy that i'd miss
watering plastic plants in the hope that they'll grow
seeing a message flash and then smashing up my phone
maybe it's the crazy that i'd miss
it won't get better than this

i like the way your brain works, i like the way you try
to run with the wolf pack when your legs are tied
i like the way you turn me inside and out
i like the way you turn
 woo, ooh ooh, ooh ooh
ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh 
i like the way your brain works
 woo, ooh ooh, ooh ooh
ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh 
i like the way your brain works

i want to get college girl drunk tonight
no morning fears, no mountains to climb
they say the best memories are the ones that we forget
like listening to drake at your best friend's swimming pool
floating anti clockwise in a red mushroom
maybe it's the crazy that i'd miss
it won't get better than this

i like the way your brain works, i like the way you try
to run with the wolf pack when your legs are tied
i like the way you turn me inside and out
i like the way you turn
 woo, ooh ooh, ooh ooh
ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh 
i like the way your brain works
 woo, ooh ooh, ooh ooh
ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh 
i like the way your brain works

baby, it's the crazy i like
i think i saw the world turn in your eyes
baby, it's the crazy i like  ah ah, ah 
and maybe it's the bullshit i'd miss
screaming at the moon in black lipstick
maybe it's the bullshit i'd miss
it won't get better than this

when life is so dull
and i am full
of hate and doubt
you make gold stand out
my night, lights start
sturdy love, patient friend
got cold hands, warm heart
and nothing left to defend
i'm still paralyzed
by your pale eyes
they turn skies
of grey to holidays
my night, lights start
sturdy love, patient friend
got cold hands, warm heart
and nothing left to defend
finally found someone else i can call my own
finally found someone else i can call my own
finally found someone else i can call my own
finally found someone else i can call my own
my night, lights start
sturdy love, patient friend
got cold hands, warm heart
and nothing left to defend
my night, lights start
sturdy love, patient friend
got cold hands, warm heart
and nothing left to defend

she's got the devil on one shoulder
and the other's getting colder
she looks so good but it's not nearly
feeling like it's supposed to
going sold, going sold
going, gone

then she drags me by one finger
to her lips, hook, line and sinker
honey i'm a sucker, when you linger
give me everything i want
cause you know, i won't go
till i'm gone

say my name again
tell me you're caught in the middle
you're caught in the middle
and you're begging for me to stay
cause every now and then
my love calls like a whistle
it calls like a whistle
and it's blowing your mind again

got you crawling in the shadows
to the smoke of the tobacco
burning slowly out the window
and whichever way it blows
there you go, there you go
there you go

i'm a slave to your addiction
your affection and your friction
i've got all the money to buy exactly what i want
but you're not for sale
honey no second chances, oh no

say my name again
tell me you're caught in the middle
you're caught in the middle
and you're begging for me to stay
cause every now and then
my love calls like a whistle
it calls like a whistle
and it's blowing your mind again

she's got the devil on one shoulder
and the other's getting colder
she looks so good but it's not nearly
feeling like it's supposed to
going sold, going sold
going

say my name again
tell me you're caught in the middle
you're caught in the middle
and you're begging for me to stay
cause every now and then
my love calls like a whistle
it calls like a whistle
and it's blowing your mind again

the wolves look to the moon
and the ocean to the sky
i've looked to you my whole life
now i have to say goodbye
but to say that i've lost you
it's  such a selfish thing to say
i've never seen nothing as beautiful
as watching you slip away
 oooh ooh ooh 
i'd rather see you go in the arms of your angels
than to keep you right here with me
i'll meet you on the other side of the jordan
now let your soul go free
you did it all with feeling
and failure, you took it gracefully
you said third star to the right
and straight on until morning
when you need me, you know
that's where i'll be
now the rest of my life without you
right now it's hard to conceive
you said, don't cry form me now
you've got to remember
there is no death for those that believe
i'd rather see you go in the arms of your angels
than to keep you right here with me
i'll meet you on the other side of the jordan
now let your soul go free, let your soul go free
meet you on the other side of the jordan
now let your soul be free
rather see you go in the arms of your angels
than to keep you right here with me
on the other side of the jordan
now let your soul go free
in the arms of your angels
than to keep you right here with me
meet you on the other side of the jordan
than to keep you right here with me
rather see you go in the arms of your angels
let your soul be free
meet you on the other side of the jordan
let your soul be free
rather see you go in the arms of your angels
than to keep you right here with me

track nine is "drown." "drown" originally came before the album. lyrically, it fits really well with the concept of the album, "the celebration of depression." if we wrote 10 other bangers, "drown" would go on.
the lyrics are exactly the same as the old one.

i'm just a broken machine

now it's time to go

take a little spark
from a battery

add some vanity
authenticity

this is the greatest and best song in the world...
tribute

long time ago, me and my brother kyle here
we was hitchhikin' down a long and lonesome road
all of a sudden, there shined a shiny demon
in the middle of the road
and he said
"play the best song in the world
or i'll eat your soul"  soul 
well, me and kyle
we looked at each other
and we each said
"okay"
and we played the first thing
that came to our heads
just so happened to be
the best song in the world
it was the best song in the world

look into my eyes
and it's easy to see
one and one make two
two and one make three
it was destiny
once every hundred thousand years or so
when the sun doth shine
and the moon doth glow
and the grass doth grow

needless to say
the beast was stunned
a whip crack went his whippy tail
and the beast was done
he asked us
"snort
be you angels?"
and we said
"nay
we are but men "
rock
ahhh, ahhh, ahhh ah ah
ohhh, whoah
ah whoah oh

this is not
the greatest song in the world, no
this is just a tribute
couldn't remember
the greatest song in the world, no, no
this is a tribute, oh
to the greatest song in the world
alright
it was the greatest song in the world
alright
yeah it was the best motherfuckin' song
the greatest song in the world

ah rah, dee
soo guh goo gee goo gee
goo guh fli goo gee goo
guh fli goo, ga goo buh dee
ooh, guh goo bee
ooh guh guh bee guh guh bee
fli goo gee goo
a fliguh woo wa mama lucifer 

and the peculiar thing is this my friends
the song we sang on that fateful night
it didn't actually sound anything like this song 

this is just a tribute
you've got to believe me
and i wish you were there
just a matter of opinion
ah, fuck 
good god
gotta love it
so surprised to find you can't stop it
oh hallelujah, i'm found
rich motherfucker, aw
alright
alright



the anger, the pressure
you're choking down your words again
feel the nerves set in
unspoken frustration
they see right through you
paper thin, like the ghost within

a heart that feels no pain
addicted to the game
breaking beneath the strain
i am paralyzed

the stare of a stranger
is like a wound that bleeds again
silent as the dead
the victim, the martyr
like daniel in the lion's den
time and time again

a heart that feels no pain
addicted to the game
breaking beneath the strain
i am paralyzed, i am paralyzed


a heart that feels no pain
addicted to the game
relentless mental drain
what do you stand to gain?
viewing life through such a narrow, fractured lens
will ensure you end up on the losing end
breaking beneath the strain
i am paralyzed, i am paralyzed
i am paralyzed, i am paralyzed
i am paralyzed


in the folds of mythology
never died, never born
demented god, a monstrosity
oh, you block the sun

octopus, the point of no return
you're the hunger, the one
there you wait, for moon and man to fall
from the wall of the world

guardian of nyx
epic in the abyss
at the earthfall
there's a mountain of skulls
you swallow the earth
astorolus
astorolus


guardian of nyx
epic in the abyss
at the earthfall
there's a mountain of skulls
you swallow the earth
astorolus
astorolus

spearhead, beak and tusk
your arms, like silver in dusk
into the depths we are thrust
astorolus
astorolus
you will swallow us
great octopus



there used to be a graying tower alone on the sea
you became the light on the dark side of me
love remained a drug that's the high and not the pill

but did you know that when it snows
my eyes become large and
the light that you shine can't be seen?

baby, i compare you to a kiss from a rose on the gray
ooh, the more i get of you, the stranger it feels, yeah
and now that your rose is in bloom
a light hits the gloom on the gray

there is so much a man can tell you
so much he can say
you remain my power, my pleasure, my pain, baby
to me you're like a growing addiction that i can't deny
won't you tell me is that healthy, baby?

but did you know that when it snows
my eyes become large and
the light that you shine can't be seen?

baby, i compare you to a kiss from a rose on the gray
ooh, the more i get of you, the stranger it feels, yeah
and now that your rose is in bloom
a light hits the gloom on the gray

i've been kissed by a rose on the gray
i, i've been kissed by a rose on the gray
i've ...  and if i should fall along the way  ... been kissed by a rose on the gray
i, i've been kissed by a rose on the gray

there is so much a man can tell you
so much he can say
you remain my power, my pleasure, my pain
to me you're like a growing addiction that i can't deny, yeah
won't you tell me is that healthy, baby?

but did you know that when it snows
my eyes become large and
the light that you shine can't be seen?

baby, i compare you to a kiss from a rose on the gray
ooh, the more i get of you, the stranger it feels, yeah
and now that your rose is in bloom
a light hits the gloom on the gray
yes, i compare you to a kiss from a rose on the gray
ooh, the more i get of you, the stranger it feels, yeah
and now that your rose is in bloom
a light hits the gloom on the gray

now that your rose is in bloom
a light hits the gloom on the gray

to get you where i want you?

woah, woah

you're a million miles, a million miles away
so come closer, so come closer
so come close, ah, woah, ah, woah

i'll never rely on you
and you're draped on him while you're staring at me

so come closer, so come closer

there is a wall that runs right through me
just like this city, i will never be joined
what is this love? why can i never hold it?
did it really run out in those strangers' bedrooms?

i
i have decided
at 25
that something must change

saturday night, in east berlin
we took the u bahn to the east side gallery
i was sure i'd found love with this one lying with me
crying again in the hauptbahnhof

i
i have decided
at 25
that something must change

after sex, the bitter taste
been fooled again, the search continues
after sex, the bitter taste
been fooled again, the search continues
after sex, the bitter taste
been fooled again, the search continues
concerned mothers of the west
teach your sons how to truly love


don't think, don't speak, watch out
don't blink, dissent is a cry for the dead
chin up, back straight, don't ask, just hate
the serpent's alive, you are all crucified

tear down the walls again
and all that remains

he'll see your good deeds and raise you two rights
he'll lose it all just to stay in the fight
and if you're still blind, sing praise from your knees
his heel in your back from once where you stood free

building your walls again
and all that remains

broken, broken
leave the lies
no use in defending
shattered, fragile to the core


so hail, hail to deathmocracy
hell for your thought crimes, hail to your piety
oh, the irony, the antidote is the disease
the balancing of ignorance and atrophy

tear down the walls again
it's more of the same

broken, broken
leave the lies
no use in defending
shattered, fragile to the core

to the basement people, to the basement, many surprises await you

someday, someday
yeah, it hurts to say, but i want you to stay
sometimes, sometimes
when we was young, oh man, did we have fun
always, always
promises, they break before they're made
sometimes, sometimes

oh, maya says i'm lacking in depth
i will do my best
you say you wanna stand by my side
darling, your head's not right

yeah, i think i'll be alright

tables, they turn sometimes, oh, someday

 trying, trying 

and now my fears, they come to me in threes
so i sometimes

fell in love with a girl
i fell in love once and almost completely
she's in love with the world
but sometimes, these feelings can be so misleading
she turns and says, "are you alright?"
i said, "i must be fine 'cause my heart's still beating."
"come and kiss me by the riverside
bobby says it's fine, he don't consider it cheating."

red hair with a curl
mello roll for the flavor
and the eyes were peeping
can't keep away from the girl
these two sides of my brain need to have a meeting

can't think of anything to do, yeah
my left brain knows that all love is fleeting
she's just looking for something new, yeah
i said it once before
but it bears repeating, now
can't think of anything to do, yeah
my left brain knows that all love is fleeting
she's just looking for something new

we are young, we run green
keep our teeth nice and clean
see our friends, see the sights
and feel alright

we wake up, we go out
smoke a fag, put it out
see our friends, see the sights
and feel alright

are we like you?
i can't be sure
of the scene as she turns
we are strange in our worlds

but we are young, we get by
can't go mad, ain't got time
sleep around if we like
but we're alright

got some cash, bought some wheels
took it out 'cross the fields
lost control, hit a wall
but we're alright

are we like you?
i can't be sure
of the scene as she turns
we are strange in our worlds

but we are young, we run green
keep our teeth nice and clean
see our friends, see the sights
and feel alright

are we like you?
i can't be sure
of the scene as she turns
we are strange in our worlds

but we are young, we run green
keep our teeth nice and clean
see our friends, see the sights
and feel alright...


so i walked into the haze
and a million dirty waves
now i see you lying there
like a lilo losing air, air
black rocks and the shoreline surf
still dead summer i cannot bear
and i wipe the sand from my eyes
the spanish sahara, the place that you'd wanna
leave the horror here

forget the horror here
forget the horror here
leave it all down here
it's future rust and it's future dust
forget the horror here
forget the horror here
leave it all down here
it's future rust and it's future dust

now the waves they drag you down
carry you to broken ground
but i'll find you in the sand
wipe you clean with dirty hands
so god damn this boiling space
the spanish sahara, the place that you'd wanna
leave the horror here

forget the horror here
forget the horror here
leave it all down here
it's future rust and it's future dust

i'm the fury in your head
i'm the fury in your bed
i'm the ghost in the back of your head
'cause i am
i'm the fury in your head
i'm the fury in your bed
i'm the ghost in the back of your head
'cause i am
i'm the fury in your head
i'm the fury in your bed
i'm the ghost in the back of your head
'cause i am

forget the horror here
forget the horror here
leave it all down here
it's future rust, it's future dust

a choir of furies in your head
a choir of furies in your bed
i'm the ghost in the back of your head
'cause i am
a choir of furies in your head
a choir of furies in your bed
i'm the ghost in the back of your head
'cause i am
a choir of furies in your head
a choir of furies in your bed
i'm the ghost in the back of your head
'cause i am

we were at the table by the window with the view
casting shadows, the sun was pushing through
spoke a lot of words, i don't know if i spoke the truth

got so much to lose
got so much to prove
god, don't let me lose my mind

trouble on my left, trouble on my right
i've been facing trouble almost all my life
my sweet love, won't you pull me through?
everywhere i look, i catch a glimpse of you
i said it was love and i did it for life  did did it for you 

we will come to pass, will i pass the test?
you know what they say, yeah
the wicked get no rest
you can have my heart, any place, any time

got so much to lose
got so much to prove
god, don't let me lose my mind

trouble on my left, trouble on my right
i've been facing trouble almost all my life
my sweet love, won't you pull me through?
everywhere i look, i catch a glimpse of you
i said it was love and i did it for life  did did it for you 

trouble on my left, trouble on my right
i've been facing trouble almost all my life
my sweet love, won't you pull me through?
everywhere i look, i catch a glimpse of you
i said it was love and i did it for life  did did it for you 

got so much to lose
got so much to prove
god, don't let me lose my mind


you might kill me with desire
wind me tighter than a wire
it's something that you do to me
i run away like mercury
and i know you think it's rough
when you're tryna patch us up
and i say, "honey, what is love?"
you just say i drink too much

maybe i'm defective
or maybe i'm dumb
i'm sorry, so sorry for what i've done
maybe i'm bad natured
or maybe i'm young
i'm sorry, so sorry for what i've done

and on the t shirt that i wear
pick the thorns out of my hair
i broke your heart so carelessly
but made the pieces part of me
and now it hurts what we've become
'cause you taught me how to love
it's me who taught you how to stop
and you just say i drink too much

maybe i'm defective
or maybe i'm dumb
i'm sorry, so sorry for what i've done
maybe i'm bad natured
or maybe i'm young
i'm sorry, so sorry for what i've done

i've waited for this
i'm ready for it
i've waited for this
i'm ready for it
i've been waiting so long
i've waited for this
i'm ready for it
i've waited for this
i'm ready for it
i've been waiting so long

maybe i'm defective
or maybe i'm dumb
i'm sorry, so sorry for what i've done
maybe i'm bad natured
or maybe i'm young
i'm sorry, so sorry for what i've done

you think that you can have it
but you have no time
to hold control
you think you own me
let me tell you what i think
so that you know
let me take my time
let me mend my soul
let me keep it straight
and let the feelings flow
let me take the time
to let it go
torn into pieces my heart
to keep it, go on
let me find the selfness i forgot
it keeps on going
behind the curtains, avid
to conceal my mind
not give it way
but something keeps on
telling me to let in out
to let it grow
let me take my time
let me mend my soul
let me keep it straight
and let the feelings flow
let me take the time
to let it go
torn into pieces my heart
to keep it, go on
let me find the selfness i forgot
it keeps on going
without eyes
i make my way in wonder
burn my mind
in my search for solutions
life unwinds
i struggle with my passion
time, forever a cage
in which i belong
my understanding fails me
but i need no path
to pursue my goal
my vanity is jaded
and it hurts my pride
it fades my glow
let me take my time
let me mend my soul
let me keep it straight
and let the feelings flow
let me take the time
to let it go
torn into pieces my heart
to keep it, go on
let me find the selfness i forgot
it keeps on going
torn into pieces my heart
to keep it, go on
let me find the selfness i forgot
it keeps on going
go 

open your mind and pay attention
what do you see and what do you hear?
conspiracy plots in this culture of fear
reunite with yourself
reconnect with ourselves
facing the blind of collective delusion
i need my freedom from this evil deception
i am the enemy
i am the enemy
powered by thoughts of revolution
building all bridges of error
search and destroy my sick innerself
to realize i'm not a fraud
reunite with yourself
reconnect with ourselves
reorganize our lies
rehumanize our lives
reprogram your aim
rewrite our law
reprogram your aim
rewrite our law
facing the blind of collective delusion
i need my freedom from this evil deception
i am the enemy
i am the enemy
reprogram your aim
rewrite our law
you are human

vacate is the word
vengeance has no place in me to hurt
cannot find the comfort in this world
artificial tears
vessel stabbed, next up, volunteers?
vulnerable, wisdom can't adhere
a truant finds home and a wish to hold onto
but there's a trapdoor in the sun
it's immortality 
as privileged as a whore
victims in demand for public show
swept out through the cracks beneath the door
holier than thou, how?
surrendered, executed, anyhow 
scrawl resolved, cigar box on the floor
a truant finds home and a wish to hold onto
there's a trapdoor in the sun
it's immortality...
i cannot stop the thought running in the dark
coming up a which way sign
all good truants must decide
oh, stripped and sold, mom 
auctioned forearm and whiskers in the sink
truant moves on, cannot stay long
some die just to live 
oh 


one o'clock in the morning
and i'm leaving from the club
my friends are having a party
kind of feel i've had enough

at two o'clock in the morning
sure i'm at the party house
i meet the roommate getting some water
she got a baby in her stomach
oh oh oh oh oah oh
oh oh oh oh oah oh
oh oh oh oh oah oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh

three o'clock in the morning
we hear a scream above the sounds
looks like the baby in her belly
thinks it's time to come on out

four o'clock in the morning
i'm driving all over the road
i swerve a dog on the high street
and crash into the post
oh oh oh oh oah oh
oh oh oh oh oah oh
oh oh oh oh oah oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh

she can't wait any longer
i got to help her come into the world
the police try to arrest us
but then they see the baby girl

five o'clock in the morning
i'm drinking coffee on the ward
i take a walk in to see her
tells me 'bout the dad that took off
oh oh oh oh oah oh
oh oh oh oh oah oh
oh oh oh oh oah oh
all in one night
all in one night

six o'clock in the morning
and now we're 22 months along
she asked me to be the daddy
and get married when it snows
oh oh oh oh oah oh
oh oh oh oh oah oh
oh oh oh oh oah oh
all in one night
all in one night
all in one night
all in one night, one night
all in one night
oh oh oh oh oah oh
oh oh oh oh oah oh
oh oh oh oh oah oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oah oh
oh oh oh oh oah oh
oh oh oh oh oah oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oah oh
oh oh oh oh oah oh...

i fell through the ice
she won't be coming back again
it never wins to lie
she said you'll never have no rights
 she said you'll never have no rights, no rights 
i've took it farther on the outside
i've took it nearly to the brink
and if you've seen me on the outside
you would have barely seen me breathe
funny right here i find myself
inside a paper cup
without a warning or a reason
it's a treason
with no answer
you got no right
to keep me waiting here
you got no right
to keep the pain in here
that holds the crown
and if i fall apart on the outside
 you really don't believe me 
and if i take it to the brink
and if i fall apart on the outside
 you really don't believe me 
you would have barely seen me breathe
and if i meet you out tonight
will you be loving me forever?
it's always over after the night
it's always colder after the night
i broke through the ice
she won't be coming back again
it's been a year and a night
and if i fall apart on the outside
 you really don't believe me 
and if i take it to the brink
and if i fall apart on the outside
 you really don't believe me 
you would have barely seen me breathe
and if i fall apart on the outside
 she said you'll never have no rights 
and if i fall apart on the outside
 she said you'll never have no rights 
and if i fall apart on the outside
 she said you'll never have no rights 
and if i fall apart on the outside


i can't get there on my own
you can't leave me here alone
i m just trying to do what s right
oh a man ain t a man 'less he s fought the fight

i could never point you out
waste of space in a faceless crowd
tell me what i have to say
if you know what s right, then you ll walk away

when the walls come down
when the walls come down
when the walls come down
when the walls come down

one by one i've seen em fall
some just don t show up at all
i m just here to fight the fire
oh a man ain t a man 'less he has desire

and the walls come down
and the walls come down
when the walls come down
when the walls come down

you tore out my heart
and you threw it away
the western girl with eastern eyes
took a wrong turn and found surprise awaits
now there s nothing in the way
in the way
in the way
in the way

when the walls come down
when the walls come down
when the walls come down
when the walls come down

you tore out my heart
you threw it away
the western girl with eastern eyes
took a wrong turn and found surprise awaits
now there s nothing in the way
in the way
in the way
in the way

take a look
at what i got
i can't promise
you a lot
but you and me
and the road ahead
i can't change
you from yourself
you gotta want it
all that's left
is you and me
and the road ahead
wherever that wind might blow
wherever that river rolls
you know i will go with you
lookin' over
the mountain's crown
the water roars
and tumbles down
like you and me
and the road ahead
wherever that wind might blow
wherever that river rolls
you know i will go with you
just you and me
and the road ahead
just you and me
and the road ahead


in the folds of mythology
never died, never born
demented god, a monstrosity
oh, you block the sun

octopus, the point of no return
you're the hunger, the one
there you wait, for moon and man to fall
from the wall of the world

guardian of nyx
epic in the abyss
at the earthfall
there's a mountain of skulls
you swallow the earth
astorolus

how many special people change?
how many lives are living strange?
where were you while we were getting high?
slowly walking down the hall
faster than a cannonball
where were you while we were getting high?

someday you will find me
caught beneath the landslide
in a champagne supernova in the sky
someday you will find me
caught beneath the landslide
in a champagne supernova
a champagne supernova in the sky

wake up the dawn and ask her why
a dreamer dreams she never dies
wipe that tear away now from your eye
slowly walking down the hall
faster than a cannonball
where were you while we were getting high?

someday you will find me
caught beneath the landslide
in a champagne supernova in the sky
someday you will find me
caught beneath the landslide
in a champagne supernova

'cause people believe
that they're gonna get away for the summer
but you and i, we live and die
the world's still spinning 'round, we don't know why
why? why? why? why?

yeah, yeah, yeah
it's about the time we'd like to present you to the electric church
and baby if you would you all listen to our notes
here, here in our sins, playing
instead of rapping like i am now
then maybe i'll well maybe this is good enough
what you think we stick with songs
it's all freedom
there's a red house, over yonder baby
that's where my baby stays
lord, there's a red house over yonder, baby
lord, that's where my baby stays
i haven't been home to see my baby
in about a ninety nine and one half days
it's about time to see her

wait a minute something's wrong, babe
lord, have mercy, this key won't unlock this door


it barks at no one else but me
like it's seen a ghost
i guess it's seen the sparks a flowin
no one else would know

hey man, slow down, slow down
idiot, slow down, slow down

sometimes i get overcharged
that's when you see sparks
they ask me where the hell i'm going
at a 1000 feet per second

hey man, slow down, slow down
idiot, slow down, slow down
hey man, slow down, slow down
idiot, slow down, slow down

truth
yeah i don t want to be here
but there s you
you seem to live inside my atmosphere
we might fall
we might break
we don t give what we take
we just answer with questions and make mistakes
are you pure?
are you marked?
do you know who you are?
do you know who you are now?
i hope that you can see
the better sides of me
am i your make believe?
are you my everything?
strange, we seem to live inside a cycle
i m drained, can feel us spinning round in circles
we grow old, we find hate
we don t fix what we break
we re malevolent seething, is it too late?
are you pure, am i marked?
do we know who we are?
do we know who we are now?
i hope that you can see
the better sides of me
am i your everything?
are you my make believe?


looking out the door i see the rain fall upon the funeral mourners
parading in a wake of sad relations as their shoes fill up with water
maybe i'm too young to keep good love from going wrong
but tonight you're on my mind so you never know
broken down and hungry for your love with no way to feed it
where are you tonight, child you know how much i need it
too young to hold on and too old to just break free and run
sometimes a man gets carried away, when he feels like he should be having his fun
and much too blind to see the damage he's done
sometimes a man must awake to find that really, he has no one

so i'll wait for you and i'll burn
will i ever see your sweet return
oh will i ever learn

oh lover, you should've come over
cause it's not too late

lonely is the room, the bed is made, the open window lets the rain in
burning in the corner is the only one who dreams he had you with him
my body turns and yearns for a sleep that will never come
it's never over, my kingdom for a kiss upon her shoulder
it's never over, all my riches for her smiles when i slept so soft against her
it's never over, all my blood for the sweetness of her laughter
it's never over, she's the tear that hangs inside my soul
forever
well maybe i'm just too young
to keep good love from going wrong

oh... lover, you should've come over
cause it's not too late

well i feel too young to hold on
and i'm much too old to break free and run
too deaf, dumb, and blind to see the damage i've done
sweet lover, you should've come over
oh, love well i'm waiting for you

lover, lover, lover
lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover
lover, lover, lover you should've come over
cause it's not too late

love, let me sleep tonight on your couch
and remember the smell of the fabric
of your simple city dress
oh... that was so real
we walked around til the moon got full like a plate
the wind blew an invocation and i fell asleep at the gate
and i never stepped on the cracks cause i thought i'd hurt my mother
and i couldn't awake from the nightmare that sucked me in and pulled me under
pulled me under
oh... that was so real
i love you, but i'm afraid to love you
i love you, but i'm afraid to love you
i'm afraid...
oh... that was so real


wreckage my mind
insecure all the time
once loved now paralyzed
i once thought i'll never die
frustrated our simple life
no one listens everyone lies
who said home is where you hide?
strong as shit and now you see

i'm home, leave it to me
 leave it to me now that you've seen 
i'm home, leave it to me
 leave it to me 
from left to right
from left to right
from left to right
from left to right

i tried my father said
i'm scared she always said
they grab and pull until i tear
meaning too deep to swim
when is a good time for the end?
who said i was your friend?

i'm home, leave it to me
 leave it to me now that you've seen 
i'm home, leave it to me
 leave it to me 
from left to right
from left to right
from left to right
from left to right

suffocated our simple life
no one listens everyone dies
 never a chance how could you see? 

i'm home, leave it to me
 leave it to me now that you've seen 
i'm home, leave it to me
 leave it to me 
 what the fuck did you say? 
from left to right
from left to right
from left to right
from left to right
from left to right
from left to right
from left to right
from left to right


quit moaning about fate and change
stand up on your feet and rise
with every fall you get the pain, you learn the lesson
start now, open your eyes
dead bodies falling from the sky
we are the ape with the vision of the killing
a rain of shame that fills the mines
no other blood in me but mine

time to open your eyes to this genocide
when you clear your mind, you see it all
you're receiving the gold of a better life
when you change yourself, you change the world

your heart is pounding in the brain
as they drag you naked in the mud
a devil's dancing in the rain
how could you fall so low?

no, we will never let go
let us watch them die


time to open your eyes to this genocide
when you clear your mind, you see it all
you're receiving the gold of a better life
when you change yourself, you change the world

is there anybody out there?
is there anybody out there?
is there anybody out there?
is there anybody out there?
come on
come on
come on
is there anybody there?
come on
here's a little something
i was born as a bastard, no father, no master
a shadow in silence left searching for answers
put up for adoption and left with no option
another kid fostered to fester, forgotten
take a look into these desperate eyes
as they re cast into the wretched hive
but i ain t going down alone
is there anybody out there?
anybody listening to me?
is anybody else scared?
the paranoia drops me to my knees
does anybody feel lonely?
disconnected from the things i see
is there anybody out there?
anybody out there just like me?
i m choking on these words and i can t breathe
come on
come on
come on
is there anybody there?
come on
come on
lemme say this
now i stand as a father, to men with no honor
ashamed of the racists i used to call brothers
'cause no flag can mean bravery
when bloodied by slavery
the rebel, a devil, disguised as a savior
and the sickening feeling in the air
is the fear to speak that no one dares
so will i stand here all alone?
is there anybody out there?
anybody listening to me?
is anybody else scared?
the paranoia drops me to my knees
does anybody feel lonely?
disconnected from the things i see
is there anybody out there?
anybody out there just like me?
i m choking on these words and i can t breathe
live my life like i ll die tonight
dream like i ll live forever
live my life like i ll die tonight
dream like i ll live forever
 is there anybody out there? 
i have roared at the world for years
 is there anybody out there? 
doesn t anybody hear me?
 is there anybody out there? 
this burden suffered, i ve paid the cost
 is there anybody out there? 
not all who wander are lost
is there anybody
is there anybody
is there anybody
is there anybody out there?
anybody listening to me?
is anybody else scared?
the paranoia drops me to my knees
does anybody feel lonely?
disconnected from the things i see
is there anybody out there?
anybody out there just like me?
i m choking on these words and i can t breathe
come on
come on
come on
is there anybody there?
come on
come on
is there anybody
is there anybody
is there anybody out there?


oh yeah

i can't recall the last time i was caught between the walls
those razors in the pillowcases seem to cut 'em all
but old foes, dead things, take a toll
remember, it's just a game

been a long time since i rock and rolled
it's only rock and roll but i like it, like it
don't talk   walk, don't feel   real
don't stay   say, you'll need it anyway

oh, it's my own damn fault
i guess it's good to be the enemy
that don't mean it ain't so bad, bad, bad
because it's all downhill from here, motherfucker
it's all downhill from here  motherfucker 
it's all downhill from here
it's all downhill, you can't get home from here

your beast is just a burden that you never keep in line
this 'fabulous' is really less, gets 'em every time
you roll your eyes for money, don't act like you're impressed
you spread your legs for tv time, baby, who fucks you best?

been a long time since i rock and rolled
it's only rock and roll but i like it, like it
don't talk   walk, don't feel   real
don't stay   say, you'll need it anyway

oh, it's my own damn fault
i guess it's good to be the enemy
that don't mean it ain't so bad, bad, bad
because it's all downhill from here, motherfucker
it's all downhill from here  motherfucker 
it's all downhill from here
it's all downhill, you can't get home from here

oh, it's my own damn fault
i guess it's good to be the enemy
that don't mean it ain't so bad, bad, bad
admit it, when you fall
you'll make peace with your gravity
we all know it drives you mad, mad, mad
because it's all downhill from here, motherfucker
it's all downhill from here  motherfucker 
it's all downhill from here
it's all downhill from here  motherfucker 
you can't get home from here, motherfucker
you can't get home from here  motherfucker 
you can't get home from here
you can't get home from here

i got a little change in my pocket going jing a ling a ling
wanna call you on the telephone, baby, i give you a ring
but each time we talk, i get the same old thing
always, "no huggee, no kissee until i get a wedding ring"
my honey, my baby
don't put my love upon no shelf
she said
"don't hand me no lines and keep your hands to yourself"
ooh, baby, baby, baby
why you gonna treat me this way?
you know i'm still your loverboy
i still feel the same way
that's when she told me a story 'bout free milk and a cow
and said
"no huggee, no kissee until i get a wedding vow"
my honey, my baby
don't put my love upon no shelf
she said
"don't hand me no lines and keep your hands to yourself"
you see, i wanted her real bad and i was about to give in
that's when she started talking about true love
started talking about sin
i said
"honey, i'll live with you for the rest of my life"
she said
no huggee, no kissee until you make me a wife"
my honey, my baby
don't put my love upon no shelf
she said
"don't hand me no lines and keep your hands to yourself"

when you can't find the light
that guides you through a cloudy day
when the stars ain't shinin' bright
and you feel like you've lost you're way
when those candle lights of home
burn so very far away
well you got to let your soul shine
just like my daddy used to say
he used to say soul shine
it's better than sunshine
it's better than moonshine
damn sure better than rain
hey now people don't mind
we all feel this way sometimes
got to let your soul shine
shine 'till the break of day
i grew up thinkin' that i had it made
gonna make it on my own
life can take the strongest man
make him feel so alone
now and then i feel a cold wind
blowin' through my achin' bones
i think back to what my daddy said
he said "boy, in the darkness before the dawn"
let your soul shine
it's better than sunshine
it's better than moonshine
damn sure better than rain
hey now people don't mind
we all get this way sometimes
gotta let your soul shine
shine 'till the break of day
sometimes a man can feel this emptiness
like a woman has robbed him of his very soul
a woman too, god knows, she can feel like this
and when your world seems cold
you got to let your spirit take control
talkinbout soul shine
it's better than sunshine
it's better than moonshine
damn sure better than rain
lord now people don't mind
we all feel this way sometimes
gotta let your soul shine
shine till the break of day
i said it's better than sunshine
it's better than moonshine
damn sure better than rain
yeah now people don't mind
we all get this way sometimes
gotta let your soul shine
shine 'till the break of day


and it's been awhile since i could hold my head up high
and it's been awhile since i first saw you
and it's been awhile since i could stand on my own two feet again
and it's been awhile since i could call you

and everything i can't remember
as fucked up as it all may seem
the consequences that are rendered
i've stretched myself beyond my means

and it's been awhile since i can say that i wasn't addicted
and it's been awhile since i can say i love myself as well and
and it's been awhile since i've gone and fucked things up just like i always do
and it's been a while, but all that shit seems to disappear when i'm with you

and everything i can't remember
as fucked up as it all may seem
the consequences that i've rendered
i've gone and fucked things up again, again

why must i feel this way?
just make this go away
just one more peaceful day

and it's been awhile since i could look at myself straight
and it's been awhile since i said i'm sorry
and it's been awhile since i've seen the way the candles light your face
and it's been awhile, but i can still remember just the way you taste

and everything i can't remember
as fucked up as it all may seem to be, and i know it's me
i cannot blame this on my father
he did the best he could for me

and it's been awhile since i could hold my head up high
and it's been awhile since i said i'm sorry

there's the moon asking to stay
long enough for the clouds to fly me away
well it's my time coming, i'm not afraid, afraid to die
my fading voice sings of love
but she cries to the clicking of time, oh, time
wait in the fire, wait in the fire
wait in the fire, wait in the fire
and she weeps on my arm
walking to the bright lights in sorrow
oh drink a bit of wine we both might go tomorrow
oh my love
and the rain is falling and i believe my time has come
it reminds me of the pain i might leave, leave behind
wait in the fire, wait in the fire
wait in the fire, wait in the fire
and i feel them drown my name
so easy to know and forget with this kiss
i'm not afraid to go but it goes so slow
wait in the fire, wait in the fire, oh oh yea oh oh oh yeah unh
wait, wait, wait in the fire, wait in the fire
wait in the fire, wait ah uh unh ah


can't get the stink off
he's been hanging 'round for days
comes like a comet
suckered you but not your friends
one day he'll get to you
and teach you how to be a holy cow

you do it to yourself, you do
and that's what really hurts
is that you do it to yourself, just you
you and no one else
you do it to yourself
you do it to yourself

don't get my sympathy
hanging out the fifteenth floor
you've changed the locks three times
he still comes reeling through the door
one day i'll get to you
and teach you how to get to purest hell

you do it to yourself, you do
and that's what really hurts
is that you do it to yourself, just you
you and no one else
you do it to yourself
you do it to yourself

you do it to yourself, you do
and that's what really hurts
is that you do it to yourself, just you
you and no one else
you do it to yourself
you do it to yourself
self

the hour has begun
your eyes have now opened

to a world where madness craves
to a world where hope's enslaved
oh, i'll tremble for my love always
your window's opened wide
your innocence takes flight


 alt: "it's a world where..." 


today is gonna be the day that they're gonna throw it back to you
by now, you should have somehow realised what you gotta do
i don't believe that anybody feels the way i do, about you now

backbeat, the word is on the street that the fire in your heart is out
i'm sure you've heard it all before but you never really had a doubt
i don't believe that anybody feels the way i do, about you now

and all the roads we have to walk are winding
and all the lights that lead us there are blinding
there are many things that i would like to say to you
but i don't know how

because maybe
you're gonna be the one that saves me
and after all
you're my wonderwall

today was gonna be the day but they'll never throw it back to you
by now you should've somehow realised what you're not to do
i don't believe that anybody feels the way i do, about you now

and all the roads that lead you there were winding
and all the lights that light the way are blinding
there are many things that i would like to say to you
but i don't know how

you're gonna be the one that saves me
and after all
you're my wonderwall

eddie boy lit like paraffin
spending two weeks
in a crack house
burns on his brain
like chernobyl
dean was seen
with a two bag purchase
he was lying dead on his mother's bed
someone for pray for

memory a swinging door
i could be your great misfortune
i can make you happy
every day of your life 
makin' my love
like a shining star;
taking my love
just a touch too far
tessie turns tricks with a soul like ice
'cause love left holes
and four small kids breaking her heart
i've got windows, i've seen much vice
i've touched down with vermin
cowardice, lice
and i say
nobody cares what you do
please be yourself to death
i could be your great misfortune ...
but you'll never find a, bet you'll never find a better man 
makin' my love

peter met frank
formed a dummy run gang
worked heist or hit for 10 g's flat
blew heads out of shape for the name of trotsky, sinn fein, hitler cash down
no hope heroes cover the page
with debts in hell
and fingers in blood
poor little bodies all covered in scabs
threw it all away
for life in the grave  life in the grave 
life is like a broken arrow
memory a swinging door
i could be your great misfortune
well, i could make you happy
every goddamn single day of your life

no new year's day to celebrate
no chocolate covered candy hearts to give away
no first of spring, no song to sing
in fact here's just another ordinary day

no april rain, no flowers bloom
no wedding saturday within the month of june
but what it is is something new
made up of these three words i say to you

i just called to say i love you
i just called to say how much i care
i just called to say i love you
and i mean it from the bottom of my heart

no summer's high
no warm july
no harvest moon to light one tender august night
no autumn breeze
no falling leaves
not even time for birds to fly to southern skies
no libra sun
no halloween
no giving thanks to all the christmas joy you bring
but what it is, though old so new
to fill your heart like no three words could ever do

i just called to say i love you
i just called to say how much i care
i just called to say i love you
and i mean it from the bottom of my heart

i just called to say i love you
i just called to say how much i care
i just called to say i love you
and i mean it from the bottom of my heart

 she said  i don't know if i've ever been good enough
i'm a little bit rusty, and i think my head is caving in
and i don't know if i've ever been really loved
by a hand that's touched me, well i feel like something's
gonna give
and i'm a little bit angry, well
this ain't over, no not here, not while i still need you
around
you don't owe me, we might change
yeah we just might feel good

i wanna push you around, i will, i will
i wanna push you down, i will, i will
i wanna take you for granted, i wanna take you for granted
i will
 she said  i don't know why you ever would lie to me
like i'm a little untrusting when i think that the truth is
gonna hurt ya
and i don't know why you couldn't just stay with me
you couldn't stand to be near me
when my face don't seem to want to shine
'cause it's a little bit dirty, well
don't just stand there, say nice things to me
'cause i've been cheated i've been wronged, and you
you don't know me, well i can't change
i won't do anything at all

i wanna push you around, i will, i will
i wanna push you down, i will, i will
i wanna take you for granted, i wanna take you for granted
i will
oh but don't bowl me over
just wait a minute well it kinda fell apart, things get so
crazy, crazy
don't rush this baby, don't rush this baby

i wanna push you around, i will, i will
i wanna push you down, i will, i will
i wanna take you for granted, i wanna take you for granted
i will

i'm in love with the world through the eyes of a girl
who's still around the morning after
we broke up a month ago and i grew up i didn't know
i'd be around the morning after
it's always been wait and see
a happy day and then you pay
and feel like shit the morning after
but now i feel changed around and instead of falling down
i'm standing up the morning after
situations get fucked up and turned around sooner or later
and i could be another fool or an exception to the rule
you tell me the morning after
crooked spin can't come to rest
i'm damaged bad at best
she'll decide what she wants
i'll probably be the last to know
no one says until it shows, see how it is
they want you or they don't
say yes
i'm in love with the world through the eyes of a girl
who's still around the morning after


well i sought gold and diamond rings
my own drug to ease the pain that living brings
walked from the mountain to the valley floor
searching for my beautiful reward
searching for my beautiful reward
from a house on a hill a sacred light shines
i walk through these rooms but none of them are mine
down empty hallways i went from door to door
searching for my beautiful reward
searching for my beautiful reward
well your hair shone in the sun
i was so high i was the lucky one
then i came crashing down like a drunk on a barroom floor
searching for my beautiful reward
searching for my beautiful reward
tonight i can feel the cold wind at my back
i'm flying high over gray fields my feathers long and black
down along the river's silent edge i soar
searching for my beautiful reward
searching for my beautiful reward
searching for my beautiful reward
searching for my beautiful reward

aboard a train, i met a dame
she was a hipster
man a real gone dame
she wasn't pretty
for new york city
as we strut down on that ol' fairlane
with a heave and a ho
well, i just couldn't let her go
get along
sweet little woman, get along
on your way, get along
sweet little woman, get along on your way
with a heave and a ho
well, i just couldn't let her go

the train kept a rollin' all night long
with a heave and a ho
i just couldn't let her go

i made a stop 'round albuquerque
she must'a thought, i was real gone jerk
got off the train at el paso
a' looking so good i couldn't let her go
get along
sweet little woman, get along



screams break the silence
waking from the dead of night
vengeance is boiling
he's returned to kill the light

then when he's found who he's looking for
listen in awe and you'll hear him

bark at the moon
ha ha ha ha ha

years spent in torment
buried in a nameless grave
now he has risen
miracles would have to save

those that the beast is looking for
listen in awe and you'll hear him

bark at the moon
hey yeah, bark at the moon

they cursed and buried him along with shame
and thought his timeless soul had gone, gone
in empty burning hell   unholy one
but he's returned to prove them wrong  so wrong 
ooh, yeah baby


howling in shadows
living in a lunar spell
he finds his heaven
spewing from the mouth of hell

those that the beast is looking for
listen in awe and you'll hear him

bark at the moon
hey yeah, bark at the moon
hey yeah, bark at the moon
oh oh yeah, bark at the moon



i wouldn't be angry if you'd just fucking cry
your tears would arouse me, refreshing my supply
the suffering is fading, i scream into the sky
repulsion invades me, i say goodbye

digging deep inside of me
getting past this agony
i can't seem to get away
another day rotting in vain

i wouldn't be angry if things would stay the same
you're fighting the torment that helps me feed my pain
the suffering is fading, i scream into the sky
repulsion invades me, i say goodbye

digging deep inside of me
getting past this agony
i can't seem to get away
another day rotting in...

i can't hear this  scat singing 
i can't fuck it  scat singing 
i can't take this  scat singing 
i hate  scat singing 

digging deep inside of me
getting past this agony
i can't seem to get away
another day rotting in...
digging deep inside of me
getting past this agony
i can't seem to get away
another day rotting in vain


i ain't never been with a woman long enough
for my boots to get old
we've been together so long now
they both need re soled
if i ever settle down
you'd be my kind
and it's a good time for me
to head on down the line

heard it in a love song
heard it in a love song
heard it in a love song
can't be wrong

i'm the kind of man who likes to get away
like to start dreaming about
tomorrow today
never said that i love you
even though it's so
where's that duffle bag of mine
it's time to go


i'm gonna be leavin'
at the break of dawn
wish you could come
but i don't need no woman taggin along
i'll sneak out that door
couldn't stand to see you cry
i'd stay another year if
i saw a teardrop in your eye


i never had a damn thing but what i had
i had to leave it behind
you're the hardest thing
i ever tried to get off my mind
always something greener
on the other side of that hill
i was born a wrangler and a rounder
and i guess i always will


i got green and i got blues
and every day there's a little less difference between the two
i belly up and disappear
well i ain't really drowning cause i see the beach from here
i could take a greyhound home but when i got there it'd be gone
along with everything a home is made up of
so i'll take two of what you're having and i'll take all of what you got
to kill this goddamn lonely, goddamn lonely love
sister, listen to what your daddy says
don't be ashamed of things that hide behind your dress
belly up and arch your back
well i ain't really falling asleep; i'm fading to black
you could come to me by plane, but that wouldn't be the same
as that old motel room in texarkana was
so i'll take two of what you're having and i'll take all of what you got
to kill this goddamn lonely, goddamn lonely love
stop me if you've heard this one before:
a man walks into a bar and leaves before his ashes hit the floor
stop me if i ever get that far
the sun's a desperate star that burns like every single one before
and i could find another dream
one that keeps me warm and clean
but i ain't dreamin' anymore, girl, i'm waking up
so i'll take two of what you're having and i'll take everything you got
to kill this goddamn lonely, goddamn lonely love
all i got is this goddamn lonely, goddamn lonely love
all i got is this goddamn lonely, goddamn lonely love
all i got is this goddamn lonely, goddamn lonely love


has our conscious shown?
has the sweet breeze blown?
has all kindness gone?
hope still lingers on
i drink myself of new found pity
sitting alone in new york city
and i don't know why

are we listening?
hymns of offering
have we eyes to see?
love is gathering
all the words that i've been reading
have now started the act of bleeding
into one
into one

so i walk up on high
and i step to the edge
to see my world below
and i laugh at myself
while the tears roll down
cause it's the world i know
it's the world i know
i drink myself of newfound pity
sitting alone in new york city
and i don't know why, don't know why

so i walk up on high
and i step to the edge
to see my world below
and i laugh at myself
while the tears roll down
'cause it's the world i know
oh it's the world i know
so i walk up on high
and i step to the edge
to see my world below
and i laugh at myself
while the tears roll down
'cause it's the world i know
oh it's the world i know


well, the mourning was complete
and there was tears on the steering wheel dripping on the seat
several hours or several weeks
i'd have the cheek to say they're equally as bleak

it's the beginning of the end
the car went up the hill and disappeared around the bend
ask anyone, they'll tell you that it's these times that it tends
to start to break in half, to start to fall apart, hold on to your heart

and do me a favour and break my nose
or do me a favour and tell me to go away
or do me a favour and stop asking questions

she walked away while her shoes were untied
and the eyes were all red, you could see that we'd cried
and i watched and i waited 'til she was inside
forcing a smile and waving goodbye
curiosity becomes a heavy load
too heavy to hold, too heavy to hold
curiosity becomes a heavy load
too heavy to hold, will force you to be cold

do me a favour and ask if you need some help
she said, "do me a favour and stop flattering yourself"
and to tear apart the ties that bind
perhaps "fuck off" might be too kind
perhaps "fuck off" might be too kind


just a small town girl
living in a lonely world
she took the midnight train
going anywhere

just a city boy
born and raised in south detroit
he took the midnight train
going anywhere

a singer in a smoky room
a smell of wine and cheap perfume
for a smile they can share the night
it goes on and on and on and on

strangers waiting
up and down the boulevard
their shadows searching in the night
streetlights, people
living just to find emotion
hiding somewhere in the night

working hard to get my fill
everybody wants a thrill
payin' anything to roll the dice
just one more time

some will win, some will lose
some were born to sing the blues
oh, the movie never ends
it goes on and on and on and on

strangers waiting
up and down the boulevard
their shadows searching in the night
streetlights, people
living just to find emotion
hiding somewhere in the night


don't stop believin'
hold on to that feeling
streetlights, people
ohohohhhhhhhhhh
don't stop believin'
hold on
streetlights, people
ohohohhhhhhhhhh
don't stop believin'
hold on to that feeling
streetlights, people
ohohohhhhhhhhhh


as you brush your shoes, stand before the mirror
and you comb your hair, grab your coat and hat
and you walk wet streets, tryin' to remember
all the wild night breezes in your mem'ry ever

and everything looks so complete
when you're walkin' out on the street
and the wind catches your feet
sends you flyin', cryin'
ooo woo wee, wild night is calling
ooo ooh wee, wild night is calling

all the girls walk by, dressed up for each other
and the boys do the boogie woogie on the corner of the street
and the people passin' by stare in wild wonder
and the inside jukebox roars out just like thunder

and everything looks so complete
when you're walkin' out on the street
and the wind catches your feet
sends you flyin', cryin'
ooo woo wee, wild night is calling
ooo ooh wee, wild night is calling
the wild night is calling
the wild night is calling

come on out and dance
whoa, come on out and make romance
come on out and dance
come on out, make romance

the last time i saw richard was detroit in '68
and he told me, "all romantics meet the same fate someday
cynical and drunk and boring someone in some dark caf 
"you laugh," he said, "you think you're immune
go look at your eyes, they're full of moon
you like roses and kisses and pretty men to tell you
all those pretty lies, pretty lies
when you gonna realise they're only pretty lies?
only pretty lies, just pretty lies"
he put a quarter in the wurlitzer, and he pushed
three buttons and the thing began to whirr
and a bar maid came by in fishnet stockings and a bow tie
and she said "drink up now, it's gettin' on time to close."
"richard, you haven't really changed," i said, it's just that
now you're romanticizing some pain that's in your head
you got tombs in your eyes, but the songs you punched are
dreaming, listen, they sing of love so sweet, love so sweet
when you gonna get yourself back on your feet?
oh and love can be so sweet, love so sweet
richard got married to a figure skater
and he bought her a dishwasher and a coffee percolator
and he drinks at home now most nights with the tv on
and all the house lights left up bright
i'm gonna blow this damn candle out
i don't want nobody comin' over to my table
i got nothing to talk to anybody about
all good dreamers pass this way some day
hidin' behind bottles in dark cafes
dark cafes, only a dark cocoon
before i get my gorgeous wings and fly away
only a phase, these dark cafe days

the story hit the news
from coast to coast
they said you beat the girl
you loved the most
your charitable acts
seemed out of place
with the beauty
with your fist marks on her face
your buddies all stood by
they bet their fortunes
and their fame
that she was out of line
and you were not to blame
six hundred thousand doctors
are putting on rubber gloves
and they're poking
at the miseries made of love
they say they're learning
how to spot
the battered wives
among all the women
they see bleeding through their lives
i bleed  
for your perversity  
these red words that make a stain
on your white washed claim that
she was out of line
and you were not to blame
i heard your baby say
when he was only three
"daddy, let's get some girls
one for you and one for me."
his mother had the frailty
you despise
and the looks
you love to drive to suicide
not one wet eye around
her lonely little grave
said, "he was out of line girl
you were not to blame."

comes a rain storm
put your rubbers on your feet
comes a snow storm
you can get a little heat
comes love
nothing can be done
comes a fire
firemen come and rescue me
blow a tire
you can patch the inner tube
comes love
nothing can be done
don't try hidin'
'cause it isn't any use
you'll just start slidin'
when your heart turns on the juice
comes a heat wave
you can hurry to the store
come a summons
hide yourself behind a door
comes love
nothing can be done
comes a headache
you can lose it in a day
comes a toothache
see your dentist right away
comes love
nothing can be done
comes the measles
you can quarrantine the room
comes a mousie
you can chase it with a broom
comes love
nothing can be done
that's all brother
if you've ever been in love
that's all brother
and you know just what i'm speakin' of
comes a nightmare
you can always stay awake
comes depression
you could get another break
comes love
nothing can be done
nothing can be done

the only one i know
has come to take me away
the only one i know
is mine when she stitches me
the only one i see
has found an aching in me
the only one i see
has turned her tongue into me
everyone has been burned before
everybody knows the pain
everyone has been burned before
everybody knows the pain
the only one i know
never cries, never opens her eyes
the only one i know
wide awake and then she's away
the only one i see
is mine when she walks down our street
the only one i see
has carved her way into me
everyone has been burned before
everybody knows the pain
everyone has been burned before
everybody knows the pain
everyone has been burned before
everybody knows the pain
everyone has been burned before
everybody knows the pain


rosemary
heaven restores you in life
you're coming with me
through the aging, the fearing, the strife
it's the smiling on the package
it's the faces in the sand
it's the thought that moves you upwards
embracing me with two hands
right will take you places
yeah, maybe to the beach
when your friends they do come crying
tell them now your pleasure's set upon slow release

hey, wait
great smile
sensitive to fate, not
denial
but hey, who's on trial?

it took a life span with no cell mate
the long way back
sandy, why can't we look the other way?

he speaks about travel
yeah, we think about the land
we smart like all peoples
feeling real tan
i could take you places
do you need a new man?
wipe the pollen from the faces
make revision to a dream while you wait in the van

hey, wait
great smile
sensitive to fate, not
denial
but hey, who's on trial?

it took a life span with no cell mate
by the long way back
sandy, why can't we look the other way?
you're weightless, you are exotic
you need something for which to care
sandy, why can't we look the other way?

leave some shards under the belly
lay some grease inside my hand
it's a sentimental jury
and the makings of a good plan
you've come to love me lightly
yeah, you come to hold me tight
is this motion ever lasting
or do shudders pass in the night?
rosemary
oh, heaven restores you in life

i spent a life span with no cell mate
the long way back
sandy, why can't we look the other way?
you're weightless, semi erotic
you need someone to take you there
sandy, why can't we look the other way?
why can't we just play the other game?
why can't we just look the other way?


all i need is a little time
to get behind this sun and cast my weight
all i need is a peace of this mind
then i can celebrate
all in all there's something to give
all in all there's something to do
all in all there's something to live
with you
all i need is a little sign
to get behind this sun and cast this weight of mine
all i need is the place to find
and there i'll celebrate
all in all there's something to give
all in all there's something to do
all in all there's something to live
with you


oh, kiss me
flick your cigarette, then kiss me
kiss me where your eye won't meet me
meet me where your mind won't kiss me
flick your eyes and mine and then hit me
hit me with your eyes so sweetly
oh, you know you know you know that yes i love
i mean i'd love to get to know you

do you never wonder?
no, no no no

you girls never know
oh no, you girls'll never know
no you girls never know
how you make a boy feel
you girls never know
oh no, you girls'll never know
no you girls never know
how you make a boy feel
how you make a boy




sometimes i say stupid things
that i think
well, i mean i
sometimes i think the stupidest things
because i never wonder
oh how the girl feels
oh how the girl feels
no you boys never care
oh no you boys'll never care
no you boys never care
how the girl feels
no you boys never care
you dirty boys'll never care
no you boys never care
how the girl feels

oh how the girl feels
oh how the girl feels


it's one and the same, one and the same, oh
so what's the use between death and glory?
i can't tell between death and glory?
happy endings, no, they'll never bored me
happy endings, they still don't bore me
but they, they have a way
a way to make you pay
and to make you toe the line

let's sever the ties
because i'm so clever
but clever ain't wise

and fuck forever
if you don't mind
oh, fuck forever
if you don't mind, don't mind, i don't mind, i don't mind

oh, what's the use between death and glory?
i can't tell between death and glory
new labour and tory
purgatory and no happy families
it's one and the same, one and the same
no, it's not the same, it's not supposed to be the same
you know about that way
the way they make you pay
and the way they make you toe the line

i severed my ties
oh, i'm so clever
you're so clever but you're not very nice

so fuck forever
if you don't mind
oh, i'm stuck forever
in your mind, your mind, your mind

go ahead and know about that way
to make you feel like shit and make you pay
and to make you toe the line, line

i sever my tie
oh, and i'll never
sever the ties

and fuck forever
if you don't mind
see, i'm stuck forever
oh, i'm stuck in your mind, your mind, your mind, your mind

oh, they'll never play this on the radio
oh, they'll never play this on the radio


i see a mountain at my gates
i see it more and more each day
what i give, it takes away
whether i go or when i stay

i see a mountain at my gates
i see it more and more each day
i see a fire out by the lake
i'll drive my car without the brakes

i see a mountain in my way
it's looming larger by the day
i see a darkness in my fate
i'll drive my car without the brakes

oh, gimme some time
show me the foothold from which i can climb
yeah, when i feel low
you show me a signpost for where i should go

i see a mountain at my gates
i see it more and more each day
and my desire wears a dark dress
but each day, i see you less

oh, gimme some time
show me the foothold from which i can climb
yeah, when i feel low
you show me a signpost for where i should go

through lanes and stone rows
black granite, wind blows
fire lake and far flame
go now but come again
dark clouds gather 'round
will i run or stand my ground?

oh, when i come to climb
show me the mountain so far behind
yeah, it's farther away
its shadow gets smaller day after day

yeah, gimme my way
gimme my love
gimme my choice
you keep me coming around
gimme my fate
gimme my lungs
gimme my voice
you keep me coming around
gimme my lungs
gimme my, gimme my, gimme my, gimme my
gimme my, gimme my, gimme my, gimme my, gimme my way
gimme my fate
gimme my lungs
gimme my choice

you make the night, i always cross the line
tightened our belts, abuse ourselves
get in our way, we'll put you on your shelf
another day, some other way
we're gonna go, but then we'll see you again
i've had enough, we've had enough
cold in vain, she said

i knew right from the beginning
that you would end up winnin'
i knew right from the start
you'd put an arrow through my heart

round and round
with love we'll find a way just give it time
round and round
what comes around goes around
i'll tell you why
... dig

lookin' at you, lookin' at me
the way you move, you know it's easy to see
the neon light's on me tonight
i've got a way, we're gonna prove it tonight
like romeo to juliet
time and time, i'm gonna make you mine
i've had enough, we've had enough
it's all the same, she said

i knew right from the beginning
that you would end up winnin'
i knew right from the start
you'd put an arrow through my heart

round and round
with love we'll find a way just give it time
round and round
what comes around goes around

out on the streets, that's where we'll meet
you make the night, i always cross the line
tightened our belts, abuse ourselves

round and round

wait   wait   i never had a chance to love you
now i only wanna say i love you one more time
wait   just a moment before our love will die
'cause i   must know the reason why we say goodbye
wait   just a moment and tell me why
cause i   can show you lovin' that you won't deny
wait   and show your lovin' like it was before
cause i   won't let that feelin' walk out through the door
i said wait   just a moment and try once more
'cause babe   i need to hold you like i did before
so if you go away   i know that i will follow
'cause there's a place inside my heart that tells me
hold out, hold out, hold out
oh, baby   wait   wait   i never had a chance to love you
wait   wait   if only our love could show you
wait   wait   i never wanna be without you
wait   wait   no i never had a chance to love you
now i only wanna say i love you one more time
solo
so if you go away   i know that i will follow
'cause there's a place inside my heart that tells me
hold out, hold out, hold out
oh, baby   wait   wait   i never had a chance to love you
wait   wait   if only our love could show you
wait   wait   i never wanna be without you
wait   wait   no i never had a chance to love you
now i only wanna say i love you...  wait... 
baby, i beg you to wait
no i never had a chance to love you

broken, bones and the will
capacity to disappear in misery saves
soaking, pain as a thrill, hate to instill
compassion's a cage
forgiving the father
read the story on my skin
i'll be the martyr
falling from his grace again
sunken, sooner or later
we crawl our way back into our favorite hole
drunken, swallow the savior
and follow him to hang from the highest pole
forgiving the father
read the story on my skin
tell me more about the man i should have been
i'll be the martyr
falling from his grace again
this is where the end begins


made a meal and threw it up on sunday
i've got a lot of things to learn
said i would and i'll be leaving one day
before my heart starts to burn

so what's the matter with you?
sing me something new
don't you know the cold and wind and rain don't know
they only seem to come and go away

times are hard when things have got no meaning
i've found a key upon the floor
maybe you and i will not believe in
the things we find behind the door

so what's the matter with you?
sing me something new
don't you know the cold and wind and rain don't know
they only seem to come and go away

stand by me, nobody knows the way it's gonna be
stand by me, nobody knows the way it's gonna be
stand by me, nobody knows the way it's gonna be
stand by me, nobody knows
yeah, nobody knows, the way it's gonna be

if you're leaving will you take me with you?
i'm tired of talking on my phone

summer has come and passed
the innocent can never last
wake me up when september ends
like my father's come to pass
seven years has gone so fast
wake me up when september ends

here comes the rain again
falling from the stars
drenched in my pain again
becoming who we are
as my memory rests
but never forgets what i lost
wake me up when september ends

hanging on the promises in songs of yesterday
an' i've made up my mind, i ain't wasting no more time
tho' i keep searching for an answer
i never seem to find what i'm looking for
oh lord, i pray you give me strength to carry on
'cos i know what it means
to walk along the lonely street of dreams
here i go again on my own
goin' down the only road i've ever known
like a drifter i was born to walk alone
an' i've made up my mind, i ain't wasting no more time
just another heart in need of rescue
waiting on love's sweet charity
an' i'm gonna hold on for the rest of my days
'cos i know what it means
to walk along the lonely street of dreams
here i go again on my own
goin' down the only road i've ever known
like a drifter i was born to walk alone
an' i've made up my mind, i ain't wasting no more time
but here i go again, here i go again
here i go again
oh baby

another night alone, a temporary dream
i came in through your window sleepwalking
standing arm and arm, still so out of reach
well, there's nowhere left to go
stay with me, stay with me

footsteps on the floor, your body's just a haze
in a rhythm of our own that's out of phase
feeling my body swoon to hear you say my name
i've got nowhere left to dream
so i'll just stay awake, stay awake

at last, i'm found
circle around
last dance, no sound
nowhere left to go, stay with me
nowhere left to go, stay with me

nowhere to go, nowhere to go
nowhere to go, nowhere to go
nowhere to go, nowhere to go
nowhere to go, nowhere to go  circle around 
nowhere to go, nowhere to go  circle around 
nowhere to go, nowhere to go  circle around 

at last, i'm found
circle around
last dance, no sound
nowhere left to go, stay with me
nowhere left to go, stay with me

nowhere left to go, stay with me
nowhere left to go, stay with me

touched down in the land of the delta blues
in the middle of the pouring rain
w.c. handy won't you look down over me
yeah i got a first class ticket
but i'm as blue as a boy can be

then i'm walking in memphis
walking with my feet ten feet off of beale
walking in memphis
but do i really feel the way i feel

saw the ghost of elvis
on union avenue
followed him up to the gates of graceland
then i watched him walk right through
now security they did not see him
they just hovered around his tomb
but there's a pretty little thing
waiting for the king
down in the jungle room

then i'm walking in memphis
walking with my feet ten feet off of beale
walking in memphis
but do i really feel the way i feel

they've got catfish on the table
they've got gospel in the air
and reverend green will be glad to see you
when you haven't got a prayer
but boy you've got a prayer in memphis

now muriel plays piano
every friday at the hollywood
and they brought me down to see her
and they asked me if i would
do a little number
and i sang with all my might
and she said
"tell me are you a christian child?"
and i said "ma'am i am tonight"

then i'm walking in memphis

there's no need for you to say you're sorry
goodbye, i'm going home
i don't care no more so don't you worry
goodbye, i'm going home

i hate the way that even though you know you're wrong
you say you're right
i hate the books you read and all your friends
your music's shite it keeps me up all night, up all night

there's no need for you to say you're sorry
goodbye, i'm going home
i don't care no more so don't you worry
goodbye, i'm going home

i hate the way that you are so sarcastic
and you're not very bright
you think that everything you've done's fantastic
your music's shite it keeps me up all night, up all night

and it will be nice to be alone
for a week or two
but i know that i will be right
right back here with you, with you
with you, with you, with you, with you, with you

there's no need for you to say you're sorry
goodbye, i'm going home
i don't care no more so don't you worry
goodbye, i'm going home


maybe i don't really wanna know
how your garden grows
'cause i just wanna fly
lately, did you ever feel the pain
in the morning rain
as it soaks you to the bone?

maybe i just wanna fly
wanna live, i don't wanna die
maybe i just wanna breathe
maybe i just don't believe
maybe you're the same as me
we see things they'll never see
you and i are gonna live forever

i said maybe i don't really wanna know
how your garden grows
'cause i just wanna fly
lately, did you ever feel the pain
in the morning rain
as it soaks you to the bone?

maybe i will never be
all the things that i wanna be
now is not the time to cry
now's the time to find out why
i think you're the same as me
we see things they'll never see
you and i are gonna live forever

i can't talk
my mind is so blank
so i'm going for a walk
i got nothing left to say
i can't see
there's a darkness on the rise
i'll be waiting here
till the end end of time

all my life been shaken
wanting something
holding everything i have like it was broken
gimme something good
gimme something good
gimme something
gimme something good
gimme something good
gimme something good
i was playing dead
i didn't make a sound
holding my breath
going underground
so i can't talk
i got nothing to say
it's like there's no tomorrow
barely yesterday

all my life been shaken
wanting something
holding everything i have like it was broken
gimme something good
gimme something good
gimme something
gimme something good
gimme something good
gimme something good
gimme something good
gimme something good oh no

all my life been shaken
wanting something
holding everybody back, demanding ransom
gimme something good
gimme something good
gimme something
gimme something good
gimme something good
gimme something good
gimme something good
gimme something good oh no


i lose a bit of myself with every selfie
lose sleep over wealth, it's not healthy
finding a new religion on yelp to come help me
praying to the label itself, "do not shelf me"
in the middle with the beggars and rejects
reading between text with weed, liquor, and sex
she say she love me at dusk, but at dawn
i pack up my things and i'm gone

and i don't know where i'm gonna go
but i don't care, i'm on the road
never been a perfect soul
but i will not apologize
been a lot of places in this life
and i did a lot wrong i can't make right
never been a perfect soul
but i will not apologize
said i will not apologize

i'm imperfect, i'm imperfect
no road map, getting lost on purpose
phone no service, but it's clear out here
i'm living with nothing to fear out here
there's lessons you learn
bridges you burn
all for the cost of a dollar to earn
and they say they love me at dusk, but at dawn
i pack up my things and i'm gone

and i don't know where i'm gonna go
but i don't care, i'm on the road
never been a perfect soul
but i will not apologize
been a lot of places in this life
and i did a lot wrong i can't make right
never been a perfect soul
but i will not apologize
said i will not apologize

but i will not apologize

i don't know where i'm gonna go
but i don't care, i'm on the road
never been a perfect soul
but i will not apologize
been a lot of places in this life
and i did a lot wrong i can't make right
never been a perfect soul
but i will not apologize

said i will not apologize
yeah, i will not apologize

pray for blood
pray for the cleansing
pray for the flood
pray for the end of this nightmare
this lie of a life can, as quickly as it came, dissolve
we seek only reprieve and welcome the darkness
the myth of a meaning so lost and forgotten  forgotten 
take hold of my hand
for you are no longer alone
walk with me in hell
pray for solace
pray for resolve
pray for a savior
pray for deliverance, some kind of purpose
a glimpse of a light in this void of existence
now witness the end of an age
hope dies in hands of believers
who seek the truth in the liar's eye
take hold of my hand
for you are no longer alone
walk with me in hell
walk with me in hell 
take hold of my hand
for you are no longer alone
walk with me in hell 
you're never alone 
walk with me in hell


do you know what's worth fighting for
when it's not worth dying for?
does it take your breath away
and you feel yourself suffocating?
does the pain weigh out the pride?
and you look for a place to hide?
did someone break your heart inside?
you're in ruins

one, twenty one guns
lay down your arms
give up the fight
one, twenty one guns
throw up your arms into the sky
you and i

when you're at the end of the road
and you lost all sense of control
and your thoughts have taken their toll
when your mind breaks the spirit of your soul
your faith walks on broken glass
and the hangover doesn't pass
nothing's ever built to last
you're in ruins

one, twenty one guns
lay down your arms
give up the fight
one, twenty one guns
throw up your arms into the sky
you and i

did you try to live on your own
when you burned down the house and home?
did you stand too close to the fire?
like a liar looking for forgiveness from a stone


when it's time to live and let die
and you can't get another try
something inside this heart has died
you're in ruins

one, twenty one guns
lay down your arms
give up the fight
one, twenty one guns
throw up your arms into the sky
one, twenty one guns
lay down your arms
give up the fight
one, twenty one guns
throw up your arms into the sky
you and i


if you take a step towards me, you will take my breath away
so i'll keep you close and keep my secret safe
no one else has ever loved me, no one else has ever tried
i never understood how much i could take
then i saw the worst was over when i laid my eyes on you
it was all that i could do to know my place
out of all the past illusions, out of all the dreams come true
i was gone until i finally saw your face

if you cried out for more
if you reached out for me
i would run into the storm
just to keep you here with me
i have gone beyond my years
i've wasted half my life
but i found it all in you
did i save you? 'cause i know you saved me too

let me take a step towards you, let me feel you in my hands
let me cross this line and show you where it leads
there's a darkness down inside me that i know we'll both enjoy
and it's screaming from within to set it free
i have left this bloody nightmare in my wake but out of sight
all i want is deviation by design
out of all the past confusion, out of all the common spite
just tell me i am yours 'cause you are mine

and if you cried out for more
if you reached out for me
i would run into the storm
just to keep you here with me
i have gone beyond my years
i've wasted half my life
but i found it all in you
did i save you? 'cause i know you saved me too

it doesn't really matter what you do or say
i'm never going anywhere anyway
'cause when i'm dying for you, i've never felt so alive

if you cried out for more
if you reached out for me
i would run into the storm
just to keep you here with me
i have gone beyond my years
i've wasted half my life
but i found it all in you
did i save you? 'cause i know you saved me too

i know you saved me too


stop making the eyes at me, i'll stop making the eyes at you
what it is that surprises me is that i don't really want you to

and your shoulders are frozen  cold as the night 
oh, but you're an explosion  you're dynamite 
your name isn't rio, but i don't care for sand
and lighting the fuse might result in a bang, b b bang oh

i bet that you look good on the dancefloor
i don't know if you're looking for romance or
i don't know what you're looking for
i said, i bet that you look good on the dancefloor
dancing to electro pop like a robot from 1984
well, from 1984

i wish you'd stop ignoring me because it's sending me to despair
without a sound, yeah, you're calling me and i don't think it's very fair

that your shoulders are frozen  cold as the night 
oh, but you're an explosion  you're dynamite 
your name isn't rio, but i don't care for sand
and lighting the fuse might result in a bang, b b bang oh

i bet that you look good on the dancefloor
i don't know if you're looking for romance or
i don't know what you're looking for
i said, i bet that you look good on the dancefloor
dancing to electro pop like a robot from 1984
well, from 1984

and no there in't no love, no montagues or capulets
just banging tunes and dj sets and
dirty dancefloors and dreams of naughtiness

well i bet that you look good on the dancefloor
i don't know if you're looking for romance or
i don't know what you're looking for
i said, i bet that you look good on the dancefloor
dancing to electro pop like a robot from 1984
said, from 1984


i turn my radio on for you, baby
at 2 am they will be playing your song
i turn my radio on for you, baby
i've been waiting all night long

ooh, ooh, ooh

i know you like to do me wrong
but your love is my favourite song

shut the bedroom window in the morning
go to the shop, make plans to be leaving
in the morning
thought i was sleeping it was just a dream
an alley cat chewing on dead meat
in the morning

out of the dark and into the light
when the morning comes i will be alright

when i leave i try not to wake her
tea and a toast to yesterday's capers
in the morning
she wrote my name on the red telephone box
when i got there she'd already rubbed it off
in the morning

out of the dark and into the light
when the morning comes i will be alright

and all this time i've watched it change
but it's still the same

in the morning
in the morning
in the morning
in the morning


your cruel device
your blood, like ice
one look, could kill
my pain, your thrill

i want to love you but i better not touch  don't touch 
i want to hold you but my senses tell me to stop
i want to kiss you but i want it too much  too much 
i want to taste you but your lips are venomous poison
you're poison running through my veins
you're poison
i don't want to break these chains
poison

your mouth, so hot
your web, i'm caught
your skin, so wet
black lace, on sweat

i hear you calling and it's needles and pins  and pins 
i want to hurt you just to hear you screaming my name
don't want to touch you but you're under my skin  deep in 
i want to kiss you but your lips are venomous poison
you're poison running through my veins
you're poison
i don't want to break these chains
poison

one look, could kill
my pain, your thrill
 2x 
i want to love you but i better not touch  don't touch 
i want to hold you but my senses tell me to stop
i want to kiss you but i want it too much  too much 
i want to taste you but your lips are venomous poison
you're poison running through my veins
you're poison
i don't want to break these chains
poison
i want to love you but i better not touch  don't touch 
i want to hold you but my senses tell me to stop
i want to kiss you but i want it too much  too much 
i want to taste you but your lips are venomous poison
 sampling 
i don't want to break these chains
poison
runnin' deep inside my veins
burnin' deep inside my brain
poison
i don't want to break these chains
poison


up on melancholy hill, there's a plastic tree
are you here with me?
just looking out on the day of another dream
where you can't get what you want, but you can get me
so let's set out to sea  love 
'cause you are my medicine when you're close to me
when you're close to me

so call in the submarines, 'round the world we'll go
does anybody know her
if we're looking out on the day of another dream?
if you can't get what you want, then come with me
up on melancholy hill sits the manatee
just looking out for the day
when you're close to me
when you're close to me
when you're close to me


move 

can't stop thinking about if and when i die
for now i see that "if" and "when" are truly different cries
for "if" is purely panic and "when" is solemn sorrow
and one invades today while the other spies tomorrow
we're surrounded and we're hounded
there's no above, or under, or around it
for "above" is blind belief and "under" is sword to sleeve
and "around" is scientific miracle, let's pick "above" and see
for if and when we go above, the question still remains
are we still in love and is it possible we feel the same?
and that's when goin' under starts to take my wonder
but until that time, i'll try to sing this

if i keep moving, they won't know
i'll morph to someone else
what they throw at me's too slow
i'll morph to someone else
i'm just a ghost
i'll morph to someone else
a defense mechanism mode

he'll always try to stop me, that nicolas bourbaki
he's got no friends close but those who know him most know
he goes by nico, he told me i'm a copy
when i'd hear him mock me, that's almost stopped me
well, we're surrounded and we're hounded
there's no above or a secret door
what are we here for
if not to run straight through all our tormentors?
but until that time, i'll try to sing this

if i keep moving, they won't know
i'll morph to someone else
what they throw at me's too slow
i'll morph to someone else
i'm just a ghost
i'll morph to someone else
a defense mechanism mode
i'll morph to someone else

lights, they blink to me, transmitting things to me
ones and zeroes, ergo this symphony
anybody listening? ones and zeroes
count to infinity, ones and zeroes
i'm surrounded and i'm hounded
there's no above, or under, or around it
for "above" is blind belief and "under" is sword to sleeve
and "around" is scientific miracle, let's pick "above" and see
for if and when we go above, the question still remains
are we still in love and is it possible we feel the same?
and that's when goin' under starts to take my wonder
but until that time
i'll morph to someone else
i'm just a ghost

if i keep moving, they won't know
i'll morph to someone else
what they throw at me's too slow
i'll morph to someone else
i'm just a ghost
i'll morph to someone else
a defense mechanism mode
if i keep moving, they won't know
i'll morph to someone else
a defense mechanism mode
i'll morph to someone else

not done, not done
not done, josh dun
i'll morph to someone else

i awoke today and found the frost
perched on the town
it hovered in a frozen sky, then it
gobbled summer down
when the sun turns traitor cold and all
the trees are shivering in a naked row
i get the urge for going
but i never seem to go
i get the urge for going
when the meadow grass is turning brown
summertime is falling down and winter
is closing in
i had me a man in summertime
he had summer colored skin
and not another girl in town
my darling's heart could win
but when the leaves fell on the ground
bully winds came around, pushed them face
down in the snow
he got the urge for going
and i had to let him go
he got the urge for going
when the meadow grass was turning brown
summertime was falling down and winter
was closing in
now the warriors of winter they gave a
cold triumphant shout
and all that stays is dying and all that
lives is camping out
see the geese in chevron flight flapping
and racing on before the snow
they got the urge for going
and they got the wings so they can go
they get the urge for going
when the meadow grass is turning brown
summertime is falling down and winter
is closing in
apply the fire with kindling now
i'll pull the blankets up to my chin
i"ll lock the vagrant winter out and
i'll fold my wandering in
i'd like to call back summertime
have her stay for just another
month or so
but she's got the urge for gong
so i guess she'll have to go
she gets the urge for going
when the meadow grass is turning brown
all her empire's falling down
and winter's closing in
and i get the urge for going
when the meadow grass is turning brown
and summertime is falling down

at last, my love has come along
my lonely days are over, and life is like a song
at last,the skies above are blue
my heart was wrapped in clover
the night i looked at you
i found a dream that i could speak to
a dream that i could call my own
i found a thrill to press my cheek to
a thrill i'd never known
you smiled, and then the spell was cast
and here we are in heaven, for you are mine at last
i found a dream that i could speak to
a dream that i could call my own
i found a thrill to press my cheek to
a thrill that i had never known
you smiled, and then the spell was cast
and here we are in heaven
for you are mine at last


i know how to hurt, i know how to heal
i know what to show and what to conceal
i know when to talk and i know when to touch
no one ever died from wanting too much

the world is not enough
but it is such a perfect place to start, my love
and if you're strong enough
together we can take the world apart, my love

people like us know how to survive
there's no point in living if you can't feel alive
we know when to kiss and we know when to kill
if we can't have it all, then nobody will

the world is not enough
but it is such a perfect place to start, my love
and if you're strong enough
together we can take the world apart, my love

i feel safe
i feel scared
i feel ready
and yet unprepared

the world is not enough
but it is such a perfect place to start, my love
and if you're strong enough
together we can take the world apart, my love

the world is not enough
the world is not enough
no, nowhere near enough
the world is not enough

the sleepless nights
the daily fights
the quick toboggan when you reach the heights
i miss the kisses and i miss the bites
i wish i were in love again
the broken dates
the endless waits
the lovely loving and the hateful hates
the conversations with the flying plates
i wish i were in love again
no more pain
no no more strain
now i'm sane
but i'd rather be punch drunk
the flying fur of cat and cur
the fine mismatching of a him and her
i've learned my lesson but
i wish i were in love again
the furtive sigh
the blackened eye
the words i love you 'til the day i die
the self deception that believes that lie
i wish i were in love again
when love congeals
it soon reveals
the faint aroma of performing seals
the double crossing of a pair of heels
i wish i were in love again
no more care
no more despair
now i'm all there
but i'd rather be punch drunk
believe me sir, i much prefer
the classic battle of a him and her
i don't like quiet and i wish i were
in love again
in love again


pull the blindfold down
so your eyes can't see
now run as fast as you can
through this field of trees

say goodbye to everyone
you have ever known
you are not gonna see them
ever again

i can't shake this feeling i've got
my dirty hands say i've been in the wars
the saddest thing that i'd ever seen
were smokers outside the hospital doors

someone turn me around
can i start this again?

how can we wear our smiles
with our mouths wide shut
cause you stopped us from singing?

i can't shake this feeling i've got
my dirty hands say i've been in the wars
the saddest thing that i'd ever seen
were smokers outside the hospital doors

someone turn me around
can i start this again?
now someone turn us around
can i start this again?
someone turn me around
can i start this again?
now someone turn us around
can i start this again?

we've all been changed from what we were
our broken hearts left smashed on the floor
i can't believe you if i can't hear you
i can't believe you if i can't hear you
we've all been changed from what we were
our broken hearts smashed on the floor
we've all been changed from what we were
our broken hearts smashed on the floor

someone turn me around
can i start this again?
now someone turn us around
can i start this again?

i got a girl named bony moronie
she's as skinny as a stick of macaroni
ought to see her rock and roll with her blue jeans on
not very fat, just skin and bone
i love her and she loves me
oh how happy now we can be
making love underneath the apple tree
she's my one and only, she's my heart's desire
she's a real upsetter, she's a real live wire
everybody turn when my baby walk by
she's something to see, she really catches the eye
i love her, she loves me
oh how happy now we can be
making love underneath the apple tree
told my mama and a papa too
just exactly what i wanna do
wanna get married on a night in june
and boogie by the light of a silvery moon
i love her, she loves me
oh how happy now we can be
makin' love underneath the apple tree
yeah, check this out
she's my one and only, she's my heart's desire
a real upsetter, she's a real live wire
everybody turn when my baby walk by
she something to see, she really catches the eye
i love her, she loves me
oh how happy now we can be
getting' it on underneath the apple tree
whooo, all right

when you can't find the light
that guides you through a cloudy day
when the stars ain't shinin' bright
and you feel like you've lost you're way
when those candle lights of home
burn so very far away
well you got to let your soul shine
just like my daddy used to say
he used to say soul shine
it's better than sunshine
it's better than moonshine
damn sure better than rain
hey now people don't mind
we all feel this way sometimes
got to let your soul shine
shine 'till the break of day
i grew up thinkin' that i had it made
gonna make it on my own
life can take the strongest man
make him feel so alone
now and then i feel a cold wind
blowin' through my achin' bones
i think back to what my daddy said
he said "boy, in the darkness before the dawn"
let your soul shine
it's better than sunshine
it's better than moonshine
damn sure better than rain
hey now people don't mind
we all get this way sometimes
gotta let your soul shine
shine 'till the break of day
sometimes a man can feel this emptiness
like a woman has robbed him of his very soul
a woman too, god knows, she can feel like this
and when your world seems cold
you got to let your spirit take control
talkinbout soul shine
it's better than sunshine
it's better than moonshine
damn sure better than rain
lord now people don't mind
we all feel this way sometimes
gotta let your soul shine
shine till the break of day
i said it's better than sunshine
it's better than moonshine
damn sure better than rain
yeah now people don't mind
we all get this way sometimes
gotta let your soul shine
shine 'till the break of day

won't you let me walk you home from school?
won't you let me meet you at the pool?
maybe friday i can
get tickets for the dance
and i'll take you, ooh hoo
won't you tell your dad, get off my back?
tell him what we said 'bout "paint it black"
rock and roll is here to stay
well, come inside where it's okay
and i'll shake you, ooh hoo
won't you tell me what you're thinking of?
would you be an outlaw for my love?
if it's so, well let me know
if it's no, well i can go
i won't make you, mm hmm


if you, if you could return
don't let it burn
don't let it fade
i'm sure i might be rude
but it's just your attitude
it's tearing me apart
it's ruining every day
and i swore, i swore i would be true
and honey, so did you
so why were you holding her hand?
is that the way we stand?
were you lying all the time?
was it just a game to you?

but i'm in so deep
you know i'm such a fool for you
you've got me wrapped around your finger
do you have to let it linger?
do you have to, do you have to, do you have to let it linger?

oh, i thought the world of you
i thought nothing could go wrong
but i was wrong, i was wrong
if you, if you could get by
trying not to lie
things wouldn't be so confused
and i wouldn't feel so used
but you always really knew
i just want to be with you

and i'm in so deep
you know i'm such a fool for you
you've got me wrapped around your finger
do you have to let it linger?
do you have to, do you have to, do you have to let it linger?
and i'm in so deep
you know i'm such a fool for you
you've got me wrapped around your finger
do you have to let it linger?
do you have to, do you have to, do you have to let it linger?
you know i'm such a fool for you
you've got me wrapped around your finger
do you have to let it linger?
do you have to, do you have to, do you have to let it linger?

how sad are we?
and how sad have we been?
we'll let you know, we'll let you know
oh, but only if you're really interested
you wonder how
we've stayed alive 'til now
we'll let you know, we'll let you know
but only if you're really interested
we're all smiles
then, honest, i swear, it's the turnstiles
that make us hostile
ohuoh, ohuoh, ohuoh, ohuoh, ohuoh
we will descend
on anyone unable to defend
themselves
ohuoh, ohuoh, ohuoh, ohuoh, ohu 
and the songs we sing
they're not supposed to mean a thing
la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

you're lonely, oh ... you're lonely
oh ...
get off the roof 
oh ... your arsenal 

we may seem cold, or
we may even be
the most depressing people you've ever known
at heart, what's left, we sadly know
that we are the last truly british people you'll ever know
we are the last truly british people you will ever know
you'll never never want to know


this song doesn't end when it's over
this song doesn't end when it's over

oh no, it goes on in your mind
oh, i sing, and it stings you
and now, my work is done

do  you recall when i was in love with you?
do you recall the lengths i would go to?
i must've been out of my mind

this song doesn't end just because it's over
no, it goes on in your head, in your hospital bed
you'll hear me instead of drip, drip, drip

oh, it goes on in your mind
i sing, it stings you
and now, my work is done

do  you recall when i was in love with you?
do you recall the lengths i would go to?

oh no, it goes on in your mind
i sing, and it stings you
and now, my work is done

do  you recall when i was in love with you?
do you recall the lengths i would go to?
no mountain too high, there were miles of smiles
no repulsive expense could ever not make sense
it's great to be out of your mind


i'm a troubled man
changed by the things i do
true, but it's funny how
they all remember you
it all could be different
time to do something new
giving everything
oh, to be a happy man too
gotta understand
blamed by the friends i lose
who's getting out of hand?
do you think they depend on you?
it all could be different
try to do something new
giving everything
oh, to be a happy man too

buy yourself a dream
how's it looking?
buy yourself a car
and a house to live in
get yourself a girl
someone different
buy yourself a dream
and it won't mean nothing

gonna run it 'round
strange but it just won't do
know when it's coming down
taking a hold on you
it all could be different
try to do something new
giving everything
oh, to be a happy man too

buy yourself a dream
how's it looking?
buy yourself a car
and a house to live in
get yourself a girl

how's it looking?
buy yourself a car
and a house to live in

 everybody's full of 
sugar, honey, ice, and tea
sugar, honey, ice, and tea

no, we can't have a struggle
but the "situation is in control"
so play pretend that it's all good
you could tell the messiah
his pants are on fire
i politely decline, i
i gotta go, i gotta stick my head in the sand
and block out all the sadness
la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

'cause it's got my head running 24 7
i don't know if i can figure it out
it's all messed up, only one thing i know for sure

and we all march on like we know the way to heaven
who the hell died and made you the king?
we don't know what we want, but we know that we want it
yeah, we want it, yeah, we want it right now

well it's floodin' down in texas
all of the telephone lines are down
and i've been tryin' to call my baby
lord, and i can't get a single sound

well dark clouds are rollin' in
man i'm standin' out in the rain

well, i'm leavin' you baby
lord, and i'm goin' back home to stay
well back home there's no floods or tornados
baby, and the sun shines every day


i was saying 'let me out of here' before
i was even born, it's such a gamble when you get a face
it's fascinating to observe what the mirror does, but
when i dine it's for the wall that i set a place

i belong to the blank generation, and
i can take it or leave it each time
i belong to the _____ generation, but
i can take it or leave it each time

triangles were falling out the window as the doctor cursed
he was a cartoon, long forsaken by the public eye
the nurse adjusted her garters as i breathed my first
the doctor grabbed my throat and yelled 'god's consolation prize '

to hold the t.v. to my lips, the air so packed with cash
then carry it up flights of stairs and drop it in the vacant lot
to lose my train of thought and fall into your arms' tracks
and watch beneath the eyelids every passing dot



resolve, i don't envy your seats
at least don't break, until we descend
to peace talks, full of remorse
but the keeper tends to remain aloof

they know what we'll lose
they know what they'll lose
such unspeakable ruin
now then, what will we do?

liaisons, falling in tow
this blinding forest, will bloody unfold
don't be long, this has to be told
we weave our mazes, be in debt to the earth

they know what we'll lose
they know what they'll lose
such unspeakable ruin
now then, what will we do?

but with gratitude and fortitude
we credit your enlightenment
the panic of his solitude is calling out

jessie is a friend
yeah, i know, he's been a good friend of mine
but lately something's changed that ain't hard to define
jessie's got himself a girl, and i wanna make her mine

and she's watching him with those eyes
and she's lovin' him with that body
i just know it
and he's holding her in his arms late, late at night

you know i wish that i had jessie's girl
i wish that i had jessie's girl
where can i find a woman like that?

i'll play along with this charade
that doesn't seem to be a reason to change
you know i feel so dirty when they start talking cute
i wanna tell her that i love her, but the point is probably moot

cause she's watching him with those eyes
and she's lovin' him with that body
i just know it
and he's holding her in his arms late, late at night

you know i wish that i had jessie's girl
i wish that i had jessie's girl
where can i find a woman like that?
like jessie's girl
i wish that i had jessie's girl
where can i find a woman...
where can i find a woman like that?

and i'm lookin' in the mirror all the time
wonderin' what she don't see in me
i've been funny; i've been cool with the lines
ain't that the way love's supposed to be?

tell me where can i find a woman like that?
you know i wish that i had jessie's girl
i wish that i had jessie's girl
i want jessie's girl
where can i find a woman like that?
like jessie's girl
i wish that i had jessie's girl
i want, i want jessie's girl

part 1: the death of st. jimmy

my heart is beating from me
i am standing all alone
please call me only if you are coming home
waste another year flies by
waste a night or two
you taught me how to live

in the streets of shame
where you've lost your dreams in the rain
there's no signs of hope
the stems and seeds of the last of the dope
there's a glow of light
the st. jimmy is the spark in the night
bearing gifts and trust
the fixture in the city of lust
what the hell's your name?
what's your pleasure and what is your pain?
do you dream too much?
do you think what you need is a crutch?

in the crowd of pain
st. jimmy comes without any shame
he says  we're fucked up, but we're not the same
and mom and dad are the ones you can blame"
jimmy died, today
he blew his brains out into the bay
in the state of mind
it's my own private suicide
part 2: east 12th st

well nobody cares, well nobody cares
does anyone care if nobody cares?
well nobody cares, well nobody cares
does anyone care if nobody cares?

jesus filling out paperwork, now
at the facility on east 12th st
he's not listening to a word, now
he's in his own world and he's daydreaming
he'd rather be doing something else, now
like cigarettes and coffee with the underbelly
his life's on the line with anxiety, now
and she had enough and he had plenty

somebody get me out of here
anybody get me out of here
somebody get me out of here
get me the fuck right out of here

so far away, i don't want to stay
get me out of here, right now
i just wanna be free, is there a possibility?
get me out of here, right now
this life like dream ain't for me
part 3: nobody likes you

i fell asleep while watching spike tv
after ten cups of coffee, and you're still not here
dreaming of a song, but something went wrong
and you can't tell anyone, 'cause no one's here
left me here alone when i should have stayed home
after ten cups of coffee, i'm thinking  where'd you go? 

nobody likes you, everyone left you  where'd you go? 
they're all out without you, havin' fun  where'd you go? 
everyone left you, nobody likes you  where'd you go? 
they're all out without you, havin' fun
 where'd you go... go... go... go... 
part 4: rock and roll girlfriend

geez... ha...

i got a rock and roll band, i got a rock and roll life
i got a rock and roll girlfriend and another ex wife
i got a rock and roll house, i got a rock and roll car
i play the shit out the drums, and i can play the guitar
i got a kid in new york, i got a kid in the bay
i haven't drank or smoked nothing in over 22 days
 don't want to be an american idiot 
so, get off my case, off of my case
off of my case 
part 5: we're coming home again

here they come, marching down the street
like a desperation murmur of a heart beat
coming back from the edge of town
underneath their feet
the time has come and it's going nowhere
nobody ever said that life was fair, now
go carts and guns are treasures they will bear
in the summer heat

the world is spinning 'round
and 'round, out of control again
from the 7 11
to the fear of breaking down
so send my love a letterbomb
and visit me in hell
we're the ones going

home, we're coming home again
home, we're coming home again

i started fuckin' running
just as soon as my feet touch ground
we're back in the barrio
but to you and me, that's jingle town, that's...

home, we're coming home again
home, we're coming home again
home, we're coming home again
home, we're coming home again
home, we're coming home again
home, we're coming home again
home, we're coming home again
home, we're coming home again
home, we're coming home again
 no  fuck off  just go  i don t care  i don t  i don t know  i smashed my phone  just go  i don t care  i don t  i don t know  i smashed my phone  

nobody likes you, everyone left you
they're all out without you, havin' fun


over and over again
i relive the moment
i'm bearing the burden within
open wounds hidden under my skin
pain as real as a cut that bleeds
the face i see every time i try to sleep
is staring at me crying

i'm running from the enemy inside
looking for the life i left behind
these suffocating memories
are etched upon my mind
and i can't escape from the enemy inside

i sever myself from the world
and shut down completely
all alone in my own living hell
overcome with irrational fear
under the weight of the world on my chest
i buckle and break as i try to catch my breath
tell me i'm not dying

i'm running from the enemy inside
looking for the life i left behind
these suffocating memories
are etched upon my mind
and i can't escape from the enemy inside

i'm a burden, i'm a travesty
i'm a prisoner of regret
between the flashbacks and the violent dreams
i am hanging on the edge
disaster lurks around the bend
paradise came to an end
and no magic pill
can bring it back again


i'm running from the enemy inside
looking for the life i left behind
these suffocating memories
are etched upon my mind
and i can't escape from the enemy inside


one, take control of me?
you're messing with the enemy
said it's two, it's another trick
messing with my mind, i wake up
chase down an empty street
blindly snap the broken beats
said it's gone, with the dirty trick
it's taken all these days to find ya

i tell you, i want you
i tell you, i need you

friends, take control of me
stalking cross the gallery
all these pills got to operate
the colour quits and all invade us
there it goes again
take me to the edge again
all i got, is a dirty trick
i'm chasing down all walls to save ya

i tell you, i want you
i'll tell you, i need you
the blood ain't on my face
just wanted you near me

i tell you, i want you
i'll tell you, i need you
the blood ain't on my hands
just wanted you near me


a thousand heads cut clean across their necks
right down the hall from me
the reich's relentless blade, thirsty and shining red
still echoes of their screams

this is a tarnished heirloom
passed down through iron fists
a shameful house of doom, a legacy of collapse
built on a painful truth

a thousand years of failure
a thousand years they bled
to the bear, the blitzkrieg, and the holy father
they just bowed their heads

they meekly did their time
counting the days
while harnessed to their rusty shackles
forever occupied, folded the crimson star
the rabbits turned to jackals
 still echoes of their screams 
still echoes of their screams

this is a tarnished heirloom
passed down through iron fists
a shameful house of doom, a legacy of collapse
built on a painful truth

a thousand years of failure
a thousand years they bled
to the bear, the blitzkrieg, and the holy father
they just bowed their heads

soviet hangover, eastern bloc
and dirty money still flows through locks
a killing ground of rebels, black marketeers
restrained, but there's no resistance here
south east asia in a euro cell block
saigon's children conceal what they've got
the opium trail runs west through here
they're selling disease to erase all your fears
 still echoes of their screams 
still echoes of their screams

a thousand years of failure
a thousand years they bled
to the bear, the blitzkrieg, and the holy father
they just bowed their heads
i won't bow my head
 still echoes of their screams 
i won't bow my head

i don't wanna be
i don't wanna be me
i don't wanna be
me anymore, more
men are throwing at his home
two glass houses, twenty stones
fourteen yellow, six are blue
could it be worse? quite doubtful...
i don't wanna be
i don't wanna be me
i don't wanna be
me anymore
i don't wanna be
i don't wanna be me
i don't wanna be
me anymore

one, two, three, four...
two steps forward, three steps back
without warning, heart attack
he fell asleep in the snow
never woke up, died alone
i don't wanna be
i don't wanna be me
i don't wanna be
me anymore
i don't wanna be
i don't wanna be me
i don't wanna be
me anymore
one, two...
one, two, three, four...
please don't dress in black
when you're at his wake
don't go there to mourn
but to celebrate
please don't dress in black
when you're at his wake
don't go there to mourn
but to celebrate
i don't wanna be

i don't wanna be
me anymore
i don't wanna be

one, two, three, four...
i don't wanna be  i don't wanna be

me anymore
i don't wanna be  i don't wanna be 
i don't wanna be me  wanna be me 
i don't wanna be  i don't wanna be 
me anymore

time, time, time
see what's become of me
time, time, time
see what's become of me
while i looked around for my possibilities
i was so hard to please
look around
leaves are brown
and the sky is a hazy shade of winter
hear the salvation army band
down by the riverside
it's bound to be a better ride than what you've got planned
carry a cup in your hand
look around
leaves are brown
and the sky is a hazy shade of winter
hang onto your hopes, my friend
that's an easy thing to say, but if your hopes should pass away
simply pretend
that you can build them again
look around
grass is high
fields are ripe
it's the springtime of my life
seasons change with the scenery
weaving time in a tapestry
won't you stop and remember me?
look around
leaves are brown
and the sky is a hazy shade of winter
look around
leaves are brown
there's a patch of snow on the ground
look around
leaves are brown
there's a patch of snow on the ground
look around
leaves are brown
there's a patch of snow on the ground


run and tell all of the angels
this could take all night
think i need a devil to help me get things right
hook me up a new revolution
cause this one is a lie
we sat around laughing and watched the last one die

now i'm looking to the sky to save me
looking for a sign of life
looking for something to help me burn out bright
i'm looking for a complication
looking cause i'm tired of lying
make my way back home when i learn to fly high

i think i'm done nursing the patience
it can wait one night
i'd give it all away if you give me one last try
we'll live happily ever trapped if you just save my life
run and tell the angels that everything's alright

now i'm looking to the sky to save me
looking for a sign of life
looking for something to help me burn out bright
i'm looking for a complication
looking cause i'm tired of trying

make my way back home when i learn to...

fly along with me, i can't quite make it alone
try to make this life my own
fly along with me, i can't quite make it alone
try to make this life my own

it's all kicking off again
words buzz but certainly don t sink in
the rain hits the tiles on the bathroom floor
hissing little rattlesnake
all fired up and ultimately afraid
so slam the door

cos baby when you talk like that
the pain moves from my chest to my lower back
are we trying to sell the ocean to the sea?
i thought we could communicate
perhaps do a few things the old fashioned way
are we trying to sell the ocean to the sea?

i'm praying for a soft exit
good neighbours who occasionally baby sit
then double cross behind the scenes
yes, okay, maybe, we're probably not
to end up, a no we go through quite a lot
it needs to stop

i punch my head, don t know what you want from me
it's a fucked up world so let's talk about it, please
they wanna make sketch shows about my anxiety dreams
are we trying to sell the ocean to the sea?


work me lord, work me lord
please don't you leave me
i feel so useless down here
with no one to love
though i've looked everywhere
and i can't find me anybody to love
to feel my care

so ah work me lord, whoa use me lord
don't you know how hard it is
trying to live all alone
every day i keep trying to move forward
but something is driving me, oh, back
honey, something's trying to hold on to me
to my way of life

so don't you forget me down here, lord
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
ah, ah, don't you forget me, lord
well, i don't think i'm any very special
kind of person down here, i know better

down in the gutter and looking for trouble
or something to that effect
and there she was, a metal cross ironically 'round her neck
and then she kissed me on the lips
and a fever came without a warning
said give me a holla
and then i will follow you down into the dark
and i was left in the depths surrounding her feral heart
oh, there's just something about the sun
that seems so very, very boring

what did you think when you made me this way?
what did you think when you left me this way?
hold me so close when we get to the gates
and we'll be together forever and ever and more

if you desire then you be my fire and i'll be your gasoline
i'm getting sick of all the kicks this city is selling me
and she said: "hey, let's get away
and i'll be your new religion, baby"

what did you think when you made me this way?
what did you think when you left me this way?
hold me so close when we get to the gates
and we'll be together forever and ever and more

oh, life is bigger
it's bigger than you and you are not me
the lengths that i will go to
the distance in your eyes
oh no, i've said too much
i set it up

that's me in the corner
that's me in the spotlight
losing my religion
trying to keep up with you
and i don't know if i can do it
oh no, i've said too much
i haven't said enough

i thought that i heard you laughing
i thought that i heard you sing
i think i thought i saw you try

every whisper of every waking hour
i'm choosing my confessions
trying to keep an eye on you
like a hurt lost and blinded fool, fool
oh no, i've said too much
i set it up

consider this, consider this
the hint of the century
consider this the slip
that brought me to my knees, failed
what if all these fantasies come flailing around?
now i've said too much

i thought that i heard you laughing
i thought that i heard you sing
i think i thought i saw you try

but that was just a dream
that was just a dream

that's me in the corner
that's me in the spotlight
losing my religion
trying to keep up with you
and i don't know if i can do it
oh no, i've said too much
i haven't said enough

i thought that i heard you laughing
i thought that i heard you sing
i think i thought i saw you try

but that was just a dream

that was just a dream, just a dream
just a dream, dream


oh, people get wild
i said, oh, the place is on fire
go 

just a step ahead of me
is a picture of my old life
i won't waste my energy
looking back in time
maybe what i'm gonna need
is to go out for tonight
put a hold on everything
and get to feelin' alright
alright

people gettin' wild
'cause the place is on fire
when nothing can control ya
that's when you know you're getting closer
here we go 

i was meant to be a king
the kind that leads a good life
but things ain't what they used to be
sometimes we need to compromise
i just need a place to go
where i can be with my friends
the kind of friends that run a show
and they always want to win
oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

people gettin' wild
'cause the place is on fire
when nothing can control ya
that's when you know you're getting closer

i am bent

i cannot stand how i feel inside
i can't be fixed and i can't be trusted
i'm not thinkin' of suicide
i'd rather take out the ones
that i know who have crossed me
i'm lookin' over the edge again
starin' into the face of destruction
this is always where faith begins
i've been in trouble before
and i always crushed it

i am bent
and i finally lost control
i can feel it deep inside my soul
now it's comin' on
all the way down

when i go, i go all the way
there's no fear and no one can stop me
i'm like a prison you can't escape
i'll make you wish you were callin' it quits 'cause you can't hang
all the things that i can't explain
make me feel like i'm caged and i'm crushed in
the chaos always starts the rage
now i feel so alone and i'm always insane

i am bent
and i finally lost control
i can feel it deep inside my soul
now it's comin' on
all the way down
i am bent
and i've got so far to go
if i ever wanna reach my goal
i better do it right now


steppin' under the sunlight
and let your problems drift away
i feel it on the inside
and i just take it day by day
i stay close to the outcome
and that's what makes me bulletproof

i'm comin' through
break all the rules
i'm comin' through
break all the rules
break all the rules
break all the rules

i am bent
and i finally lost control
i can feel it deep inside my soul
now it's comin' on
all the way down
i am bent
and i've got your heart of gold
if i ever wanna reach my goal
i better do it right now

alone away
lost, darkened rage
far from grace
a world betrayed
come and free the beast
can you hear me?
i want hope
behold, there's a way
a spark, a flame
won't you feed the needs
come and save me
i need you
i'll give you everything
i'll cure humanity
shelter, security
i'll make you part of me
prepare to feel nothing
the souls is dead
your savior bled
the soul is dead
bow down to machine messiah
give me your praise
i'll keep you safe
the soul is dead
bow down to machine messiah
the souls is dead
your savior bled
the soul is dead
bow down to machine messiah
give me your praise
i'll keep you safe
he soul is dead
bow down to machine messiah
i'll give you everything
i'll cure humanity
shelter, security
i'll make you part of me
i have returned


i'm cornered in fire so break out the secrets
i hope you know that you were worth it all along
i'm tired, you're angry, and everyone looks blurry
i love you. i'm leaving; so long

hey, little one
i'm so scared of what this could have been
i know that today i lost my only friend
my little one

the places i took you, they seem so fucking empty
i have trouble going anywhere at all
especially my own bedroom
and it stays awake to haunt me
so i'll pass out, black out, drunk in another bathroom stall

hey, little one
i'm so scared of what this could have been
i know that today i lost my only friend
how long must i justify my pain through these songs?
how long? how long?

hey, little one
i'm so scared of what this could have been
i know that today i lost my only little one
 my little one 
i'm so scared of what this could have been
i know that today i lost my only friend
how long must i talk about my pain in these songs?
how long? how long?

it's raining, it's sunny
it doesn't make a difference
i don't care about anything at all
it's raining, it's sunny
it doesn't make a difference
i don't care about anything at all


through the ages, all the weary and the blind
facing the unknown
off the venom
center our lives
knowing not your own is unwise
and i will return for more
the light will lead you ashore

paralyzed by
paralyzed by
paralyzed by thorn inside

to the angel
breathing on me from the right
a guilt you'll never know
from the devil
staring from the left hand side
souls to animal
recede your eyes
sulk in disgust
when there is doubt look to the obvious
and i'll decide what you will pay
changing your mind seals our fate

paralyzed by
paralyzed by
paralyzed by thorn inside
open your eyes
take a deep breath and return to life
wake up and fight
fight for the love and the burning light
open your eyes
take a deep breath and return to life
wake up and fight
fight for the love and the burning light


gather the bones and lay them in the sun
in patterns that capture the eye
no one could know, display for everyone
the holes in our souls we despise
timber and stone, monumental
remnants frozen in time
carried alone the burden
knowing it was all we could do to survive

only embers remain
refusing to fade
there's still light to find our way
only embers remain
black turning to gray
there's still light to find our way
only embers remain

scatter the dust, what we once held
in hand seems was never at all
gone in a gust, not ours to understand
an agony perpetual
holding my breath and close my eyes
for a second i can see you again
motionless, like that day
we lost who we both should have been

only embers remain
refusing to fade
there's still light to find our way
only embers remain
black turning to gray
there's still light to find our way
only embers...

i've been staring at her lying still for so long
 she's so still, she's so still 
waiting for this endless night to color into dawn
 it's never ending, it's never ending 
but it's never lifting, it's always shifting
no one can breathe
it holds me under, and this drags down you
 it drags you down, it drags you down 
this breaks what was made one into two


tired and lost
no one to trust
who is there to give the push
all i have learned
straighten the curve
like a circle to return

the long embrace
the smell of dirt and roses
under the sun
no sign of breath or water
i fall asleep under blankets of stars

ice hit you cold
heat of surprise
bending mind can't realize
faith is in me
end i can see
tears are strong as ten thousand tongues

my sweet mirage
i bathe in sacred waters
i kiss the sky
floating in sultans daughters
memories of loved ones only passing me by
memories of loved ones are passing me by
 x2 
oceans of sand and rust
give way and yield my wake

they're waiting inside
they're waiting to wash your eyes out
their hands are alive
alive with a fervent anger
your feet have been tied and your tongue in your hand
death of a thousand ravens
you're down on your knees
you're blind as the ancient kingdom

relive the ages of the moon
reeling the water close to you

reverend, reverend
is this some conspiracy?
crucified for no sins
an image beneath me
what's within our plans for life
it all seems so unreal
i'm a man cut in half in this world
left in my misery
the reverend he turned to me
without a tear in his eyes
nothing new for him to see
i didn't ask him why
i will remember
the love our souls had sworn to make
now i watch the falling rain
all my mind can see
now is your  face 
well i guess you took my youth
and gave it all away
like the birth of a new found joy
this love would end in rage
and when she died
i couldn't cry
the pride within my soul
you left me incomplete
all alone as the memories now unfold
believe the word
i will unlock my door
and pass the cemetery gates
sometimes when i'm alone
i wonder aloud
if you're watching over me
some place far abound
i must reverse my life
i can't live in the past
then set my soul free
belong to me at last
through all those complex years
i thought i was alone
i didn't care to look around
and make this world my own
and when she died
i should have cried
and spared myself some pain
you left me incomplete
all alone as the memories still remain
the way we were
the chance to save my soul
and my concern is now in vain
believe the word
i will unlock my door
and pass the cemetery gates

the way we were
the chance to save my soul
and my concern is now in vain
believe the word
i will unlock my door
and pass the cemetery
gates
gates
gates

the clouds will blow away
maybe i won't feel so afraid
i will try to understand
either way

maybe you still love me
maybe you don't
either you will or you won't
maybe you just need some time alone
i will try to understand
everything has its plan
either way
i'm going to stay
right for you

maybe the sun will shine today
the clouds will roll away
maybe i won't be so afraid
i will understand everything has its plan
either way


i had a dream last night, a vision, a prelude?
outside my body, i was free to do
all things under the sun, and everything i want
my head awake and clear, for everybody to hear
and like the brightest day
it fades away

revelation and progress
thorns to the weak
we are the eve of the ugly
the dawn of the new everything
here is love, here is sunrise
assassination of the old
here is peeling off corrosion
when the killing off the burdens that you have

we are the alpha, omega
the blessing, the curse
we're the order in chaos
execution and birth

in the midnight hour
when your soul's devoured
we go into the mass
though your heart is aching
and you feel forsaken
we go to black mass


i had a dream last night, and i wonder, was it true?
i saw a big machine, in a velvet castle room
inside the doom club, the spice, the cloak, and dagger
and the pentagram, i think i understand
more cyclones, more witches
inside the circle and the ring
in the ruins lies the future
another dimension, another fling

we are the alpha, omega
the blessing, the curse
we're the order in chaos
execution and birth
no, no, no

in the midnight hour
when your soul's devoured
we go into the mass
though your heart is aching
and you feel forsaken
we go to black mass
oh people, keep the light on
we bring a new sensation
enjoy the mass


twenty nine pearls in your kiss, a singing smile
coffee smell, and lilac skin, your flame in me
twenty nine pearls in your kiss, a singing smile
coffee smell, and lilac skin, your flame in me
i'm only here for this moment
i know everybody here wants you
i know everybody here thinks they need you
i'll be waiting right here just to show you
how our love will blow it all away
such a thing of wonder in this crowd

and our eyes are locked in downcast love
i sit here proud
even now you're undressed in your dreams with me
i'm only here for this moment
i know everybody here wants you
i know everybody here thinks he needs you
i'll be waiting right here just to show you

and all the tears we cried have dried on yesterday
a sea of fools have parted for us, there's nothing in our way, my love
don't you see? don't you see?
you're just the torch to put the flame to all our guilt and shame
and i'll rise like an ember in your name
no. no
i know everybody here wants you
i know everybody here thinks they need you
i'll be waiting right here just to show you

and i'll be waiting right by here just to show you

in shadows on the balcony
afraid to dive, it's worse to wait
the best ones cry

let me tell you about buddy joe
when he came down from mexico
with his pockets full of gold
have you something to declare
are you sure there's nothing there
'cos if there is, don't say
you've not been told
oh, buddy joe
what have they done with the gold
i don't really know
well buddy joe searched all his life
through mexico, all the riversides
not for the money, but for the gold
he needs to hold
well buddy joe, proud as he was
could not stand all the fuss
when they got to all his gold
he was ready to go
oh, buddy joe
what have they done with the gold
i don't really know
well you'll understand he didn't stand a chance
everybody was shouting commands
when buddy joe split in a hurry
soon he was ready to be burried
oh buddy joe
what have they done with the gold
i don't really know

tony   my head's on a pillow
clock strikes it's the count of four
four hours of tossin' turnin'
in a big brass bed
i've tried all the tricks in the book now
but i just can't sleep no more
tony, what's happenin' to me
i'm tired i'm cold
somehow i'm imagining things
movin' in the shadow
and my face is a painting crying
in the heat of the sun
let the world outside   pay it's dues
i'll never know why   no matter how high
it's a sign that's been sealed delivered
tony, it's lookin' into your
quiet eyes   silent tears
silent as the night you deserted me
quiet eyes   silent tears
silence   the night lasted seven years
meanwhile i'm counting all the hours
i've counted all the days
on the pages of a calendar
i threw it all away
tony i'm tryin' to make some sense baby
i'm always tryin' to get through to you
maybe you're the last one to notice
how much i've been lovin' you
let the world outside   pay it's dues
i'll never know why   no matter how high
it's a sign that's been sealed delivered
tony, it's lookin' into your
quiet eyes   silent tears
silent as the night you deserted me
quiet eyes   silent tears
silent as the night you deserted me
quiet eyes   silent tears
silence   the night lasted seven years
quiet eyes   silent tears
silent as the night you deserted me
quiet eyes   silent tears
silence   the night lasted seven years
quiet eyes   silent tears
silent as the night you deserted me
quiet eyes   silent tears
silence   the night lasted seven years


you have forsaken all the love you ve taken
sleeping on a razor, there s nowhere left to fall
your body s aching, every bone is breaking
nothing seems to shake it, it just keeps holding on
ah, ah, ah, ah
ah, ah, ah, ah
ah, ah, ah, ah
ah, ah, ah, ah

your soul is able, death is all you cradle
sleeping on the nails, there s nowhere left to fall
you have admired, every man desires
everyone is king when there s no one left to pawn
ah, ah, ah, ah
ah, ah, ah, ah
ah, ah, ah, ah
ah, ah, ah, ah


there is no peace here, war is never cheap, dear
love will never meet it, it just gets sold for parts
you cannot fight it, all the world denies it
open up your eyelids and let your demons run
ah, ah, ah, ah
ah, ah, ah, ah
ah, ah, ah, ah
ah, ah, ah, ah

she took my heart, left me for dead
and drank my blood, told me she said
our secret's worth, its weight in gold
that fire we had, now is turning cold

cut loose like an animal
fired out like a cannonball
but i waited too long
yeah i waited too long
got high from a holy vein
crashed down in a hurricane
love has been here and gone
love has been here and gone

where did you go? where did you run?
i can't erase what you've done
let's burn the past, forget the truth
you're still loving him, i'm still loving you

cut loose like an animal
fired out like a cannon ball
but i waited too long
yeah, i waited too long
got high from a holy vein
crashed down in a hurricane
love has been here and gone
love has been here and gone
cut loose like an animal

but i waited too long
yeah, i waited too long
got high from a holy vein
crashed down in a hurricane
love has been here and gone
love has been here and gone

but i waited too long for you, only
love has been here and gone, to die slowly
going under again, so don't follow me

look around me, you astound me
you are oh so beautiful, oh yeah i am home
been away far to long, thought of you with every song
every song i sang i sang for you
it's gonna take a little time
gonna take a little concentration
i think that time has come to state
when i said i couldn't get enough of that situation
well i recognize, i don't want to stay away
oh so beautiful, oh so beautiful
oh so beautiful, oh so beautiful
and through this crazy ride
you've been there deep inside
deep inside i know i'm not alone
and now it's all so clear
my doubts just disappear
when i'm with you i call it home
 chorus 
all my life
i've been waiting
and i think its right
don't go away
oh so beautiful, oh so beautiful
oh so beautiful, oh so beautiful
i've been around this great big world
must have loved a million girls
when i'm with you, i call it home


you killed the love that was once so strong
with no regret to what you did wrong
should i stay and fight?
can we make this right?
you looked through me like an open door
do i exist to you anymore?
 cause when i'm talking to you
there's someone else that you're hearing

i gave you all the love i had
and i almost gave you one more chance
then you put one in the chamber
and shot my heart of glass
this time will be the last

you played your game, used me like a pawn
check mate you're done and then you were gone
did i move too fast?
i thought we would last
now that you're through i can feel your soul
where there was love lies an empty hole
cause when i make love to you
it's someone else that you're feeling

i gave you all the love i had
and i almost gave you one more chance
then you put one in the chamber
and shot my heart of glass
this time will be the last
i gave you all the love i had
and i almost gave you one more chance
then you put one in the chamber
and shot my heart of glass
this time will be the last

so many nights
i've been standing at the wall
blindfolded with cigarette
waiting for the fall

i gave you all the love i had
and i almost gave you one more chance
then you put one in the chamber
and shot my heart of glass
this time will be the last
i gave you all the love i had
and i almost gave you one more chance
then you put one in the chamber
and shot my heart of glass
this time will be the last
i gave you all the love i had
and i almost gave you one more chance
then you put one in the chamber
and shot my heart of glass
this time will be the last


it's over
you don't need to tell me
i hope you're with someone who makes you
feel safe in your sleeping tonight

i won't kill myself, trying to stay in your life
i got no distance left to run

when you see me, please
turn your back and walk away
i don't want to see you
cause i know the dreams that you keep
is where we meet

when you're coming down, think of me here
i got no distance left to run

it's over
i knew it would end this way
i hope you're with someone who makes you feel
that this life, it's the life

and it settles down, stays around
spends more time with you
i got no distance left to run

i'm coming home
it's over
no more
over
no more, no more
no more

but we aren't feeling the same way
i ain't telling you a secret
i ain't telling you goodbye
it is the last thing on my mind
still you would not let things unwind
spinning tight around your head
can't you hear a word i said
i ain't telling you a secret
i ain't' telling you goodbye
when you call it is just not fair
it is the last thing you should share
i cannot deal; i will let you know still
i wish you did let it go
i ain't telling you a secret
i ain't telling you goodbye
i'm telling you for one last time
it is not just you; the problem is mine to hide
i waited as long as i could if you need it, sure
i would, that is fine


well, there is no going back to that
i am so numb cannot even react
did not say it is not ok
but we are not dealing the same way
i ain't telling you a secret
i ain't telling you goodbye
goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
i'm telling you for one last time
it is not just you; the problem is mine to hide
i waited as long as i could if you need it
sure i would, that is fine
i'm taking away a lot of stuff
i'm telling you it is rough but not goodbye



funny how i find myself in love with you
if i could buy my reasoning i'd pay to lose
one half won't do

i've asked myself, how much do you
commit yourself
it's my life, don't you forget
it's my life, it never ends  it never ends 

funny how i blind myself, i never knew
if i was sometimes played upon, afraid to lose

i'd tell myself, what good you do
convince myself
it's my life, don't you forget
it's my life, it never ends  it never ends 


i've asked myself, how much do you
commit yourself?
it's my life, don't you forget
caught in the crowd, it never ends

caught in the crowd, it never ends
it's my life, don't you forget
caught in the crowd, it never ends

i always thought that our relationship was good
you played the role of having sense, i always played the fool
now something's different, i don't know the reason why
whenever we separate i almost want to cry
oh no, please not that again
love rears up its ugly head
and when i come home late you don't complain or call
so as a consequence i don't go out at all
my friends are frightened, they don't know what's going on
they think you put a spell on me and now my mind is gone
oh no, please not that again
love rears up its ugly head
...its ugly head
love's not so bad they say
but you never know where love is gonna go

i'm standing at the altar
as they play the wedding march

i don't do business that don't make me smile
i love my aeroplane 'cause she's got style
i'm a treetop flyer
i will fly any cargo you can pay to run
these bush league pilots just can't get the job done
got to fly down into the canyons, never see the sun
there's no such thing as an easy run
for a treetop flyer
i'm flyin' low, i'm in high demand
fly fifteen feet off the rio grande
i'll blow the mesquite right up off the sand
seldom seen, especially when i land
i'm a treetop flyer
born survivor
people been asking me, "where'd you learn to fly that way?"
was over in vietnam, chasin' nva
the government taught me, and they taught me right
stay under the treeline, and you might be alright
i'm a treetop flyer
so i'm comin' home, i'm runnin' low and fast
i promised my woman this is gonna be my last
i get the ship down, i tie her fast
then some old boy walks up, says "hey son, you wanna make some fast cash?"
i'm a treetop flyer
well there's things i am, and there's things i'm not
i am a smuggler and i could get shot
ain't going to die, i ain't goin' to get caught
'cause i'm a flyin' fool and my aeroplane is just too hot
i'm a treetop flyer
born survivor
usually work alone


after your faith has let you down
i know you'll want to run around
and follow the crowd into the night
but after the disco
all of the shine just faded away
oh oh oh oh
do what you want, do what you will
don't tell me it's not our time

'cause i'm waiting here much too long and
don't assume that i need your love
the chill of night has got you dancing away, and i'm
not the dreamer or the dream you're out there looking for

how did i get in this winding maze of love
and there's something wrong
well it's sending you round and round
still we go nowhere

i see the ashes on the ground
another world is burning down
and under the cold and empty moon
but after the disco
all of the shine just faded away, ooh
do what you want, do what you will
but you can't hide, ooh
do what you want, do what you will
don't tell me it's not our time

'cause i'm waiting here much too long and
don't assume that i need your love
the chill of night has got you dancing away, and i'm
not the dreamer or the dream you're out there looking for

how did i get in this winding maze of love
and there's something wrong
well it's sending you round and round
still we go nowhere


i wouldn't be angry if you'd just fucking cry
your tears would arouse me, refreshing my supply
the suffering is fading, i scream into the sky
repulsion invades me, i say goodbye

digging deep inside of me
getting past this agony
i can't seem to get away
another day rotting in vain

i wouldn't be angry if things would stay the same
you're fighting the torment that helps me feed my pain
the suffering is fading, i scream into the sky
repulsion invades me, i say goodbye

digging deep inside of me
getting past this agony
i can't seem to get away
another day rotting in...

i can't hear this  scat singing 
i can't fuck it  scat singing 
i can't take this  scat singing 
i hate  scat singing 

digging deep inside of me
getting past this agony
i can't seem to get away
another day rotting in...
digging deep inside of me
getting past this agony
i can't seem to get away
another day rotting in vain


the movie ran through me
the glamour subdue me
the tabloid untie me
i'm empty please fill me
mister anchor assure me
that baghdad is burning
your voice it is so soothing
that cunning mantra of killing
i need you my witness
to dress this up so bloodless
to numb me and purge me now
of thoughts of blaming you
yes the car is our wheelchair
my witness your coughing
oily silence mocks the legless
now traveling in coffins
but on the corner  corner 
the jury's sleepless  sleepless 
we found your weakness  weakness

i didn't think it would take so long
before you took me away from
everything else, took me out of myself
i'm gone  gone 

we don't touch anymore
but we talk all the time so it's fine
can somebody tell me what i want?
'cause i keep changing my mind
i can see a progression
and i guess it's happening
a different direction
and i guess it's happening

shall we start again?

going over and over
growing older and older

sometimes i feel the fear of uncertainty stinging clear
and i, i can't help but ask myself
how much i let the fear take the wheel and steer

it's driven me before
and it seems to have a vague, haunting mass appeal
but lately i'm
beginning to find that i should be the one behind the wheel

whatever tomorrow brings i ll be there
with open arms and open eyes, yeah
whatever tomorrow brings i ll be there
i ll be there

so if i decide to waiver my chance
to be one of the hive
will i choose water over wine
and hold my own and drive?

it's driven me before
and it seems to be the way, that everyone else gets around
but lately i'm
beginning to find that when i drive myself, my light is found

whatever tomorrow brings i ll be there
with open arms and open eyes, yeah
whatever tomorrow brings i ll be there
i ll be there

would you choose water over wine?
hold the wheel and drive

whatever tomorrow brings i ll be there
with open arms and open eyes, yeah
whatever tomorrow brings i ll be there
i ll be there

we started living in an old house
my ma gave birth and we were checking it out
it was a baby boy, so we bought him a toy
it was a ray gun, and it was 1981

we named him 'baby', he had a toothache
he started crying, it sounded like an earthquake
it didn't last long, because i stopped it
i grabbed a rag doll and stuck some little pins in it

now we're a family, and we're alright now
we got money, and a little place to fight now
we don't know you, and we don't owe you
but if you see us around, i got something else to show you


now it's easy when you don't know better
you think it's sleazy? then put it in a short letter
we keep warm, but there's just something wrong with you
just feel that you're the hardest little button to button

i had opinions that didn't matter
i had a brain that felt like pancake batter
i got a backyard with nothing in it
except a stick, a dog, and a box with something in it

the hardest button to button
the hardest button to button
the hardest button to button
the hardest button to button
uh oh

they'll never forgive you but they won't let you go  oh no 
she'll never forgive you but she won't let you go, oh no 
don't look back into the sun
you've cast your pearls but you're on the run
and all the lies you said, who did you save?
but when they played that song at the death disco
it started fast but it ends so slow
and all the time just reminded me of you
they'll never forgive you but they won't let you go  let me go  
she'll never forgive you but she won't let you go, oh no 


i'm on my way
can't settle down
i'm stuck in ways of being an ass
and i got a lot of nerve that i'm ready to pass
i'm on my way
can't settle down
stuck in ways of sadistic joy
and my talent only goes as far as to annoy
i'm on my way

this is my main offender
this is what i've got and it got me saying
why me?

i'm on my way
i get around
but i'm not all too sure about what i do
i feel i've got to stop a second just to think it through
and so i stop 

i'm on my way
yeah i get around

and when i spit, i spit on those that i care less about
i'm on my way

i kept thinking i could never live
without you by my side
but then i spent so many nights
just thinking how you've done me wrong
i grew strong
i learned how to get along
and so you're back
from outer space
i just walked in to find you
here without that look upon your face
i should have changed my fucking lock
i would have made you leave your key
if i'd have known for just one second
you'd be back to bother me

oh now go

just not to fall apart
i'm trying hard to mend the pieces
of my broken heart
and i spent oh so many nights
just feeling sorry for myself
i used to cry
but now i hold my head up high
and you see me
with somebody new
i'm not that stupid little person
still in love with you
and so you thought you'd just drop by
and you expect me to be free
but now i'm saving all my lovin'
for someone who's lovin' me

oh now go

when i was a boy, i learned to play
far into the night and drift away
don't want to work on the milk or the bread
just want to play my guitar instead
when i was a boy, i had a dream
and radio waves kept me company
in those beautiful days when there was no money
when i was a boy, i had a dream
when i was a boy, i had a dream
finding out what life could really mean
don't want a job cause it drives me crazy
just wanna sing, "do you love me, baby?"
when i was a boy, i had a dream
and radio waves kept me company
in those beautiful days when there was no money
when i was a boy, i had a dream
when i was a boy


sharing secrets with another world
rubbing shoulders with some unknown lovers
making waves through the universe
starting wars with anonymous brothers

make a wish and i'll count to three
press the button and we'll both be happy
sending signals is a dirty trick
i get my love in a digital package

oscillate yourself tonight
when you're in your bed
simulate the dopamine
passing through your head

when you get back on a saturday night
and the room is caving in

do you look like me? do you feel like me?
do you turn into your effigy?
do you dance like this forever?

see yourself in cupid's lake
chipped in your head
do you indicate to satellites
passing by the edge?

when you get back on a saturday night
and your head is caving in

do you look like me? do you feel like me?
do you turn into your effigy?
do you dance like this forever?
do you dance like this forever?

do you look like me?
do you burn like me?

naturally the dying man wonders to himself:
has commentary been more lucid than anybody else?
and had he successfully beaten back the rising tide
of idiots, dilettantes, and fools
on his watch while he was alive
lord, just a little more time

oh, in no time at all
this'll be the distant past, ooh

so says the dying man once i'm in the box
just think of all the overrated hacks running amok
and all of the pretentious, ignorant voices that will go unchecked
the homophobes, hipsters, and one percent
the false feminists he'd managed to detect
oh, who will critique them once he's left?

oh, in no time at all
this'll be the distant past

what he'd give for one more day to rate and analyze
the world made in his image as of yet to realize
what a mess to leave behind

eventually the dying man takes his final breath
but first checks his news feed to see what he's 'bout to miss
and it occurs to him a little late in the game
we leave as clueless as we came
from rented heavens to the shadows in the cave
we'll all be wrong someday

oh, oh, oh


culture sucks down words
itemise loathing and feed yourself smiles
organise your safe tribal war
hurt maim kill and enslave the ghetto
each day living out a lie
life sold cheaply forever, ever, ever

under neon loneliness motorcycle emptiness
under neon loneliness motorcycle emptiness

life lies a slow suicide
orthodox dreams and symbolic myths
from feudal serf to spender
this wonderful world of purchase power
just like lungs sucking on air
survivals natural as sorrow, sorrow, sorrow

under neon loneliness motorcycle emptiness
under neon loneliness motorcycle emptiness

all we want from you are the kicks you ve given us
all we want from you are the kicks you ve given us
all we want from you are the kicks you ve given us
all we want from you are the kicks you ve given us

under neon loneliness motorcycle emptiness
under neon loneliness motorcycle emptiness

drive away and it's the same
everywhere death row, everyone's a victim
your joys are counterfeit
this happiness corrupt political shit
living life like a comatose
ego loaded and swallow, swallow, swallow

under neon loneliness motorcycle emptiness
under neon loneliness everlasting nothingness


the future teaches you to be alone
the present to be afraid and cold
so if i can shoot rabbits
then i can shoot fascists
bullets for your brain today
but we'll forget it all again
monuments put from pen to paper
turns me into a gutless wonder

and if you tolerate this
then your children will be next
and if you tolerate this
then your children will be next
will be next
will be next
will be next

gravity keeps my head down
or is it maybe shame
at being so young and being so vain
holes in your head today
but i'm a pacifist
i've walked la rambla
but not with real intent

and if you tolerate this
then your children will be next
and if you tolerate this
then your children will be next
will be next
will be next
will be next

and on the street tonight
an old man plays
with newspaper cuttings
of his glory days

and if you tolerate this
then your children will be next
and if you tolerate this
then your children will be next
will be next
will be next
will be next

is it my imagination
or have i finally found something worth living for?
i was looking for some action
but all i found was cigarettes and alcohol

you could wait for a lifetime
to spend your days in the sunshine
you might as well do the white line
'cause when it comes on top
you gotta make it happen
you gotta make it happen
you gotta make it happen
you gotta make it happen

is it worth the aggravation
to find yourself a job when there's nothing worth working for?
it's a crazy situation
but all i need are cigarettes and alcohol

you could wait for a lifetime
to spend your days in the sunshine
you might as well do the white line
'cause when it comes on top
you gotta make it happen 
you gotta make it happen 
you gotta make it happen 
you gotta make it happen 

you gotta, you gotta, you gotta make it
you gotta, you gotta, you gotta fake it
you gotta, you gotta, you gotta make it
you gotta, you gotta, you gotta fake it


i seem to think i think i got a little situation
so listen to me sister listen maybe you can help
i think i gave a lot of problems my consideration
but not for me, it always seem to be for someone else
why all the people always seem to just be on vacation
what do i get from it i don't get anything at all
i'm like a trash can holding all the information
and every single time it leaves me feeling two feet tall
salute your solution, now, salute your solution

i find myself just looking well beyond of my best intentions
ignoring any kinda applause i might receive at all
all others seem to find a road that's tough to satisfaction
i find a ridicule that isn't cool for me at all
and if there's one little answer to this complication
someone somewhere help me settle what is on my mind
there's only one i'm only taking getting and receiving
there's only one i'm taking
and only one i'm taking
and only one i'm taking
and only one i'm taking
and only one i'm taking
and only one

and i got what i got all despite you
and i get what i get just to spite you

i made it through another day
i feel the weight upon my shoulders now
the short goodbye

around the knife the deepest life smooth
until the truth defines my time
the warm skies
all, all my love is getting closer now
oooh
all, all my love is getting deeper know
is getting deeper know
oooh
take me out this mooted day
i'm gonna get my sou
to darker lights
i blink just once too many times
a place


contemplating, isolating
and it's stressing me out
different visions, contradictions
why won't you let me out?
i need a way to separate yeah
but i promise you that i'll make sure you never forget me
 never forget me 

now that you want it
now that you need it
i'm too far gone
you're trying to blame me
but i'm not breaking
i'm telling you, i'm bulletproof
believe me, i'm bulletproof
you make me so bulletproof
and now i'm too far gone

you're addicted and so twisted
that it's freaking me out
distant eyes, it's no surprise
you can't do anything now
i need a way to separate yeah
but i'm telling you that nothing will ever be the same

now that you want it
now that you need it
i'm too far gone
you're trying to blame me
but i'm not breaking
i'm telling you, i'm bulletproof
believe me, i'm bulletproof
you make me so bulletproof
and now i'm too far gone

 now that you want it

i'm too far gone
you're trying to blame me
but i'm not breaking
i'm telling you, i'm bulletproof
believe me, i'm bulletproof
you make me so bulletproof
and now i'm too far gone
i'm telling you, i'm bulletproof
believe me, i'm bulletproof
you make me so bulletproof
and now i'm too far gone


i'm a little alike
you before things had changed
inner compass aligned
all this feels rearranged

tell me, does it matter
if i'm still here, or i'm gone?
shifting to the after
an impostor, i'm not the one you know

i look the same outside
nearly me even though
i carry something i hide
underneath the one you know

tell me, does it matter
if i'm still here, or i'm gone?
shifting to the after
an impostor, soldiers on
are you surprised black water flows
from wells run dry?
i'm not the one you know


lay me out with flowered guilt
watch the explosions falling
cannot live within this tilt
carryin' over
i'm not the one you know

tell me, does it matter
if i'm still here, or i'm gone?
shifting to the after
an impostor, soldiers on
are you surprised black water flows
from wells run dry?
i'm not the one you know
i'm not the one you know


well how's your view of things today?
got up young to fade away
the sinners sin but aren't aware
our fables take us everywhere
i can't keep up with you
i can't keep up
i can't compete with history
we'll film it live but dub our tale
the mystery must stay inside
look at our homes, look at our lives
in control of the morning
in control of the sea

you are creating all the bubbles at night
i'm chasing round trying to pop them all the time
we don't need to trust a single word they say
you are creating all the bubbles at play

there's a girl, there's a girl
there's a girl, there's a girl
and she's down by the river
in her own creepy world
there's a girl, there's a girl
and she's down by the river
it's time to consider
that baby is a sinner
she'll wash away your sins  wash away your sins 
she'll wash away your sins  wash away your sins 
she'll wash away your sins and go home

i only once upset my kin
accused him of a moral slip
he came back and claimed a change
i know his life's the same again
i can't ask him again
i should let it go

you are creating all the bubbles at night
i'm chasing round trying to pop them all the time
we don't need to trust a single word they say

there's a girl, there's a girl
there's a girl, there's a girl
and she's down by the river

it's time to consider
that baby is a sinner
there's a girl, there's a girl
there's a girl, there's a girl
she'll wash away your sins
she's face down in the river


if i could reach the stars
pull one down for you
shine it on my heart
so you could see the truth
that this love i have inside
is everything it seems
but for now i find
it's only in my dreams

and i can change the world
i will be the sunlight in your universe
you would think my love was really something good
baby if i could change the world

if i could be king
even for a day
i'd take you as my queen
i'd have it no other way
and our love would rule
in this kingdom we have made
'til then i'd be a fool
wishing for the day

and i can change the world
i would be the sunlight in your universe
you would think my love was really something good
baby if i could change the world
baby if i could change the world

i could change the world
i would be the sunlight in your universe
you would think my love was really something good
baby if i could change the world
baby if i could change the world
baby if i could change the world


hero to zero
i pick up the bill
the brake lights cast a red light
and the road twists round the hill
lipstick on the backseat
saliva on the dash
i've clawed my way out of here before
but i keep on coming back

i push and you tend to shove
i give in and you don't give up
i'm not getting out of here this time
i brought a lemon to a knife fight
i kick and you like to punch
i'm unhinged and you're undone
i'm not getting out of here alive
i brought a lemon to a knife fight
i brought a lemon to a knife fight

hero to zero at 60mph
my eyes are getting wider with every word you say
intoxicated, higher than the iss
i've clawed my way out of here before
but tonight i'm turning left

i push and you tend to shove
i give in and you don't give up
i'm not getting out of here this time
i brought a lemon to a knife fight
i kick and you like to punch
i'm unhinged and you're undone
i'm not getting out of here alive

did you see the stylish kids in the riot?
shovelled up like muck and set the night on fire
wombles bleed, truncheons and shields
you know i cherish you my love

but there's a rumour spread nasty disease around town
you caught round the houses with your trousers down
a headrush in the bush

a year and a day

he knows it's eating, it's chewing me up
it's not right for young lungs to be coughing up blood
and it's all
it's all in my hands
and it's all up the walls

well the stale chips are up and the hope stakes are down
it's all these ignorant faces that bring this town down
and i sighed and sunken with pride
well i passed myself down on my knees
yes i passed myself down on my knees

now tell me what can you want now you've got it all
the whole scene is obscene
time will strip it away
a year and a day
and bill bones
bill bones knows what i mean

he knows there's fewer more distressing sights than that
of an englishman in a baseball cap
and we'll die in the class we were born
but that's a class of our own my love
a class of our own my love

did you see the stylish kids in the riot
shovelled up like muck
set the night on fire
wombles bleed truncheons and shields
you know i cherish you my love
yeah i cherish you my love

see a blackbird flying now, see it now... through my window
and so the rocket man came down to land
from the unknown
on the ground he never found the truth...
turned his eyes...
to the skies...
we were eternal back in those days
but now we are memories
they hide us away
but we were the only ones
never forget, those fallen heroes
never again...

i can't sleep tonight
everybody saying everything's alright
still i can't close my eyes
i'm seeing a tunnel at the end of all these lights
sunny days
where have you gone?
i get the strangest feeling you belong

why does it always rain on me?
is it because i lied when i was seventeen?
why does it always rain on me?
even when the sun is shining
i can't avoid the lightning

i can't stand myself
i'm being held up by an invisible man
still life on a shelf when
i got my mind on something else
sunny days
oh where have you gone?
i get the strangest feeling you belong

why does it always rain on me?
is it because i lied when i was seventeen?
why does it always rain on me?
even when the sun is shining
i can't avoid the lightning

oh, where did the blue skies go?
and why is it raining so?
it's so cold
i can't sleep tonight
everybody's saying everything's all right
still i can't close my eyes
i'm seeing a tunnel at the end of these lights
sunny days
oh, where have you gone?

lost in the wild
so come to me now

someone who'll kill on my command
and asks no questions

i'm gonna make you
i'm gonna break you
i'm gonna make you
a fucking psycho
a fucking psycho

maybe i'll meet a scientist in sweatpants and a hair tie
we'll conversate about rare birds and midi keyboards
and we'll slow dance, head on my shoulder
swayin' back and forth and
my friends look on and smile
everything's gonna be alright

jumping like a dog on prozac
and fishing with dynamite
i thought that i was in the green
but it turns red every time

you drive me crazier than a wingless bee
you drive me crazier than i ought to be
oh put your best dress on, better make it black
i'm going out but i'm not coming back

hit by a lightning bolt
now there's tire marks on the street
i think i quite like this tune
but couldn't you find a bigger beat

you drive me crazier than a wingless bee
you drive me crazier than i wanna be
put your best dress on, better make it black
i'm going out but i'm not coming back
i'm not coming back

i don't know where i fit anymore
i snapped the key when i tried to lock the door
the canyons are up in flame
and england's misspelt my name
i don't know where i fit anymore

you drive me crazier than a wingless bee
you drive me crazier than i wanna be

you might kill me with desire
wind me tighter than a wire
it's something that you do to me
i run away like mercury
and i know you think it's rough
when you're trying to patch us up
and i say honey what is love?
you just say i drink too much

maybe i'm defective
or maybe i'm dumb
i'm sorry, so sorry for what i've done
maybe i'm bad natured
or maybe i'm young
i'm sorry, so sorry for what i've done

and i'm the t shirt that i wear
pick the thorns out of my hair
i broke your heart so carelessly
i made the pieces part of me
and now it hurts what we've become
'cause you taught me how to love
it's me who taught you how to stop
and you just say i drink too much

maybe i'm defective
or maybe i'm dumb
i'm sorry, so sorry for what i've done
maybe i'm bad natured
or maybe i'm young
i'm sorry, so sorry for what i've done

home is where i want to be
pick me up and turn me around
i feel numb, born with a weak heart
but i guess i must be having fun
the less we say about it the better
make it up as we go along
feet on the ground, head in the sky
it's okay, i know nothing's wrong, nothing

oh  i got plenty of time
oh  you got light in your eyes
and you're standing here beside me
i love the passing of time
never for money, always for love
cover up and say goodnight, say goodnight

home, is where i want to be
but i guess i'm already there
i come home, she lifted up her wings
i guess that this must be the place
i can't tell one from the other
i find you, or you find me?
there was a time before we were born
if someone asks, this is where i'll be, where i'll be oh 

we drift in and out
oh  sing into my mouth
out of all those kinds of people
you got a face with a view
i'm just an animal looking for a home and
share the same space for a minute or two
and you love me till my heart stops
love me till i'm dead
eyes that light up
eyes look through you
cover up the blank spots
hit me on the head i got ooh

sleepless nights
losing ground, i'm reaching for you, you, you
feeling that it's gone can change your mind
if we can't go on to survive the tide, love divides

someday love will find you

how we touched and went our separate ways
if he ever hurts you, true love won't desert you
you know i still love you
though we touched and went our separate ways

troubled times
caught between confusion and pain, pain, pain   distant eyes
promises we made were in vain, in vain, in vain

your confusion
my illusion
worn like a mask of self hate
confronts and then dies
don't walk away

people like you find it easy
naked to see
walking on air
hunting by the rivers
through the streets
every corner abandoned too soon
set down with due care

don't walk away, in silence
don't walk away

on this harvest moon

when we were strangers
i watched you from afar
when we were lovers
i loved you with all my heart
but now it's getting late
and the moon is climbing high
i want to celebrate

just before our love got lost you said
"i am as constant as a northern star"
and i said, "constantly in the darkness
where's that at?
if you want me i'll be in the bar"
on the back of a cartoon coaster
in the blue tv screen light
i drew a map of canada
oh, canada
with your face sketched on it twice

oh, you are in my blood like holy wine
you taste so bitter and so sweet
oh, i could drink a case of you, darling
and i would still be on my feet
oh, i would still be on my feet

oh, i am a lonely painter
i live in a box of paints
i'm frightened by the devil
and i'm drawn to those ones that ain't afraid
i remember that time you told me, you said
"love is touching souls"
surely you touched mine
'cause part of you pours out of me
in these lines from time to time

oh, you are in my blood like holy wine
you taste so bitter and so sweet
oh, i could drink a case of you, darling
still i'd be on my feet
i would still be on my feet

i met a woman
she had a mouth like yours
she knew your life
she knew your devils and your deeds
and she said
"go to him, stay with him if you can
but be prepared to bleed"

oh, but you are in my blood, you are my holy wine
you're so bitter, bitter and so sweet
oh, i could drink a case of you, darling
still i'd be on my feet
i would still be on my feet

what on earth is wrong with you?
oh, milk cow

now, you've left you a calf
and your milk is turning blue
lord, your calf is hungry
and i believe he needs a suck
lord, your calf is hungry
i believe he needs a suck

if you see my milk cow, baby now
please drive her home
lord, my milk cow been rambling
for miles around
lord, my milk cow been rambling
for miles around
well, how can you suck on some other man's bull cow
in this strange man's town?


oh, where oh where can my baby be?
the lord took her away from me
she's gone to heaven, so i got to be good
so i can see my baby when i leave this world

we were out on a date in my daddy's car
we hadn't driven very far
there in the road, up straight ahead
a car was stalled, the engine was dead
i couldn't stop, so i swerved to the right
i'll never forget the sound that night
the screaming tires, the busting glass
the painful scream that i heard last

oh, where oh where can my baby be?
the lord took her away from me
she's gone to heaven, so i got to be good
so i can see my baby when i leave this world

when i woke up, the rain was pouring down
there were people standing all around
something warm running in my eyes
but somehow i found my baby that night
i lifted her head, she looked at me and said
"hold me darling just a little while."
i held her close, i kissed her our last kiss
i found the love that i knew i would miss
but now she's gone, even though i hold her tight
i lost my love, my life that night

oh, where oh where can my baby be?
the lord took her away from me
she's gone to heaven, so i got to be good
so i can see my baby when i leave this world



say hey 

hear the sound of the falling rain
coming down like an armageddon flame  hey  
the shame, the ones who died without a name
hear the dogs howling out of key
to a hymn called "faith and misery"  hey  
and bleed, the company lost the war today

i beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
this is the dawning of the rest of our lives
on holiday

hear the drum pounding out of time
another protester has crossed the line  hey  
to find the money's on the other side
can i get another amen?  amen  
there's a flag wrapped around a score of men  hey  
a gag, a plastic bag on a monument

i beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
this is the dawning of the rest of our lives
on holiday

"the representative from california has the floor"

sieg heil to the president gasman
bombs away is your punishment
pulverize the eiffel towers
who criticize your government
bang bang goes the broken glass
and kill all the fags that don't agree
trials by fire, setting fire
is not a way that's meant for me
just  cause, just  cause
because we're outlaws, yeah 

i beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
this is the dawning of the rest of our lives

i walk a lonely road
the only one that i have ever known
don't know where it goes
but it's home to me, and i walk alone
i walk this empty street
on the boulevard of broken dreams
where the city sleeps
and i'm the only one, and i walk alone
i walk alone, i walk alone
i walk alone, i walk a 

my shadow's the only one that walks beside me
my shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
sometimes i wish someone out there will find me
'til then i walk alone

i'm walking down the line
that divides me somewhere in my mind
on the borderline
of the edge and where i walk alone
read between the lines
what's fucked up, and everything's all right
check my vital signs
to know i'm still alive, and i walk alone
i walk alone, i walk alone
i walk alone, i walk a 

my shadow's the only one that walks beside me

there's a song playing on the radio
sky high in the airwaves on the morning show
and there's a lifeline slipping as the record plays
as i open the blinds in my mind, i'm believing that you could stay

and oh, if you stay
i'll chase the rain blown fields away
we'll shine like the morning and sin in the sun
oh, if you stay
we'll be the wild ones, running with the dogs today

there's a song playing through another wall
all we see and believe is the dj and debts dissolve
and it's a shame the plane is leaving on this sunny day
'cause on you, my tattoo will be bleeding and the name will stain

and oh, if you stay
we'll ride through disguised suburban graves
we'll go from the bungalows where the debts still grow each day
and oh, if you stay
i'll chase the rain blown fears away
we'll shine like the morning and sin in the sun
oh, if you stay
we'll be the wild ones, running with the dogs today
we'll be the wild ones, running with the dogs today

oh, if you stay
oh, if you stay
oh, if you stay
oh, if you stay
oh, if you stay
oh, if you stay
oh, if you stay
oh, if you stay
oh, if you stay


pearls and swine
bereft of me
long and weary
my road has been
i was lost in the cities
alone in the hills
no sorrow or pity
for leaving, i feel, yeah

i am not your rolling wheels
i am the highway
i am not your carpet ride
i am the sky

friends and liars

under my heels
and still too close

it was 1989, my thoughts were short my hair was long
caught somewhere between a boy and man
she was seventeen and she was far from in between
it was summertime in northern michigan
ahh ahh ahh
ahh ahh ahh

splashing through the sand bar
talking by the campfire
it's the simple things in life, like when and where
we didn't have no internet
but man, i never will forget
the way the moonlight shined upon her hair

and we were trying different things
we were smoking funny things
making love out by the lake to our favorite song
sipping whiskey out the bottle, not thinking 'bout tomorrow
singing sweet home alabama all summer long
singing sweet home alabama all summer long

catching wild life from the dock
watching the waves roll off the rocks
she'll forever hold a spot inside my soul
we'd blister in the sun
we couldn't wait for night to come
to hit that sand and play some rock and roll

while we were trying different things
we were smoking funny things
making love out by the lake to our favorite song
sipping whiskey out the bottle, not thinking 'bout tomorrow
singing sweet home alabama all summer long
singing sweet home alabama all summer long

now nothing seems as strange as when the leaves began to change
or how we thought those days would never end
sometimes i'll hear that song and i'll start to sing along
and think man i'd love to see that girl again

and we were trying different things
we were smoking funny things
making love out by the lake to our favorite song
sipping whiskey out the bottle, not thinking 'bout tomorrow
singing sweet home alabama all summer long
singing sweet home alabama all summer long
and we were trying different things
we were smoking funny things
making love out by the lake to our favorite song
sipping whiskey out the bottle, not thinking 'bout tomorrow
singing sweet home alabama all summer long
singing sweet home alabama all summer long

singing sweet home alabama all summer long
singing sweet home alabama all summer long
singing sweet home alabama all summer long
singing sweet home alabama all summer long

the wind rushing 'round my open heart
an open ravine with my spirit light
totally alive and my spirit light
through an open doorway
across a street to another life
and catching my reflection in a window
switching on a light, one i didn t know

from a thousand years of sleep

your menstruating heart

what an inheritance
the salt and the kleenex
morbid self attention
bending my pinky back
a little discipline
a donor by habit
a little discipline
rent an opinion

sense of security
holding blunt instrument
midlife crisis
i'm a perfectionist
and perfect is a skinned knee


freedom rider on a midnight cruise

i think i'm going parasailing
miles above, it s so serene
i'm letting go of all the troubles
that i've seen, that i ve seen
way up here, no one can touch me
i'm drifting like a lost balloon
i'm out of reach and won't be coming down
any time soon, any time soon

i'm high as a kite
don't you think they know what i'm worth?
flying like a beautiful bird
i'm high as a kite
don t you think they know what i m worth?
why i gotta come down to earth?

i feel no pain, i feel no pleasure
i only want to disappear
so let me play this game for children
and vanish into the atmosphere

i'm high as a kite
don t you think they know what i'm worth?
flying like a beautiful bird
i'm high as a kite
don't you think they know what i m worth?
why i gotta come down to earth?

when i'm high
and i'm giving up the nightmare chase, woah woah
and all i wanna do is blow my mind, woah woah
all i wanna do is blow my mind
i can fly up to the stratosphere
high above the cirrus clouds
where i am one with the universe

i'm high as a kite
don't you think they know what i'm worth?
flying like a beautiful bird
i'm high
don't you think they know what i'm worth?
why i gotta come down to earth when i'm high?

i ve been driving all night
my hand s wet on the wheel
there s a voice in my head that drives my heel
it s my baby calling
says "i need you here"
and it s half past four and i m shifting gear

when she s lonely and the longing gets too much
she sends a cable coming in from above
don t need no phone at all
we ve got a thing that s called radar love
we ve got a wave in the air
radar love

the radio s playing some forgotten song
brenda lee s "coming on strong"
the road has got me hypnotized
and i m speeding into a new sunrise

when i get lonely and i m sure i ve had enough
she sends her comfort coming in from above
don t need no letter at all
we ve got a thing that s called radar love
we ve got a line in the sky
radar love

no more speed i m almost there
gotta keep cool now gotta take care
last car to pass here i go
and the line of cars drove down real slow
and the radio played that forgotten song
brenda lee s "coming on strong"
and the newsman sang his same song
one more radar love is gone

when i get lonely and i m sure i ve had enough
she sends her comfort coming in from above
don t need no letter at all
we ve got a thing that s called radar love
we ve got a line in the sky
radar love

we ve got a thing that s called radar love
we ve got a thing that s called radar love

royal canadian blended
the spicy aroma had mended me
matured for years and imported
into my glass you poured it

and you're the only reason
that i remain unfrozen
suppose it stands to reason
that you would turn on me

you're so solid
you're so solid
it burns inside of me
cause you're so solid
it burns inside of me

you would keep the secrets in ya'
you've been keeping paraphernalia, oh
i think you know
anyone can walk up to ya'
anyone can see right through your eyes
all night

and i don't mean to be unkind
but i see what's in your mind
and the stone you throw
will turn back in its path
one day you'll shatter like a wall of glass
wall of glass
wall of glass
one day you'll shatter like a wall of glass

you believe in fascinations
and designer vaccinations, love
you get along
you were sold a one direction
i believe the resurrection's on
and you were wrong

and i don't mean to be unkind

i can't promise
you a lot
but you and me
and the road ahead
i can't change
you from yourself
you gotta want it
all that's left
is you and me
and the road ahead
wherever that wind might blow
wherever that river rolls
you know i will go with you
lookin' over
the mountain's crown
the water roars
and tumbles down
like you and me
and the road ahead
wherever that wind might blow

you know i will go with you
just you and me

walk in silence
don't walk away, in silence

see the danger
always danger
endless talking
life rebuilding
don't walk away

walk in silence
don't turn away, in silence

your confusion
my illusion
worn like a mask of self hate
confronts and then dies
don't walk away

people like you find it easy
naked to see
walking on air
hunting by the rivers
through the streets
every corner abandoned too soon
set down with due care

don't walk away, in silence
don't walk away

love of mine, some day you will die
but i'll be close behind
i'll follow you into the dark
no blinding light or tunnels to gates of white
just our hands clasped so tight
waiting for the hint of a spark
if heaven and hell decide
that they both are satisfied
illuminate the "no"'s on their vacancy signs
if there's no one beside you
when your soul embarks
then i'll follow you into the dark
in catholic school as vicious as roman rule
i got my knuckles bruised by a lady in black
and i held my tongue as she told me
"son, fear is the heart of love."
so i never went back
if heaven and hell decide
that they both are satisfied
illuminate the "no"'s on their vacancy signs
if there's no one beside you
when your soul embarks
then i'll follow you into the dark
you and me have seen everything to see
from bangkok to calgary
and the soles of your shoes are all worn down
the time for sleep is now
but it's nothing to cry about
'cause we'll hold each other soon
in the blackest of rooms
if heaven and hell decide
that they both are satisfied
illuminate the "no"'s on their vacancy signs
if there's no one beside you
when your soul embarks
then i'll follow you into the dark
then i'll follow you into the dark


heard you got detention three times this week
playing with the bad kids down by the creek
when i was your age, oh i, did the same
i'll save you some trouble, boy, and try to explain

it's early morning, the sun comes out
last night was shaking and pretty loud
my cat is purring, it scratches my skin
so what is wrong with another sin?
the bitch is hungry, she needs to tell
so give her inches and feed her well
more days to come, new places to go
i've got to leave, it's time for a show

here i am
rock you like a hurricane
here i am
rock you like a hurricane

my body is burning, it starts to shout
desire is coming, it breaks out loud
lust is in cages 'til storm breaks loose
just have to make it with someone i choose
the night is calling, i have to go
the wolf is hungry, he runs the show
he's licking his lips, he's ready to win
on the hunt tonight for love at first sting

here i am

under the arc of a weather stain boards
ancient goblins and warlords
come out of the ground, not making a sound
the smell of death is all around
and the night when the cold wind blows
no one cares, nobody knows

i don't want to be buried in a pet sematary
i don't want to live my life again
i don't want to be buried in a pet sematary
i don't want to live my life again

follow victor to the sacred place
this ain't a dream, i can't escape
molars and fangs, the clicking of bones
spirits moaning among the tombstones
and the night, when the moon is bright
someone cries, something ain't right

i don't want to be buried in a pet sematary
i don't want to live my life again
i don't want to be buried in a pet sematary
i don't want to live my life again

the moon is full, the air is still
all of a sudden i feel a chill
victor is grinning, flesh rotting away
skeletons dance, i curse this day
and the night when the wolves cry out
listen close and you can hear me shout

i don't want to be buried in a pet sematary
i don't want to live my life again
i don't want to be buried in a pet sematary
i don't want to live my life again

oh no, oh no
i don't want to live my life again, oh no, oh oh
i don't want to live my life again, oh no no no
i don't want to live my life again, oh oh


a thought burst in my head and i need to tell you
it's news that i forethought
was it just a dream that happened long ago?
i think i just forgot

well it hasn't been the first time
and it sure does drive me mad

there's a boy who fogs his world and now he's getting lazy
there's no motivation and frustration makes him crazy
he makes a plan to take a stand but always ends up sitting
someone help him up or he's gonna end up quitting

i shuffle through my mind
to see if i can find
the words i left behind
was it just a dream that happened long ago?
oh well...
never mind

well it hasn't been the first time
and it sure does drive me mad

there's a boy who fogs his world and now he's getting lazy
there's no motivation and frustration makes him crazy
he makes a plan to take a stand but always ends up sitting
someone help him up or he's gonna end up quitting

hero to zero
i pick up the bill
the brake lights cast a red light
and the road twists round the hill
lipstick on the backseat
saliva on the dash
i've clawed my way out of here before
but i keep on coming back

i push and you tend to shove
i give in and you don't give up
i'm not getting out of here this time
i brought a lemon to a knife fight
i kick and you like to punch
i'm unhinged and you're undone
i'm not getting out of here alive
i brought a lemon to a knife fight
i brought a lemon to a knife fight

hero to zero at 60mph
my eyes are getting wider with every word you say
intoxicated, higher than the iss
i've clawed my way out of here before
but tonight i'm turning left

i push and you tend to shove
i give in and you don't give up
i'm not getting out of here this time
i brought a lemon to a knife fight
i kick and you like to punch
i'm unhinged and you're undone

my body's an ark
i'm lost to the sea
i look to the stars
as the waves cover me
it's a beautiful night to behold
the most beautiful that i've ever known
ships in the rain
i'll see you again
ships in the rain
i'll see you again
their whistles are blowin'
they're looking for me
like an orchestra playin'
as i sink to the deep
but this cold, black ocean will know
that this sailor will never come home
ships in the rain
i'll see you again
ships in the rain
i'll see you again
ships in the rain
i'll see you again
ships in the rain
'til we meet again


i've got a lot of love and i've got a lot of ways to show it
but you should know by now that i'm broken and i need your help
i wrote a hundred songs to make sense of the meaningless
i'll un write them all if you help me clear up this mess

cause i would never break your heart
i would only re arrange
all the other working parts will stay in place
listen to me when i say, darling you're my everything
i didn't mean to hesitate, please stay with me

i've got a lot of rage and i'm struggling with ways to control it
when i wake in the morning i've forgotten what it is to cope
i scratch at my eyes and it renders me visionless
even in the dark, what i want isn't what i need

cause i would never break your heart
i would only rearrange
all the other working parts will stay in place
listen to me when i say, darling you're my everything
i didn't mean to hesitate, please stay with me

cause i would never break your heart

his dirty breath smells of beer

i am an old woman named after my mother
my old man is another child that's grown old
if dreams were lightning, thunder were desire
this old house would have burnt down a long time ago

make me an angel that flies from montgomery
make me a poster of an old rodeo
just give me one thing that i can hold on to
to believe in this living is just a hard way to go
when i was a young girl well, i had me a cowboy
he weren't much to look at, just free rambling man
but that was a long time and no matter how i try
the years just flow by like a broken down dam

make me an angel that flies from montgomery
make me a poster of an old rodeo
just give me one thing that i can hold on to
to believe in this living is just a hard way to go
there's flies in the kitchen. i can hear 'em, they're buzzing
and i ain't done nothing since i woke up today
how the hell can a person go to work in the morning
and come home in the evening and have nothing to say

make me an angel that flies from montgomery
make me a poster of an old rodeo
just give me one thing that i can hold on to
to believe in this living is just a hard way to go

and when the money comes in for the work i do

when i come home  when i come home , oh, i know i'm gonna be
i'm gonna be the man who comes back home to you
and if i grow old, well, i know i'm gonna be
i'm gonna be the man who's growin' old with you

but i would walk five hundred miles

when i'm lonely, well, i know i'm gonna be
i'm gonna be the man who's lonely without you
and when i'm dreamin', well, i know i'm gonna dream
i'm gonna dream about the time when i'm with you
when i go out  when i go out , well, i know i'm gonna be
i'm gonna be the man who goes along with you
and when i come home  when i come home , yes, i know i'm gonna be

doesn't matter what you do, girl
ooh girl, with you
no matter what you do
i will always be around
won't you tell me what you found, girl
ooh girl, want you
knock down the old grey wall

nothing to say, nothing to see, nothing to do
if you would give me all
as i would give it to you
nothing would be, nothing would be, nothing would be
no matter where you go
there will always be a place
can't you see it in my face, girl
ooh girl, want you

ooh girl, with you
ooh girl, you girl, want you
ooh girl, you girl, want you


just another microcosm somewhere in the ether
putting the world to rights with bing crosby eyes
oversharing and its bitter aftertaste
exactly the wrong time in exactly the wrong place
save it for a rainy day
baby, you go hard in the paint
it's just another race to anyways

philanthropic toga party
what a place for both the opposite sides of my double life to finally collide
sharing secrets i was taking to the grave
nosebleeds from epiphanies i took full in the face
oh, come all by the fire, babe, let s all participate
in yet another race to anyways
oh, how's your mum and dad been doing with the generation gap?

yeah, i'm behind my movie camera
i ve got my megaphone
you can call me alexander
it's nice to meet you all

listening to the shipping forecast
driving to the airport
me and the guys
metropolis ablaze in the rear view
devising methods to both have and eat your cake
mmm, just like the ones that mother nature used to bake
you look as if you know exactly what i'm gonna say
it's just another race to
anyways

we were born before the wind
also younger than the sun
ere the bonnie boat was won as we sailed into the mystic
hark, now hear the sailors cry
smell the sea and feel the sky
let your soul and spirit fly into the mystic
and when that foghorn blows i will be coming home
and when that foghorn blows i want to hear it
i don't have to fear it
i want to rock your gypsy soul
just like way back in the days of old
then magnificently we will float into the mystic
and when that foghorn blows you know i will be coming home
and when that foghorn whistle blows i got to hear it
i don't have to fear it
i want to rock your gypsy soul
just like way back in the days of old
and together we will float into the mystic
come on girl
too late to stop now

ey, yo, it's just another bombtrack  yeah 
it goes a 1, 2, 3
yeah, and it's just another bombtrack

and suckers be thinkin' that they can fake this
but, i'ma drop it at a higher level
'cause i'm inclined to stoop down, hand out some beat downs
could run a train on punk fools, that think they run the game
but i learned to burn that bridge, and delete
those who compete at a level that's obsolete
instead, i warm my hands upon the flames of the flag
to recall the downfall and the businesses that burnt us all
see through the news and the views, that twist reality
enough  i call the bluff, fuck manifest destiny
landlords and power whores on my people, they took turns
dispute the suits, i ignite, and then watch 'em burn

with the thoughts from a militant mind
hardline, hardline after hardline
landlords and power whores on my people, they took turns
dispute the suits, i ignite, and then watch 'em burn

burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn

started as a sketch in my notebook
and now dope hooks make punks take another look
my thoughts ya hear and ya begin to fear
that ya card will get pulled if ya interfere

with the thoughts from a militant, militant mind
hardline, hardline after hardline
landlords and power whores on my people, they took turns
dispute the suits, i ignite, and then watch 'em burn

long day lay me low
lay me low
head burning drunk
i don't need none
that's right man i'm fine
but what i've got to know
is have i wasted time?
my eyes are blind
to almost everything you see
and i'm drowning through sorrow
  you recognize me  
be me for a change  fucked 
under the silk
in a box of pine
and that's dying  
not a single other life
ever will have felt my price
is it worth the risk to be revived?
and i'm dying, i'm hollow
  it won't deny me  
be me for a change  fucked 
how long will i stay?
they'll take the pain away
on and outta my mind
gimme some medicine...
and i'm drowning through sorrow
  it won't deny me  
be me for a change  fucked 
yeah, one more time...
long day kill me long


the light in the window is a crack in the sky
a stairway to darkness in the blink of an eye
a levee of tears to learn she'll never be coming back
the man in the dark will bring another attack
your mama told you that you're not supposed to talk to strangers
look in the mirror tell me do you think your life's in danger here, yeah

no more tears 

another day passes as the night closes in
the red light goes on to say it's time to begin
i see the man around the corner waiting, can he see me?
i close my eyes and wait to hear the sound of someone screaming here

no more tears 


so now that it's over can't we just say good bye?
i'd like to move on and make the most of the night
maybe a kiss before i leave you this way
your lips are so cold, i don't know what else to say
i never wanted it to end this way, my love, my darling
believe me when i say to you in love i think i'm falling here

no more tears 


well, i've been watching, while you've been coughing
i've been drinking life, while you've been nauseous
and so i drink to health, while you kill yourself
and i've got just one thing that i can offer

go on and save yourself
and take it out on me
go on and save yourself
and take it out on me, yeah

i'm not a martyr, i'm not a prophet
and i won't preach to you, but here's a caution
you better understand, that i won't hold your hand
but if it helps you mend, then i won't stop it

go on and save yourself
and take it out on me
go on and save yourself
and take it out on me, yeah

go on and save yourself
and take it out on me
go on and save yourself
and take it out on me, yeah

drown if you want, and i'll see you at the bottom
where you'll crawl on my skin and put the blame on me
so you don't feel a thing

go on and save yourself
and take it out on me
go on and save yourself
and take it out on me, yeah

go on and save yourself
and take it out on me
go on and save yourself
and take it out on me, yeah


you've built this world around you, your universe
in spite of best intentions, things could not be worse
chaos and fear have left you hanging by a thread
as you argue with the voice inside your head

untethered angel
falling to darkness
don't be afraid of letting go
giving up yourself will set you free

misgiving and dismay, nightmares and wasted days
can't live your life this way, something needs to change
cold feet and second thoughts; entangled, tied in knots
avoidance at all costs, a painful thing to watch

fear can live inside you
push you to the edge
face the fear within you
wake up from the dead

untethered angel
falling to darkness
don't be afraid of letting go
giving up yourself will set you free
set you free

untethered angel
falling to darkness
don't be afraid of letting go
open your heart, be set free



written on the water, memories dissipate
eyes begin to open, darkness drifts away
time and space, like roses whose petals drop and fade
and fall into the light as if dreams of yesterday

too much love is not enough for us
i was once too blind to see

there is nothing sacred, only heaven knows
so turn towards the sun and look into your soul

too much love is not enough for us
i was once too blind to see
too much hope will never be enough
it's become so clear to me


too much love is not enough for us
i was once too blind to see
too much hope will never be enough
the truth is clear to me


ah, ah
 oh 
ah, ah

i think it's time you take another look around if you're gonna bring a knife into a gunfight bragging how you're sick of hearing every single human being seeing as they're watching but can't see past what they're seeing
you can keep em at bat but put that knife away
always with the wild card you're gonna wanna play cuz you're my implosionatic
my implosion addict
that a boy
don't rock the boat
that a boy

i think it's time you take another couple days off
gotta make a conversation such a face off
i'm betting debt is threatening to make it worse
try to hide you're dreaming up an epitaphic verse
you can keep em at bay but put your pills away
always with the wild card you always wanna play
so much for dying before you're 30 or 27 like jan and jim

her eyes filled as she loaded the weapon
her mind races, she cries

just like the white winged dove
sings a song
sounds like she's singin'
whoo whoo whoo
just like the white winged dove
sings a song
sounds like she's singin'
whoo, baby, whoo
said, whoo

and the days go by
like a strand in the wind
in the web that is my own
i begin again
said to my friend, baby  everything stops 
nothin' else mattered
he was no more
 he was no more 
than a baby then
well, he seemed broken hearted
somethin' within him
but the moment
that i first laid
eyes on him
all alone on the edge of seventeen

just like the white winged dove
sings a song
sounds like she's singin'
whoo, baby, whoo, whoo
just like the white winged dove
sings a song
sounds like she's singin'
said, whoo, baby, whoo
said, whoo

well, i went today
maybe i will go again
tomorrow, yeah, yeah
well, the music there
well it was hauntingly familiar
when i see you doin'
what i try to do for me
with their words of a poet
and a voice from a choir
and a melody
nothin' else mattered

just like the white winged dove
sings a song
sounds like she's singin'
whoo, baby, whoo, whoo
just like the white winged dove
sings a song
sounds like she's singin'
said, whoo, baby, whoo
said, whoo

the clouds never expect it
when it rains
but the sea changes colours
but the sea
does not change
so with the slow graceful flow
of age
i went forth with an age old
desire to please
on the edge of seventeen

just like the white winged dove
sings a song
sounds like she's singin'
whoo, baby, whoo, whoo
just like the white winged dove
sings a song
sounds like she's singin'
said, whoo, baby, whoo
said, whoo

well then suddenly
there was no one left standing
in the hall, yeah, yeah
in a flood of tears
that no one really ever heard fall at all
when i went searchin' for an answer
up the stairs and down the hall
not to find an answer
just to hear the call
of a nightbird singin'
 come away 
 come away 
 come away 

just like the white winged dove
sings a song
sounds like she's singin'
whoo, baby, whoo, whoo
just like the white winged dove
sings a song
sounds like she's singin'
said, whoo, baby, whoo
said, whoo

well, i hear you  well, i hear you 
in the morning  in the morning 
and i hear you  and i hear you 
at nightfall  at nightfall 
sometimes to be near you
is to be unable to hear you
my love
i'm a few years older than you, my love
 i'm a few years older than you 

just like the white winged dove
sings a song
sounds like she's singin'
whoo, baby, whoo
said, whoo
just like the white winged dove
sings a song
sounds like she's singin'
whoo, baby, whoo
said, whoo


i've known faces that have disappeared in time
find me wrapped in glass and slowly soaked in lime
all my friends have pictures made to make you cry
i've seen this and wondered what i've done to calcify

i ignore you
as i close my eyes, i feel it all slipping away
i come toward you
we all got left behind, we let it all slip away
i ignore you
as i close my eyes, i feel it all slipping away
i come toward you
we all got left behind, we let it all slip away

i can't stand to see your thalidomide robot face
i don't even try it
you had to be a liar just to infiltrate me
i'm still drowning

i ignore you
as i close my eyes, i feel it all slipping away
i come toward you
we all got left behind, we let it all slip away
i ignore you
as i close my eyes, i feel it all slipping away
i come toward you
we all got left behind, we let it all slip away

take this away
take this away
i can feel it on my mouth
i can taste you on my fingers
i can hear you like the holy ghost
and kill you if you get too close

i ignore you
as i close my eyes, i feel it all slipping away
i come toward you
we all got left behind, we let it all slip away
i ignore you
as i close my eyes, i feel it all slipping away
i come toward you
we all got left behind, we let it all slip away

we let it all slip away
we let it all slip away
we let it all slip away
we let it all slip away
we let it all slip away
we let it all slip away

cease to resist, giving my goodbye
drive my car into the ocean
you'll think i'm dead, but i sail away
on a wave of mutilation
wave of mutilation
wave of mutilation
wave
wave
i've kissed mermaids, rode the el ni o
walked the sand with the crustaceans
could find my way to mariana
on a wave of mutilation
wave of mutilation
wave of mutilation
wave
wave
wave of mutilation
wave of mutilation
wave of mutilation
wave
wave



rising up, back on the street
did my time, took my chances
went the distance, now i'm back on my feet
just a man and his will to survive
so many times it happens too fast
you trade your passion for glory
don't lose your grip on the dreams of the past
you must fight just to keep them alive

it's the eye of the tiger
it's the thrill of the fight
rising up to the challenge of our rival
and the last known survivor
stalks his prey in the night
and he's watching us all
with the eye of the tiger

face to face, out in the heat
hanging tough, staying hungry
they stack the odds 'til we take to the street
for the kill with the skill to survive

it's the eye of the tiger
it's the thrill of the fight
rising up to the challenge of our rival
and the last known survivor
stalks his prey in the night
and he's watching us all
with the eye of the tiger

rising up, straight to the top
had the guts, got the glory
went the distance, now i'm not going to stop
just a man and his will to survive

it's the eye of the tiger
it's the thrill of the fight
rising up to the challenge of our rival
and the last known survivor
stalks his prey in the night
and he's watching us all
with the eye of the tiger

the eye of the tiger
the eye of the tiger
the eye of the tiger
the eye of the tiger


you jump in front of my car when you
you know all the time that
ninety miles an hour, girl, is the speed i drive
you tell me it's alright, you don't mind a little pain
you say you just want me to take you for a ride

you're just like crosstown traffic
so hard to get through to you
crosstown traffic
i don't need to run over you
crosstown traffic
all you do is slow me down
and i'm trying to get on the other side of town

i'm not the only soul who's accused of hit and run
tire tracks all across your back
i can see you had your fun
but darling can't you see my signals turn from green to red
and with you i can see a traffic jam straight up ahead

you're just like crosstown traffic
so hard to get through to you
crosstown traffic
i don't need to run over you
crosstown traffic
all you do is slow me down

carry on my wayward son
there'll be peace when you are done
lay your weary head to rest
don't you cry no more

once i rose above the noise and confusion
just to get a glimpse beyond this illusion
i was soaring ever higher
but i flew too high
though my eyes could see i still was a blind man
though my mind could think i still was a mad man
i hear the voices when i'm dreaming
i can hear them say

carry on my wayward son
there'll be peace when you are done
lay your weary head to rest
don't you cry no more

masquerading as a man with a reason
my charade is the event of the season
and if i claim to be a wise man, well
it surely means that i don't know
on a stormy sea of moving emotion
tossed about i'm like a ship on the ocean
i set a course for winds of fortune
but i hear the voices say

carry on my wayward son
there'll be peace when you are done
lay your weary head to rest
don't you cry no more
no 


carry on, you will always remember
carry on, nothing equals the splendor
now your life's no longer empty
but surely heaven waits for you

carry on my wayward son
there'll be peace when you are done
lay your weary head to rest
don't you cry
don't you cry no more

no more 


why do you come here ?
and why do you hang around ?
i'm so sorry
i'm so sorry

why do you come here
when you know it makes things hard for me ?
when you know, oh
why do you come ?
why do you telephone ?  hmm... 
and why send me silly notes ?
i'm so sorry
i'm so sorry

why do you come here
when you know it makes things hard for me ?
when you know, oh
why do you come here
you had to sneak into my room
'just' to read my diary
"it was just to see, just to see"
 all the things you knew i'd written about you... 
oh, so many illustrations
oh, but
i'm so very sickened
oh, i am so sickened now

oh, it was a good lay, good lay
it was a good lay, good lay
it was a good lay, good lay
oh oh
it was a good lay, good lay
it was a good lay, good lay
oh, it was a good lay, good lay
oh
oh, it was a good lay

 put your ladder down, put your ladder down
put your ladder down, put your ladder down 
don t be concerned
it s just the way that gravity works 'round here
all slowly rising, falling patiently
feel no, feel no fear
cirrus caress you, cumulus kiss you
raindrops of crystal whisper, "we ll miss you"
but go
let go

always and always and always ascending
the opening line leaves an uncertain ending
always and always and always ascending
the chords seem to pause, but ahh 

never gonna resolve  never going to resolve 
never gonna resolve  never going to resolve 
never gonna resolve  never going to resolve 
never gonna resolve  never going to resolve 
ah, talk to me  talk to me 
c'mon, talk to me  talk to me 
yeah, talk to me  talk to me 
ahh, oh
yeah, wake me up
c'mon wake me up

waking up dry, waking up dusty
feeling remorse, feeling thirsty
bring me a cup, bring me water
we can ascend from this arrangement
we can see fate as entertainment
bring me a cup, bring me water
bring me water

always and always and always ascending
the shepard misleads so you think you re transcending
always and always and always ascending
pause the progression, but ahh 

never gonna resolve  never going to resolve 
never gonna resolve  never going to resolve 
never gonna resolve  never going to resolve 
never gonna resolve  never going to resolve 
ah, talk to me  talk to me 
c'mon, talk to me  talk to me

all my life i've been searching for something
something never comes, never leads to nothing
nothing satisfies, but i'm getting close
closer to the prize at the end of the rope
all night long i dream of the day
when it comes around, then it's taken away
leaves me with the feeling that i feel the most
the feeling comes to life when i see your ghost

come down don't you resist
you have such a delicate wrist
and if i give it a twist
something to hold when i lose my grip
will i find something in there?
so give me just what i need
another reason to bleed
one by one, hidden up my sleeve
one by one, hidden up my sleeve

hey, don't let it go to waste
i love it, but i hate the taste
weight keep pinning me down
hey, don't let it go to waste
i love it, but i hate the taste
weight keep pinning me down

will i find a believer?
another one who believes?
another one to deceive?
over and over, down on my knees
if i get any closer
and if you open up wide
and if you let me inside
on and on, i've got nothing to hide
on and on, i've got nothing to hide

hey, don't let it go to waste
i love it, but i hate the taste
weight keep pinning me down
hey, don't let it go to waste
i love it, but i hate the taste
weight keep pinning me down

all my life i've been searching for something
something never comes, never leads to nothing
nothing satisfies, but i'm getting close
closer to the prize at the end of the rope
all night long i dream of the day
when it comes around, then it's taken away
leaves me with the feeling that i feel the most
the feeling comes to life when i see your ghost
and i'm done, done, on to the next one
done, done and i'm on to the next one
done, done and i'm on to the next one
done, done and i'm on to the next one
done, done and i'm on to the next one
done, done and i'm on to the next one
done, done and i'm on to the next one
done, i'm done and i'm on to the next...
done, done, on to the next one
done, i'm done and i'm on to the next one
done, done; on to the next one
done, i'm done and i'm on to the next...

hey, don't let it go to waste
i love it, but i hate the taste
weight keep pinning me down
hey, don't let it go to waste

i was born in the desert, may 17 in '73
when the needle hit the groove
i commence to moving
i was chasing what's calling me

oh oh oh, feet don't fail me now
one foot in the gutter
one in the clouds
feet don't fail me now
i just gotta move on

life is hard that's why no one survives
i'm much older than i thought i'd be
feel like a fool, yeah, like a dancing fool, yeah
footloose and fancy free

oh oh oh, feet don't fail me now
stand in the gutter with my head in the clouds
feet don't fail me now
i just gotta move on

push myself, the breaking point
it's all i know to do except for lie
i chase brake lights and dust ad nauseam
driven by feelings i cannot hide
to be so civilized, one must tell civil lies
on and on and on and on and...

me and my gang come to bust you loose
we move with an urgency
between pleasure and agony, on a runaway line
that's the sound that's calling me
it's calling me
it's calling me
it's calling me
it's calling me
it's calling me
it's calling me
it's calling me
it's calling me
it's

time to go, regret it later
we're gon' take it as it comes
future tense meets middle finger
we take the long way home

oh oh oh, feet don't fail me now
do whatcha gotta do
oh do it now
feet don't fail me now
i just gotta move on


don't wanna be an american idiot
don't want a nation under the new media
and can you hear the sound of hysteria?
the subliminal mind fuck america

welcome to a new kind of tension
all across the alien nation
where everything isn't meant to be okay
television dreams of tomorrow
we're not the ones who're meant to follow
for that's enough to argue

well, maybe i'm the faggot, america
i'm not a part of a redneck agenda
now everybody do the propaganda
and sing along to the age of paranoia

welcome to a new kind of tension
all across the alien nation
where everything isn't meant to be okay
television dreams of tomorrow
we're not the ones who're meant to follow
for that's enough to argue


don't wanna be an american idiot
one nation controlled by the media
information age of hysteria
it's calling out to idiot america

welcome to a new kind of tension
all across the alien nation
where everything isn't meant to be okay
television dreams of tomorrow
we're not the ones who're meant to follow
for that's enough to argue


dear, i fear we're facing a problem
you love me no longer, i know and
maybe there is nothing that i can do
to make you do
mama tells me i shouldn't bother
that i ought just to stick to another man
a man that surely deserves me
but i think you do

so i cry, and i pray, and i beg

love me, love me
say that you love me
fool me, fool me
go on and fool me
love me, love me
pretend that you love me
leave me, leave me
just say that you need me
so i cry and i beg for you to
love me, love me
say that you love me
leave me, leave me
just say that you need me
i can't care about anything but you

lately i have desperately pondered
spent my nights awake and i wonder
what i could have done in another way
to make you stay
reason will not lead to solution
i will end up lost in confusion
i don't care if you really care
as long as you don't go

so i cry, and i pray, and i beg

love me, love me
say that you love me
fool me, fool me
go on and fool me
love me, love me
pretend that you love me
leave me, leave me
just say that you need me
so i cry and i beg for you to
love me, love me
say that you love me
leave me, leave me
just say that you need me
i can't care about anything but you
 anything but you 

love me, love me
say that you love me
fool me, fool me
go on and fool me
love me, love me
i know that you need me
i can't care about anything but you



rising up, back on the street
did my time, took my chances
went the distance, now i'm back on my feet
just a man and his will to survive
so many times it happens too fast
you trade your passion for glory
don't lose your grip on the dreams of the past
you must fight just to keep them alive

it's the eye of the tiger

i sit around and watch the tube, but nothin's on
i change the channels for an hour or two
twiddle my thumbs just for a bit
i'm sick of all the same old shit
in a house with unlocked doors
and i'm fuckin' lazy

bite my lip and close my eyes
take me away to paradise
i'm so damn bored, i'm going blind
and i smell like shit

peel me off this velcro seat and get me moving
i sure as hell can't do it by myself
i'm feeling like a dog in heat
barred indoors from the summer street
i locked the door to my own cell
and i lost the key

bite my lip and close my eyes
take me away to paradise
i'm so damn bored, i'm going blind
and i smell like shit

i got no motivation
where is my motivation?
no time for motivation
smoking my inspiration

i sit around and watch the phone, but no one's calling
call me pathetic, call me what you will
my mother says to get a job
but she don't like the one she's got
when masturbation's lost its fun
you're fucking lonely

bite my lip and close my eyes
take me away to paradise
i'm so damn bored, i'm going blind
and loneliness has to suffice

bite my lip and close my eyes
i'm slipping away to paradise
some say quit or i'll go blind
but it's just a myth


highway run into the midnight sun
wheels go round and round, you're on my mind
restless hearts sleep alone tonight
sending all my love along the wire

they say that the road ain't no place to start a family
right down the line it's been you and me
and lovin' a music man ain't always what it's supposed to be
oh, girl, you stand by me
i'm forever yours, faithfully

circus life under the big top world
we all need the clowns to make us smile
through space and time, always another show
wondering where i am, lost without you

and being apart ain't easy on this love affair
two strangers learn to fall in love again
i get the joy of rediscovering you
oh, girl, you stand by me
i'm forever yours, faithfully

whoa, oh oh ooh
whoa, oh oh ooh, oh
whoa, oh oh oh, oh whoooooa oh
faithfully
i'm still yours
i'm forever yours
ever yours
faithfully

ohhh.. yeah..

i feel a hunger, it's a hunger
that tries to keep a man awake at night
are you the answer? i shouldn't wonder
when i can feel you whet my appetite
with all the power you're releasing
it isn't safe to walk the city streets alone
anticipation is running through me
let's find the keys and turn this engine on

i can feel you breathe
i can feel your heart beat faster  faster 

take me home tonight
i don't want to let you go 'til you see the light
take me home tonight
listen, honey, just like ronnie sang
be my little baby, oh, ho, oh

i get frightened in all this darkness
i get nightmares i hate to sleep alone
i need some company a guardian angel
to keep me warm when the cold winds blow

i can feel you breathe
i can feel your heart beat faster  faster 

take me home tonight
i don't want to let you go 'til you see the light
take me home tonight
listen, honey , just like ronnie sang
be my little baby
be my little baby, uh huh
just like ronnie sang
i said

when i was just a little boy like you
i wanted to do things the big boys do
wherever they went you knew they wouldn't let me go
and i got suspicious and i wanted to know
i was bright in school but my future looked dim
'cause the big boys wouldn't let me party with them

yes, yes

all of the big girls with their to
when i ask 'em what's happening, nobody knew
but when i found out where, what, when, and why
i didn't let a single week pass by
till the school dance when i first met you
and i learned to party like the big boys do

yes, yes
i didn't cry
yes, yes
and you know why

when i was little bitty boy

if i would have known what makes a world go 'round
i would have known what goes up must come down
if you love me like i love you
mademoiselle, je vous aime, voulez vous?
the girls want to stay and the boys want to play
so let's a rock and roll till the break of day

yes, yes
i didn't cry
yes, yes
and you know why
yes, yes
i knew when and what
yes, yes
no ifs, ands, or buts
i was looking for joy
yes, yes, yes, yes
when i was little bitty boy


it was 1989, my thoughts were short my hair was long
caught somewhere between a boy and man
she was seventeen and she was far from in between
it was summertime in northern michigan
ahh ahh ahh
ahh ahh ahh

splashing through the sand bar
talking by the campfire
it's the simple things in life, like when and where
we didn't have no internet
but man, i never will forget
the way the moonlight shined upon her hair

and we were trying different things
we were smoking funny things
making love out by the lake to our favorite song
sipping whiskey out the bottle, not thinking 'bout tomorrow
singing sweet home alabama all summer long
singing sweet home alabama all summer long

catching wild life from the dock
watching the waves roll off the rocks
she'll forever hold a spot inside my soul
we'd blister in the sun
we couldn't wait for night to come
to hit that sand and play some rock and roll

while we were trying different things
we were smoking funny things
making love out by the lake to our favorite song
sipping whiskey out the bottle, not thinking 'bout tomorrow
singing sweet home alabama all summer long
singing sweet home alabama all summer long

now nothing seems as strange as when the leaves began to change
or how we thought those days would never end
sometimes i'll hear that song and i'll start to sing along
and think man i'd love to see that girl again

and we were trying different things
we were smoking funny things
making love out by the lake to our favorite song
sipping whiskey out the bottle, not thinking 'bout tomorrow
singing sweet home alabama all summer long
singing sweet home alabama all summer long
and we were trying different things
we were smoking funny things
making love out by the lake to our favorite song
sipping whiskey out the bottle, not thinking 'bout tomorrow
singing sweet home alabama all summer long
singing sweet home alabama all summer long

singing sweet home alabama all summer long
singing sweet home alabama all summer long
singing sweet home alabama all summer long
singing sweet home alabama all summer long

well, outside my window there's a whole lotta trouble comin'
the cartoon killers and the rag cover clones
stack heels kickin' rhythm of social circumcision
can't close the closet on a shoe box full of bones
kangaroo lady with her bourbon in a pouch
can't afford the rental on a bamboo couch
collecting back her favors cause her well is running dry
i know her act is terminal, but she ain't gonna die, no
slim intoxicado drinkin' dime store hooch
is always in a circle with his part time pooch
little creepy's playing dollies in the new york rain
thinkin' bowie's just a knife
whoa, the pain 
i ain't seen the sun since i don't know when
the freaks come out at nine
and it's twenty to ten
what's this funk
that you call junk?
to me it's just monkey business
get back 
blind man in a box and he'll probably die
the village kids laugh as they walk by
a psycho on the edge of this human garbage dump
and the vultures in the sewers are telling
him to jump
into the fire, from the frying pan
tripping on his tongue
for a cool place to stand
where's this shade
that you've got it made?
to me it's just monkey business
 monkey business  slippin' on the track
 monkey business  jungle in black
 ain't your business  if i got no monkey on my back
 monkey business  slippin' on the track
 monkey business  jungle in black
 ain't your business  if i got no monkey on my back
the vaseline gypsies and silicone souls
dressed to the society
hypocrite heartbeat and cheap alibis
can't get you by that monkey
 monkey business  slippin' on the track
 monkey business  jungle in black
 ain't your business  if i got no monkey on my back
 monkey business  slippin' on the track
 monkey business  jungle in black
 ain't your business  if i got no monkey on my back
 monkey business  you can't tell me, i got no business
 ain't your business  no monkey on my back
yeah, yay, cool
monkey business, ness, business
don't give me no business, no

your mouth, so hot
your web, i'm caught
your skin, so wet
black lace, on sweat

remold into gold and bury i from sun
reborn, left to sigh
recure, maybe i'll
be born and simplify
the way i lie, before

i get bored

revered by you
and trust to figure out

when i see my brother
what i see is like no other
what we had forever lost
can't deny our friendship
feeling like it's time to end this
bad relation ripped apart
when we were young
and disaranged
we didn't know it
any other way
now were grown
he's still the same
people see him suffering
i am not about to run away
turn my back to him
in his darkest hour
give him will to fight
antagonize his thoughts
see him thew his toughest times
purify his weakened heart
all the friends
we feel the same
the way it was
back in the day
the more we change
he stays the same
will we ever see our friend again
i... feel that...
i can't protect my friend from himself
all i've got
are these lessons learned in life
the lessons i've been taught
they still remain
inside me thoughts
even as we speak
as troubled as it seems
he'll always be a friend of mine
that's the way it was
and always will be
when we were young
and disaranged
we didn't know it
any other way
now were grown
he's still the same
people see him suffering
i... feel...
i cannot help my friend
help him self
you... can't hear what i say
never going away...
still friends down for life...
can you still fight...
all i've got
are these lessons learned in life
the lessons i've been taught
they still remain
inside my thoughts
even as we speak
as troubled as it seems
he'll always be a friend of mine
that's the way it was
and always will be
now in the end
it plain to see
what kind of friend
he has been for me
all along he could never see
who he was
and always be


in the cool of the evening
when everything is gettin' kind of groovy
you call me up and ask me
would i like to go with you and see a movie
first i say no, i've got some plans for the night
and then i stop
and say "all right"
love is kinda crazy with a spooky little boy like you

you always keep me guessin'
i never seem to know what you are thinking
and if a girl looks at you
it's for sure your little eye will be a winkin'
i get confused, i never know where i stand
and then you smile
and hold my hand
love is kinda crazy with a spooky little boy like you
spooky

if you decide someday to stop this little game that you are playing
i'm gonna tell you all the things my heart's been a dyin' to be saying
just like a ghost you've been a hauntin' my dreams
but now i know
you're not what you seem
love is kinda crazy with a spooky little boy like you

spooky, spooky, oh whoa, all right
spooky, oh yea yea
i said spooky yea yea

restless sinner rest in sin
he's got no face to hold him in
he fills his days as dark as night
he's been waiting with the blind
just to find a place to hide his ghost
unopened eyes, no consequence
the door's been closed since he's walked in
the fight's been raging so many days
he'll greet you with a cross and a sickle
as he helps you in
you fall in waste, an open fire
you've got no taste for his desire
he brings you in to warm your bones
he's the reason why you came
and the reason why you ought to go
fool's gonna fall and raise
another fallen child
fool's gonna fall and raise
another fallen child
fool's gonna fall and raise
another fallen child
it can't be known what lies in wait
for those of us in crippled states
a broken mind is no escape
when there's no one left to reason with
there's no one left to call your name
fool's gonna fall and raise
another fallen child
fool's gonna fall and raise
another fallen child
fool's gonna fall and raise
another fallen child
fool's gonna fall and raise
another fallen child

indestructible
on this rock, i lie, but i'm alive for good
and i just free myself now from all what was wrong
break the unbreakable

all the stars fearlessly bright
they call me out there, order me to face the wind
my structure's alive, body's on the way
don't bow down before the walls
of fear and madness, they try to counter me
and strike me down to the ground again

inexhaustible
the strength of fire is running through me
spine like beam of light
what mortal could ever break this force?
unconstrained
i see at last my backbone straighten
thy serpent made of bones
finally rise up from the ground awaken

beat your feet on the ground now, go


an ending fitting for the start
you twist'n'tore our love apart
your light fingers threw the dart
that shattered the lamp and into darkness cast us

no, you've got it the wrong way round
you shut me up, and blamed it on the brown
cornered the boy kicked out at the world
the world kicked back a lot fuckin' harder now

if you want to try
if you want to try
there's no worse you could do
uh oh oh
i know you lie
i know you lie
i'm still in love with you
uh oh oh
can't take me anywhere
i'd take you anywhere
you can't take me anywhere
well, i can't take you anywhere
i'll take you anywhere you want to go

oh, you can't stand me now, no you can't stand me now
no, you can't stand me now, no you can't stand me now

oh maybe, maybe it's the clothes we wear
the tasteless bracelets and the dye in our hair
maybe it's our kookiness
or maybe, maybe it's our nowhere towns
our nothing places and our cellophane sounds
maybe it's our looseness

but we're trash, you and me
we're the litter on the breeze
we're the lovers on the streets
just trash, me and you
it's in everything we do
it's in everything we do

oh maybe, maybe it's the things we say
the words we've heard and the music we play
maybe it's our cheapness
or maybe, maybe it's the times we've had
the lazy days and the crazes and the fads
maybe it's our sweetness

but we're trash, you and me
we're the litter on the breeze
we're the lovers on the streets
just trash, me and you
it's in everything we do
it's in everything we do

stay with me awhile
rise above the vile
name my final rest
poured into my chest

into the orchard i walk peering way past the gate
wilted scenes for us who couldn't wait
drained by the coldest caress, stalking shadows ahead
halo of death, all i see is departure
mourner's lament, but it's me who's the martyr

pledge yourself to me
never leave me be
sweat breaks on my brow
given time ends now

into the orchard i walk peering way past the gate
wilted scenes for us who couldn't wait
drained by the coldest caress, stalking shadows ahead
halo of death, all i see is departure
mourner's lament, but it's me who's the martyr

spirit painted sin
embers neath my skin
veiled in pale embrace
reached and touched my face

into the orchard i walk peering way past the gate
wilted scenes for us who couldn't wait
drained by the coldest caress, stalking shadows ahead
 release your grip, let me go, into the night 
halo of death, all i see is departure
mourner's lament, but it's me who's the martyr

i did join the race
hunting for success
selling dreams was all i knew
for the rising stars and i did work hard my important part
all my feelings are with you
where i am
where you are
and i changed my life
and i moved outside
where the water is clear and pure
where the lands are wide
where the air is bright
all my feelings are with you
where i am
where you are
and i walk up the hill
and i can't stand still
'till the day of our last rendez vous
and the leaves turn red
and i bow my head
all my feelings are with you
where i am
where you are

if i could reach the stars
pull one down for you
shine it on my heart
so you could see the truth
that this love i have inside
is everything it seems
but for now i find
it's only in my dreams

and i can change the world
i will be the sunlight in your universe
you would think my love was really something good
baby if i could change the world

if i could be king
even for a day
i'd take you as my queen
i'd have it no other way
and our love would rule
in this kingdom we have made
'til then i'd be a fool
wishing for the day

and i can change the world
i would be the sunlight in your universe
you would think my love was really something good
baby if i could change the world
baby if i could change the world

i could change the world
i would be the sunlight in your universe
you would think my love was really something good
baby if i could change the world
baby if i could change the world
baby if i could change the world


i close my eyes, only for a moment
and the moment's gone
all my dreams pass before my eyes, a curiosity

dust in the wind
all they are is dust in the wind

same old song, just a drop of water
in an endless sea
all we do crumbles to the ground
though we refuse to see

dust in the wind
all we are is dust in the wind

oh, ho, ho


now, don't hang on, nothing lasts forever but the earth and sky
it slips away, and all your money won't another minute buy

dust in the wind
all we are is dust in the wind
 all we are is dust in the wind 
dust in the wind
 everything is dust in the wind 
everything is dust in the wind

the wind


they've sped up to the point where they provoke
the punchline before they have told the joke
plenty of desperation to be seen
staring at the television screen
they've sped up to the point where they provoke
you to tell the fucking punchline before you have told the joke
well sorry, sunshine, it doesn't exist
it wasn't in the top 100 list

and it's the thousandth time that it's even bolder
don't be surprised when you get bent over
they told you, but you were dying for it

she saw it and she grabbed it and it wasn't what it seemed
the kids all dream of making it, whatever that means
another variation on a theme
a tangle on the television and the magazine
d'you reckon that they do it for a joke?
d'you reckon that they make 'em take an oath
that says that "we are defenders of any poser
or professional pretender around"

and when did your list replace the twist and turn
like a fist replaced a kiss?
don't concern us with your bollocks, i don't want your prayer
save it for the morning after


and it's the thousandth time that it's even bolder
don't be surprised when you get bent over
they told you, but you were gagging for it

let's have a game on the teddy picker
not quick enough, can i have it quicker?
already thick and you're getting thicker
let's have a game on the teddy picker
not quick enough, can i have it quicker?
already thick and you're getting thicker

presuming that all things are equal
who'd want to be men of the people
when there's people like you?


did you see the stylish kids in the riot?
shovelled up like muck and set the night on fire
wombles bleed, truncheons and shields
you know i cherish you my love

but there's a rumour spread nasty disease around town
you caught round the houses with your trousers down
a headrush in the bush
you know i cherish you my love
oh how i cherish you my love

tell me what can you want now you've got it all
the whole scene is obscene
time will strip it away
a year and a day
and bill bones
bill bones knows what i mean

he knows it's eating, it's chewing me up
it's not right for young lungs to be coughing up blood
and it's all
it's all in my hands
and it's all up the walls

well the stale chips are up and the hope stakes are down
it's all these ignorant faces that bring this town down
and i sighed and sunken with pride
well i passed myself down on my knees
yes i passed myself down on my knees

now tell me what can you want now you've got it all
the whole scene is obscene
time will strip it away
a year and a day
and bill bones
bill bones knows what i mean

he knows there's fewer more distressing sights than that
of an englishman in a baseball cap
and we'll die in the class we were born
but that's a class of our own my love
a class of our own my love

did you see the stylish kids in the riot
shovelled up like muck
set the night on fire
wombles bleed truncheons and shields
you know i cherish you my love
yeah i cherish you my love

what good are words i say to you?
they can't convey to you what's in my heart
if you could hear instead
the things i've left unsaid
time after time
i tell myself that i'm
so lucky to be loving you
so lucky to be
the one you run to see
in the evening, when the day is through
i only know what i know
the passing years will show
you've kept my love so young, so new
and time after time
you'll hear me say that i'm
so lucky to be loving you
i only know what i know
the passing years will show
you've kept my love so young, so new
and time after time
you'll hear me say that i'm
so lucky to be loving you
lucky to be loving you


oscillate yourself tonight
when you're in your bed
simulate the dopamine
passing through your head

when you get back on a saturday night
and the room is caving in

do you look like me? do you feel like me?
do you turn into your effigy?
do you dance like this forever?

see yourself in cupid's lake
chipped in your head
do you indicate to satellites
passing by the edge?

when you get back on a saturday night
and your head is caving in

do you look like me? do you feel like me?
do you turn into your effigy?
do you dance like this forever?
do you dance like this forever?

do you look like me?
do you burn like me?
do you look like me?
do you burn like me?
do you look like me?
do you burn like me?
do you turn into your effigy?

do you dance like this forever?
do you dance like this forever?

 do you dance? 
 do you dance? 
 do you dance? 
 do you dance? 

no one looked...as i walked by
just an invitation would have been just fine
said no to him...again and again
first he took my heart...and then he ran
no one knows how i feel
what i said unless you read between my lines
one man walked away from me
first he took my hand...take me home
stand back...stand back
in the middle of my room
i did not hear from you
it's alright...it's alright
to be standing in a line
 standing in a line 
to be standing in a line
i cry...
do not turn away my friend
like a willow i can bend
no man calls my name
no man came
so i walked on down away from you
maybe your attention was more
than you could do
one man did not call
he asked me for my love
and that was all
stand back...stand back
in the middle of my room
i did not hear from you
it's alright...it's alright
to be standing in a line
 standing in a line 
to be standing in a line
i cry..
so i walked on down the line
away from you
maybe your attention was more
than i could do
one man...did not call
well he asked me for my love
that was all
stand back... stand back
in the middle of my room i did not hear from you
its alright... its alright
to be standing in a line
 standing in a line 
to be standing in a line
i cry...
 repeat once more 

winding your way down on baker street
light in your head and dead on your feet
well, another crazy day
you'll drink the night away
and forget about everything
this city desert makes you feel so cold
it's got so many people, but it's got no soul
and it's taken you so long
to find out you were wrong
when you thought it held everything
you used to think that it was so easy
you used to say that it was so easy
but you're trying, you're trying now
another year and then you'd be happy
just one more year and then you'd be happy
but you're crying, you're crying now
way down the street there's a light in his place
he opens the door, he's got that look on his face
and he asks you where you've been
you tell him who you've seen
and you talk about anything
he's got this dream about buying some land
he's gonna give up the booze and the one night stands
and then he'll settle down
in some quiet little town
and forget about everything
but you know he'll always keep moving
you know he's never gonna stop moving
'cause he's rolling, he's the rolling stone
and when you wake up, it's a new morning
the sun is shining, it's a new morning
and you're going, you're going home


sometimes i feel the fear of uncertainty stinging clear
and i, i can't help but ask myself
how much i let the fear take the wheel and steer

it's driven me before
and it seems to have a vague, haunting mass appeal
but lately i'm
beginning to find that i should be the one behind the wheel

whatever tomorrow brings i ll be there
with open arms and open eyes, yeah
whatever tomorrow brings i ll be there
i ll be there

so if i decide to waiver my chance
to be one of the hive
will i choose water over wine
and hold my own and drive?

it's driven me before
and it seems to be the way, that everyone else gets around
but lately i'm
beginning to find that when i drive myself, my light is found

whatever tomorrow brings i ll be there
with open arms and open eyes, yeah
whatever tomorrow brings i ll be there
i ll be there

would you choose water over wine?
hold the wheel and drive

whatever tomorrow brings i ll be there
with open arms and open eyes, yeah
whatever tomorrow brings i ll be there
i ll be there


i dig my toes into the sand
the ocean looks like a thousand diamonds strewn across a blue blanket
i lean against the wind, pretend that i am weightless
and in this moment i am happy happy

i wish you were here
i wish you were here
i wish you were here
i wish you were here

i lay my head onto the sand
the sky resembles a back lit canopy with holes punched in it
i'm counting ufos, i signal them with my lighter
and in this moment i am happy happy

i wish you were here
i wish you were here
i wish you were here
i wish you were here

the world's a roller coaster
and i am not strapped in
maybe i should hold with care
but my hands are busy in the air saying

i wish you were here
i wish you were...

i wish you were here
i wish you were here
i wish you were...
here, wish you were here


yeah
here we go

it's a new day but it all feels old
"it's a good life"   that's what i'm told
but every day, it all just feels the same
at my high school it felt more to me
like a jail cell, a penitentiary
my time spent there   it only made me see
that i don't ever wanna be like you
i don't wanna do the things you do
i'm never gonna to hear the words you say and...

i don't ever wanna  i don't ever wanna be you
don't wanna be just like you
uh, what i'm saying is
this is the anthem, throw all your hands up
you, don't wanna be you

"go to college or university
get a real job"   that's what they said to me
but i could never live the way they want
i'm going to get by and just do my time
outta step while they all get in line
i'm just a minor threat so pay no mind
do you really wanna to be like them?
do you really wanna be another trend?
do you wanna be part of that crowd? 'cause...

i don't ever wanna  i don't ever wanna be you
don't wanna be just like you
uh, what i'm saying is
this is the anthem, throw all your hands up
you, don't wanna be you

shake it once, that's fine
shake it twice, that's okay
shake it three times
you're playing with your self again
 you, don't wanna be just like you 
what i'm saying is
this is the anthem, throw all your hands up
now you can feel me, sing if you're with me
you, don't wanna be just like you
 just like you 
this is the anthem, throw all your hands up
now you can feel me, sing if you're with me

another loser anthem  wahoo 
another loser anthem   wahoo 
another loser anthem   wahoo 
another loser anthem   wahoo 

she owns and operates
her own sunshine factory
of painting smiles on dolls
and then on me
she's my sunny girlfriend
and personality

that tells about ev'rybody's past
and she can make you slow
while making your mind move fast

then she comes creeping
into my thoughts at night
gazing down through eyes
as bright as wonder
she can send you on your way
to ev'rywhere
she's only started
after you think that she is there
well, she's my sunny girlfriend
and she just doesn't care
yes, she's my sunny girlfriend
she doesn't really care

share the same space for a minute or two
and you love me till my heart stops
love me till i'm dead
eyes that light up
eyes look through you
cover up the blank spots
hit me on the head i got ooh

love, only love
can bring back your love someday

i will be there, i will be there

if we'd go again
all the way from the start
i would try to change
the things that killed our love
your pride has built a wall, so strong
that i can't get through
is there really no chance
to start once again
i'm loving you

everything is perfect
everything is sick, and that's it
you can't tell me to stop it
you can't tell me not to quit
and that's it
revolve around yourself
it's you and no one else
hard for me to stay
swinging moods that change
from calmness to deranged
unpredictable, unpredictable
you would see if
only
you hadn't taken things out of my hands
only
you never wanted to understand
classic ways to live here
compromise for me
i'm at both ends of the spectrum
you're somewhere in between
come clean
revolve around yourself
it's you and no one else
hard for me to stay
swinging moods that change
from calmness to deranged
unpredictable, unpredictable
you would see if
only
you hadn't taken things out of my hands

when the night has come
and the land is dark
and the moon is the only light we'll see
no i won't be afraid, oh, i won't be afraid
just as long as you stand, stand by me

so darlin', darlin', stand by me, oh
stand by me
oh, stand, stand by me

if the sky that we look upon
should tumble and fall
or the mountains should crumble to the sea

just as long as you stand, stand by me

it's been around for a thousand years
and it'll be here for plenty more
it is the face hidden in disgrace
that has become now an open sore
it is a false messiah
it is the face of pain
the bringer of the bittersweet
the heretic insane

take my scars
through hands of god
i found a better way
to break the walls

fed all the lies and desensitized
taught to believe that it is the way
taught to divide and exactly why
you'll never understand my rage
you've never had to borrow
you've never had to steal
you eat it with your silver spoon
for me it's real

blood and concrete
piss and wine
whores that fuck
to feel divine
they'll clean their needles
in their shrine
in ignorance
it's bliss you find
why can't you
fuckin' open up your eyes?

when the night has come and the land is dark
and the moon is the only light we see
no, i won't be afraid, oh, i won't be afraid
just as long as you stand, stand by me
so darling, darling, stand by me, oh, stand by me
oh, stand, stand by me, stand by me
if the sky that we look upon should tumble and fall
or the mountain should crumble to the sea
i won't cry, i won't cry, no, i won't shed a tear
just as long as you stand, stand by me
and darling, darling, stand by me
darling, darling, stand by me
whenever you're in trouble
won't you stand by me, oh, stand by me

shut the bedroom window in the morning
go to the shop, make plans to be leaving
in the morning
thought i was sleeping it was just a dream
an alley cat chewing on dead meat
in the morning

out of the dark and into the light
when the morning comes i will be alright

when i leave i try not to wake her
tea and a toast to yesterday's capers
in the morning
she wrote my name on the red telephone box
when i got there she'd already rubbed it off
in the morning

out of the dark and into the light
when the morning comes i will be alright

and all this time i've watched it change
but it's still the same

in the morning
in the morning
in the morning
in the morning


okay

i'm feeling the way that i'm feeling myself
fuck everyone else
gotta remember that nobody is better than anyone else, here
 do you need some time to think it over? 
look what they do to you
look what they do to me
must be joking if you think that either one is free, here

get up off your knees, girl
stand face to face with your god
and find out what you are
 hello, my name is human 
hello, my name is human
and i came down from the stars
 hello, my name is human 

i'm ready for love, and i'm ready for war
but i'm ready for more
i know that nobody's ever been this fucking ready before, hey
 do you need some time to think it over? 
so figure it out, or don't figure it out
i figured it out
the bigger the river  the bigger the river 
the bigger the drought  the bigger the drought 

get up off your knees, boy
stand face to face with your god
and find out what you are
 hello, my name is human 
hello, my name is human
and i came down from the stars
 hello, my name is human 

fire world, i love you
fireworld

i'm up off my knees, girl
i'm face to face with myself
and i know who i am
 hello, my name is human 
i stole my power from the sun
i'm more than just a man
 no longer disillusioned 

 i'm not asking questions 
 'cause questions have answers 
 and i don't want answers 
i came down from the stars  so i'll take my chances 
 and what are the chances 
 that i could advance 
 on my own circumstances 
 said "what are the chances?" 
hello, my name is human  and what are the chances? 
 i don't want your answers 
 i'm not asking questions 
 so you keep your answers 
and i know who i am  so you keep your answers 
 i'm not asking questions 
 i'm taking my chances 


i think i need help
i'm drowning in myself

did someone turn the lights out?
or is it just another dark cloud in my head?

if i wanna make it another day

cause maybe this time the good stuff could last

you won me over
my orange cola got black flamingos crying for ya
well i'll see you later
i could be your faker
my hands shake like jellyfish when you're near

i cut off my head and my cheetah tongue

when they gave you roses and believed your wild excuses
you were sealing the deal
halfway down the road and ain't it
funny how the ghosts they fade and
suddenly appear

you went too far
oh, woman, now you're feeling the fear
'cause you've never been alone before, oh
and the wolf is at the door, oh
now it's better if you hold your breath and don't look down
at the pages of your paper crown

you reached out for more and as the waves hit
at the shore you felt
the fading of your will
choke back the metaphors
the bottom of the ladder ask me
if i love you still

you went too far
oh, woman, now you're feeling the fear
'cause you've never been alone before, oh
and the wolf is at the door, oh
and the hounds of hell, they won't lie down
on the ashes of your paper crown

in the bright light of the sun
will you make sure everyone can see your face?
you make fun of everyone who falls
and meantime they were saving you a place

'cause you've never been alone before, oh
and the wolf is at the door, oh
and the talking heads don't make a sound
at the aging of your paper crown
better if you don't look down
at the pages of your paper crown


some people think they're always right
others are quiet and uptight
others, they seem so very nice nice nice nice, oh
inside they might feel sad and wrong, oh no
twenty nine different attributes
only seven that you like, oh
twenty ways to see the world, oh
twenty ways to start a fight, oh

oh don't, don't, don't get up, i can't see the sunshine
i'll be waiting for you, baby, 'cause i'm through
sit me down, shut me up
i'll calm down and i'll get along with you

oh, men don't notice what they got
oh, women think of that a lot
one thousand ways to please your man, oh
not even one requires a plan, i know
and countless odd religions too

one stubborn way to turn your back, oh
this i've tried and now refuse, oh

oh don't, don't, don't get up, i can't see the sunshine
oh i'll be waiting for you, baby 'cause i'm through
sit me down, shut me up
i'll calm down and i'll get along with you, alright

shut me up, shut me up
and i'll get along with you


i'll be the one to show you the way
you'll be the one to always complain
3 in the morning come a bang, bang, bang
all out of fags and i just can't wait
cancel the thing that i said i'd do
i don't feel comfortable talking to you
unless you got the zipper fixed on my shoe
then i'll be in the lobby drinking for two

it's been too long since i left the shed
you kick the bucket and i'll swing my legs
always remember the pact that we made
too young to die but old is the grave

golden, fallen, heart

lonely is the night without you
just as lonely as a shepherd without sheep
and where flies the falcon
in the high sweet air
without hunting in the sprane valleys deer
she wears softness as a gown
she spreads magic all around
her feathers still untouched
she takes but nothing and she gives so much
she flies on strange wings
she flies on strange winds
she brings strange things
she flies on strange wings
she takes off when she desires
silence grows on her lips
she can bring you so much higher
she spreads love on all her trips, yeah
woke up this morning
and this feeling came to my head
to fly with her from sky to sky
'cause my mind seemed to be dead
so i floated up towards her
on my mutilated wings
but all the blackness sings against me now
it's the lady of the strange wings
she wears softness as a gown
she spreads magic all around
her feathers still untouched
she takes but nothing and she gives so much

waitress, more wine
we celebrate, the life and times of johnny make believe
he was the greatest liar, of all mankind
the biggest drunk, you ever saw alive
he was a devil, undisguised
he will be sorely missed tonight
and the next day, will never be the same
without the beautyful johnny make believe
so let's get high, laugh till we cry
always remember, his last words:
"farewell cruel world, all you pretty girls
don't send me flowers, hold me in your dreams"?
and then the spirit in the bottle
took our johnny for a ride
come on waitress, pour us more wine
to drown our grief, for johnny make believe
he tattooed my heart, branded my soul
he said: "go for true love, not for fool's gold"
la, la, la, la
la, la, la, la, la

in bad times, when it's dark and cold
you got no place to rest your soul
there's laughter behind your backs
then it seems the devil rules the deck
nothin' seems easy these days
or do i see it in a different way
the world is spinnin', well that's ok
tell me baby what's the price we pay
holy holy life, sometimes is lonely
holy holy life, sometimes is sad
holy holy life, sometimes is phoney
the sooner or later, they'll find you dead
why don't you take me down to a rabbit hole
where a man of peace can hide his soul
thinkin' about pollution and a birth control
better talk to the rabbits, it's somebodies fault
and maybe sometimes i'm pessimistic
and maybe it ain't so bad, it ain't so sick
i know i'm not the man of constant sorrow
and tell me is it the path of evil to follow
holy holy life, sometimes is lonely
holy holy life, sometimes is sad
holy holy life, sometimes is phoney
or sooner or later, they'll find you dead
holy holy life, sometimes is lonely
sometimes is phoney, sometimes is sad
holy holy life, sometimes is lonely
sometimes is phoney, sometimes is sad, so sad
holy holy life, sometimes is lonely
sometimes is phoney, sometimes is sad, so so sad
holy, holy, holy

carry on my wayward son
there'll be peace when you are done
lay your weary head to rest
don't you cry no more

once i rose above the noise and confusion
just to get a glimpse beyond this illusion
i was soaring ever higher
but i flew too high
though my eyes could see i still was a blind man
though my mind could think i still was a mad man
i hear the voices when i'm dreaming
i can hear them say

carry on my wayward son
there'll be peace when you are done
lay your weary head to rest
don't you cry no more

masquerading as a man with a reason
my charade is the event of the season
and if i claim to be a wise man, well
it surely means that i don't know
on a stormy sea of moving emotion
tossed about i'm like a ship on the ocean
i set a course for winds of fortune
but i hear the voices say

carry on my wayward son
there'll be peace when you are done
lay your weary head to rest
don't you cry no more
no 


carry on, you will always remember
carry on, nothing equals the splendor
now your life's no longer empty
but surely heaven waits for you

carry on my wayward son
there'll be peace when you are done
lay your weary head to rest
don't you cry
don't you cry no more

no more 


a heart of stone, a smoking gun
i can give you life, i can take it away
a heart of stone, a smoking gun
i'm working it out
why'd you feel so underrated?
why'd you feel so negated?

turning away from the light, becoming adult
turning into myself
i wanted to bite not destroy, to feel her underneath
turning into the light

she don't think straight
no, no, no, she don't think straight
she's got such a dirty mind and it never ever stops
and you don't taste like her and you never ever will
and we don't read the papers, we don't read the news
heaven's never enough, we will never be fooled

turning away from the light, becoming adult
turning into myself
i wanted to bite not destroy, to feel her underneath
turning into the light

and if you feel a little left behind
we will wait for you on the other side
and if you feel a little left behind
we will wait for you on the other side

'cause i'm on fire

'cause i'm on fire

but they bow down to him anyway
because it's better than being alone

if i was scared, i would
and if i was bored, you know i would
and if i was yours, but i'm not

now you're knocking at my door
saying, "please come out with us tonight"
but i would rather be alone
than pretend i feel alright
if the businessmen are drinking my blood
like the kids at art school said they would
then i guess i'll just begin again

and if i was yours, but i'm not
now i'm ready to start

than live in the shadows of your song
my mind is open wide

not sure you'll open the door
to step out into the dark

after the glow, the scene, the stage, the set
talk becomes slow, but there's one thing i'll never forget
hey, you gotta pay your dues before you pay the rent
over the turnstiles and out in the traffic
there's ways of living; it's the way i'm living
right or wrong, it's all that i can do and i wouldn't wanna let you be

i want a range life
if i could settle down
if i could settle down
then i would settle down
i want a range life
if i could settle down
if i could settle down
then i would settle down

run from the pigs, the fuzz, the cops, the heat
pass me your gloves, this crime, it is never complete
until you snort it up and shoot it down, you're never gonna feel free
out on my skateboard, the night is just humming
and the gums smacks are the pulse i'll follow if my walkman fades
but i've got absolutely no one, no one but myself to blame

but don't worry, we're in no hurry
school's out, what did you expect?

i want a range life
if i could settle down
if i could settle down
then i would settle down
i want a range life
if i could settle down
if i could settle down
then i would settle down

out on tour with the smashing pumpkins
nature kids, i, they don't have no function
i don't understand what they mean and i could really give a fuck
the stone temple pilots, they're elegant bachelors
they're foxy to me, are they foxy to you?
i will agree they deserve absolutely nothing, nothing more than me

dreamin', dream dream dream dream dream


i was blind, now i can see
you made a believer out of me
i was blind, now i can see
you made a believer out of me

i believe in you, i've got no bounds
i was lost, now i'm found

bombay seems lost in dreams
when the pipes let off steam
in a backroom
somewhere, anywhere in l.a
next payday comes, i'll be gone
by boats and planes, it's pre arranged
you can't catch me, i'm on my way
back to bombay
bombay
ain't gonna leave no trace
gonna wash away my face
in the bombay river
i'm gonna settle
i'm gonna stay in bombay
i'm gonna trade my past
for a new life at last
sit back and have another blast
if i die, kamasutra's the reason why
kamasutra i surrender

i could bet on new years eve
he'd call me up at night
from the other side of the world
ed was always there alright
ed's got the looks of a movie star
ed's got the smile of a prince
he ride a bike instead of a car
i want to be his friend
dancing in the living room
with the ladies so nice
like a child with a wisdom tooth
he's just a friend of mine
ed's got the rings and the colors
ed's got the wind in his hair
he goes a riding with the brothers
he's got a fist in the air
going to the run, run angel
going to the run, run angel
well, heaven and hell came together that night
only for you this time
going to the run, forever angel
one summer at the festival
holding on real tight
on the back of a harley
he took me for a ride in the sky
ed's got the looks of a movie star
ed's got the smile of a prince
he'd ride a bike instead of a car
i'll always be his friend
going to the run, run angel

specialize in danger   i'm from niagara falls
and now i sit here waitin'
like an idiot for your call
words cannot explain
that rattlesnake in my bones
guess it's time to face the truth
i stand here licked by love
and in the name of love
i wanna go go go, like a burning stuntman  4x 
i fry exposed to fire of course
choke up while i'm breathin' smoke
come on quench the fire inside my soul
i wanna go go go
a slumbering volcano
about to explode
puttin' on a smile and then you're takin' of your clothes
words cannot explain
my heart's red pepper blue
and my blood goes boilin' every time i thing of you
i'm in danger how  bout you
i wanna go go go, like a burning stuntman  4x 
you fry exposed to fire of course
like a flame whisperin' to a moth
come on quench the fire inside my heart
i wanna go go go

in bad times, when it's dark and cold
you got no place to rest your soul
there's laughter behind your backs
then it seems the devil rules the deck
nothin' seems easy these days
or do i see it in a different way
the world is spinnin', well that's ok
tell me baby what's the price we pay
holy holy life, sometimes is lonely
holy holy life, sometimes is sad
holy holy life, sometimes is phoney
the sooner or later, they'll find you dead
why don't you take me down to a rabbit hole
where a man of peace can hide his soul
thinkin' about pollution and a birth control
better talk to the rabbits, it's somebodies fault
and maybe sometimes i'm pessimistic
and maybe it ain't so bad, it ain't so sick
i know i'm not the man of constant sorrow
and tell me is it the path of evil to follow
holy holy life, sometimes is lonely
holy holy life, sometimes is sad
holy holy life, sometimes is phoney
or sooner or later, they'll find you dead
holy holy life, sometimes is lonely
sometimes is phoney, sometimes is sad
holy holy life, sometimes is lonely
sometimes is phoney, sometimes is sad, so sad
holy holy life, sometimes is lonely
sometimes is phoney, sometimes is sad, so so sad

tony   my head's on a pillow
clock strikes it's the count of four
four hours of tossin' turnin'
in a big brass bed
i've tried all the tricks in the book now
but i just can't sleep no more
tony, what's happenin' to me
i'm tired i'm cold
somehow i'm imagining things
movin' in the shadow
and my face is a painting crying
in the heat of the sun
let the world outside   pay it's dues
i'll never know why   no matter how high
it's a sign that's been sealed delivered
tony, it's lookin' into your
quiet eyes   silent tears
silent as the night you deserted me
quiet eyes   silent tears
silence   the night lasted seven years
meanwhile i'm counting all the hours
i've counted all the days
on the pages of a calendar
i threw it all away
tony i'm tryin' to make some sense baby
i'm always tryin' to get through to you
maybe you're the last one to notice
how much i've been lovin' you
let the world outside   pay it's dues
i'll never know why   no matter how high
it's a sign that's been sealed delivered
tony, it's lookin' into your
quiet eyes   silent tears
silent as the night you deserted me
quiet eyes   silent tears
silent as the night you deserted me
quiet eyes   silent tears
silence   the night lasted seven years
quiet eyes   silent tears
silent as the night you deserted me
quiet eyes   silent tears
silence   the night lasted seven years
quiet eyes   silent tears
silent as the night you deserted me
quiet eyes   silent tears
silence   the night lasted seven years


when the going gets tough, the tough become an addict
buried down hard on a horrible line
demonic by the dawn, lead me to the attic
i don't wanna be dead, but i'm barely alive
so settle up mother, join the schizophrenic
it's a goddamn shame what you're doing to me
giving up ghosts, taking all the credit
another fine job, just abandon the dream

i can't decide whichever one is better
undefined, you've gotta spell it out
why am i continuing to wither?
i'm into it, i'm into it
i don't need information
i don't need irritation

underneath the fog is just another killer
reliable amalgam with a comical phase
where do i stop? god, i sound bitter
forget about the innocent and go to your cage
here we go again, a simple motherfucker
who is out of this world and into the kink
keep it in your pants, can i get an amen?
don't even bother cause they tell you what to think

decide whichever one is better
undefined, you've gotta spell it out
why am i continuing to wither?
i'm into it, i'm into it
i don't need information
i don't need irritation

just once i'd like to know
where the pain, the shame, and the spirit will go
looks like i'm here to stay
another bloody mess who's ready to be saved

decide whichever one is better
undefined, you've gotta spell it out

who's gonna save me?
who's gonna save me?
who's gonna save me?
who's gonna save me?


what do you dream
when the world is on fire
and you're drifting through time
in the space where you lie
calling to me
through the pain and desire
as the sun's taking flight
you awake to the light

eyes like pearls in the warmest sea
as deep as the ocean, as wide as the valley
all my troubles seem so far away from me
can't you see i was falling?
now my troubles seem far away from me

where do you go
when the sky hits the ground?
won't you take me away
to that innocent place

eyes like pearls in the warmest sea
as deep as the ocean, as wide as the valley
all my troubles seem so far away from me
can't you see i was falling?
now my troubles seem far away from me


eyes like pearls in the warmest sea

all my troubles seem so far away from me
can't you see i was falling?
now my troubles seem so far away

now my troubles seem far away from me

cue the light, watch this show
till you find the one you know
aaaah, eyes wide, skin aflame
all you were is wiped away
all you love has died today
you stand by
you stand by
you stand by
you stand by
and let it happen
all you were is wiped away
all you love has died today
all you were is wiped away
all you love has died today
run, you are a setting sun
night to night


how long, how long will i slide?
separate my side
i don t, i don t believe it s bad
slit my throat, it s all i ever

i heard your voice through a photograph
i thought it up it brought up the past
once you know you can never go back
i ve got to take it on the otherside
centuries are what it meant to me
a cemetery where i marry the sea
stranger things could never change my mind
i ve got to take it on the otherside
take it on the otherside
take it on
take it on

how long, how long will i slide?
separate my side
i don t, i don t believe it s bad
slit my throat, it s all i ever

pour my life into a paper cup
the ashtray's full and i m spillin' my guts
she wants to know am i still her slut
i ve got to take it on the otherside
a scarlet starlet and she s in my bed
a candidate for my soul mate bled
push the trigger and pull the thread
i ve got to take it on the otherside
take it on the otherside
take it on
take it on

how long, how long will i slide?
separate my side
i don t, i don t believe it s bad
slit my throat, it s all i ever

turn me on take me for a hard ride
burn me out leave me on the otherside
i yell and tell it that it s not my friend
i tear it down, i tear it down and then it s born again

how long, how long will i slide?
separate my side
i don t, i don t believe it s bad
slit my throat, it s all i ever
how long i don t, i don t believe it s sad
slit my throat, it s all i ever

one, two, three, four...
do you realize
that you have the most beautiful face?
do you realize
we're floating in space?
do you realize
that happiness makes you cry?
do you realize
that everyone you know someday will die?
and instead of saying all of your goodbyes, let them know
you realize that life goes fast
it's hard to make the good things last
you realize the sun doesn't go down
it's just an illusion caused by the world spinning 'round
do you realize? oh, oh, oh
do you realize
that everyone you know someday will die?
and instead of saying all of your goodbyes, let them know

and out of the red

down with me
slow how you wanted it to be
and over my head, out of her head she sang

and i wonder when i sing along with you

if everything could ever feel this real forever
if anything could ever be this good again
the only thing i'll ever ask of you
you've got to promise not to stop when i say when
she sang

breathe out, so i can breathe you in
hold you in
and now i know you've always been
and out of your head, out of my head i sang

and i wonder when i sing along with you

if everything could ever feel this real forever
if anything could ever be this good again
the only thing i'll ever ask of you
you've got to promise not to stop when i say when
she sang

once i was a wild dog
on the trail to a kill to feed my existence
that's where i first picked up the scent to her
wanted her for my own after the kill
the stag was ours, together we brought it down
and it was the first blood that we tasted together

we were wild dogs
wild dogs
wild dogs

we'd roll amongst the sweet grass lickin' on each other
as the night replaced the day we'd bay and howl at the moon
we'd lay down and we'd listen to the silence of the stars
shootin' 'cross the universe for us to see, her and me

we were wild dogs
wild dogs
wild dogs

we'd go runnin' through the forest with the grace of an eagle
with the freedom of the wind and the strength of our youth
just like our old friend the indian, we'd only kill to feed ourselves
or to protect those we loved from danger

we were wild dogs
wild dogs
we were wild dogs

i know a girl who thinks of ghosts

if you take a step towards me, you will take my breath away
so i'll keep you close and keep my secret safe
no one else has ever loved me, no one else has ever tried
i never understood how much i could take
then i saw the worst was over when i laid my eyes on you
it was all that i could do to know my place
out of all the past illusions, out of all the dreams come true
i was gone until i finally saw your face

if you cried out for more
if you reached out for me
i would run into the storm
just to keep you here with me
i have gone beyond my years
i've wasted half my life
but i found it all in you
did i save you? 'cause i know you saved me too

let me take a step towards you, let me feel you in my hands
let me cross this line and show you where it leads
there's a darkness down inside me that i know we'll both enjoy
and it's screaming from within to set it free
i have left this bloody nightmare in my wake but out of sight
all i want is deviation by design
out of all the past confusion, out of all the common spite
just tell me i am yours 'cause you are mine

and if you cried out for more
if you reached out for me
i would run into the storm
just to keep you here with me
i have gone beyond my years
i've wasted half my life
but i found it all in you
did i save you? 'cause i know you saved me too

it doesn't really matter what you do or say
i'm never going anywhere anyway
'cause when i'm dying for you, i've never felt so alive

if you cried out for more
if you reached out for me
i would run into the storm
just to keep you here with me
i have gone beyond my years
i've wasted half my life
but i found it all in you
did i save you? 'cause i know you saved me too

i'm just a passenger you've never seen before
inside a shell that's dying
 fading hatred 
what makes us do this?
we can't ignore
i can almost taste it
 all i see is war  

i never knew what you needed
i just know i'm wrong
i know its hard for you to believe
i'm gonna die  i'm gonna die   whole
 watch the hate you feed  
hold your own
 watch the hate you feed  


i never knew what you needed
i just know i'm wrong

einstein was not a handsome fellow
nobody ever called him al
he had a long mustache to pull on, it was yellow
i don't believe he ever had a girl
one thing he missed out in his theory
of time and space and relativity
is something that makes it very clear he
he was never gonna score like you and me
he didn't know about

quark, strangeness and charm
quark, strangeness and charm
quark, strangeness and charm
quark, strangeness and charm

i had a dangerous liaison
to be found out would've been a disgrace
we had to rendezvous some days on
the corner of an undiscovered place
we got sick of chat chat chatter
and the look upon everybody's face
but all that doesn't not anti matter now
we've found ourselves a black hole out in space
and we're talking about

copernicus had those renaissance ladies
crazy about his telescope
and galileo had a name that made his
reputation higher than his hopes
did none of these astronomers discover
while they were staring out into the dark
that what a lady looks for in her lover
is charm, strangeness and quark

it goes a 1, 2, 3
yeah, and it's just another bombtrack

and suckers be thinkin' that they can fake this
but, i'ma drop it at a higher level
'cause i'm inclined to stoop down, hand out some beat downs
could run a train on punk fools, that think they run the game
but i learned to burn that bridge, and delete
those who compete at a level that's obsolete
instead, i warm my hands upon the flames of the flag
to recall the downfall and the businesses that burnt us all
see through the news and the views, that twist reality
enough  i call the bluff, fuck manifest destiny
landlords and power whores on my people, they took turns
dispute the suits, i ignite, and then watch 'em burn

with the thoughts from a militant mind
hardline, hardline after hardline
landlords and power whores on my people, they took turns
dispute the suits, i ignite, and then watch 'em burn

burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn 
burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn

burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn 

it goes a 1, 2, 3   another funky, radical bombtrack
started as a sketch in my notebook
and now dope hooks make punks take another look
my thoughts ya hear and ya begin to fear
that ya card will get pulled if ya interfere

with the thoughts from a militant, militant mind
hardline, hardline after hardline
landlords and power whores on my people, they took turns
dispute the suits, i ignite, and then watch 'em burn

i'm home alone tonight
full moon illuminates my room
and sends my mind aflight
i think i was dreaming of some thoughts
that were seemingly possible with you

so i call you on the tin can phone
we rendezvous a quarter to
and make sure we're alone
i think i've found a way for you and i to finally fly
free

when we get there
we're gonna fly so far away
making sure to laugh
while we experience anti gravity
anti gravity
anti gravity

for years, i kept it to myself
now potentialities are bound
and living under my shelf
simply choose your destination from the diamond canopy
and we'll be there

so i call you on the tin can phone
we rendezvous a quarter two
and make sure we're alone
i think i've found a way for you and i to finally be
free

when we get there
we're gonna fly so far away
making sure to laugh
while we experience anti gravity
anti gravity
anti gravity

anti gravity
anti gravity
oh yeah


i took my love and i took it down
i climbed a mountain and i turned around
and i saw my reflection in the snow covered hills
till the landslide brought me down
oh, mirror in the sky
what is love?
can the child within my heart rise above?
can i sail through the changing ocean tides?
can i handle the seasons of my life?
hmmmm

well, i've been afraid of changing
'cause i've built my life around you
but time makes you bolder
even children get older
i'm getting older too

well, i've been afraid of changing
'cause i've built my life around you
but time makes you bolder
even children get older
and i'm getting older too
oh, i'm getting older too

i took my love, i took it down
oh if you climb a mountain and turned around
and if you see my reflection in the snow covered hills
well the landslide will bring you down
and if you see my reflection in the snow covered hills
well the landslide will bring you down
oh, the landslide will bring it down

and why did i try when i knew it was no and

 verse 1 
yeah we, we need to know where we're going

and how can i believe myself?
when i'm missing your body
saying your name

it's hard waking up with so much in my head


the means are right for taking, fade to grey
trying to be ruthless in the face of beauty
in this matrix it's plain to see
it's either you or me

bruise
pristine
serene
we were born to lose

cast a line with a velvet glove
reading like an open book, in the hands of love
in this matrix it's plain to see
it's either you or me

jessie is a friend
yeah, i know, he's been a good friend of mine
but lately something's changed that ain't hard to define
jessie's got himself a girl, and i wanna make her mine

and she's watching him with those eyes
and she's lovin' him with that body
i just know it
and he's holding her in his arms late, late at night

you know i wish that i had jessie's girl
i wish that i had jessie's girl
where can i find a woman like that?

i'll play along with this charade
that doesn't seem to be a reason to change
you know i feel so dirty when they start talking cute
i wanna tell her that i love her, but the point is probably moot

cause she's watching him with those eyes
and she's lovin' him with that body
i just know it
and he's holding her in his arms late, late at night

you know i wish that i had jessie's girl
i wish that i had jessie's girl
where can i find a woman like that?
like jessie's girl
i wish that i had jessie's girl
where can i find a woman...
where can i find a woman like that?

and i'm lookin' in the mirror all the time
wonderin' what she don't see in me
i've been funny; i've been cool with the lines
ain't that the way love's supposed to be?

tell me where can i find a woman like that?
you know i wish that i had jessie's girl
i wish that i had jessie's girl
i want jessie's girl
where can i find a woman like that?
like jessie's girl
i wish that i had jessie's girl

just a small town girl
living in a lonely world
she took the midnight train
going anywhere

just a city boy
born and raised in south detroit
he took the midnight train
going anywhere

a singer in a smoky room
a smell of wine and cheap perfume
for a smile they can share the night
it goes on and on and on and on

strangers waiting
up and down the boulevard
their shadows searching in the night
streetlights, people
living just to find emotion
hiding somewhere in the night

working hard to get my fill
everybody wants a thrill
payin' anything to roll the dice
just one more time

some will win, some will lose
some were born to sing the blues
oh, the movie never ends
it goes on and on and on and on

strangers waiting
up and down the boulevard
their shadows searching in the night
streetlights, people
living just to find emotion
hiding somewhere in the night


don't stop believin'
hold on to that feeling
streetlights, people
ohohohhhhhhhhhh
don't stop believin'
hold on
streetlights, people
ohohohhhhhhhhhh
don't stop believin'
hold on to that feeling
streetlights, people
ohohohhhhhhhhhh

coming on to the light of day we got
many moons that are deep at play so i
keep an eye on the shadow smile
to see what it has to say
you and i both know
everything must go away
what do you say?

spinning knot that is on my heart is like a
bit of light and a touch of dark you got
sneak attack from the zodiac
but i see your fire spark
eat the breeze and go
blow by blow and go away
what do you say?
yeah

you don't know my mind
you don't know my kind
dark necessities are part of my design and
tell the world that i'm
falling from the sky
dark necessities are part of my design

stumble down to the parking lot you got
no time for the afterthought they're like
ice cream for an astronaut
well that's me looking for we
turn the corner and

tell the world that i'm
falling from the sky
dark necessities are part of my design

do you want this love of mine?
darkness helps us all to shine
do you want it, do you want it now?
do you want it all the time?
but darkness helps us all to shine
do you want it, do you want it now?

pick you up like a paperback with the
track record of a maniac so i
move it in and we unpack
it's the same as yesterday
any way we roll
everything must go away
what do you say?
yeah

you don't know my mind
you don't know my kind
dark necessities are part of my design
tell the world that i'm
falling from the sky and
dark necessities are part of my design

ah ah ah

fast, on a rough road riding
high, through the mountains climbing
twisting, turning further from my home
young, like a new moon rising
fierce, through the rain and lightning
wandering out into this great unknown
and i don't want no one to cry
but, tell them if i don't survive

i was born free 
i was born free 
i was born free, born free

free, like a river raging
strong as the wind i m facing
chasing dreams and racing father time
deep like the grandest canyon
wild like an untamed stallion
if you can t see my heart you must be blind
you can knock me down and watch me bleed
but you can t keep no chains on me

i was born free 
i was born free 
i was born free, born free

and i'm not good at long goodbyes
but look down deep into my eyes
i was born free
calm, facing danger
lost, like an unknown stranger
grateful for my time with no regrets
close to my destination
tired, frail and aching
waiting patiently for the sun to set
and when it's done, believe that i
will yell it from that mountain high

i was born free 
i was born free 
i was born free, born free

i will bow to the shining sea
and celebrate god's grace on thee


when you can't find the light
that guides you through a cloudy day
when the stars ain't shining bright
you feel like you've lost you're way
when the candle light of home
burns so very far away
well, you got to let your soul shine
just like my daddy used to say

he used to say soulshine
it's better than sunshine
it's better than moonshine
damn sure better than rain
hey now people, don't mind
we all get this way sometime
got to let your soul shine, shine till the break of day

i grew up thinking that i had it made
gonna make it on my own
life can take the strongest man
make him feel so alone
now sometimes i feel a cold wind
blowing through my aching bones
i think back to what my daddy said
he said, "boy, there is darkness before the dawn"

let your soul shine
it's better than sunshine
it's better than moonshine
damn sure better than rain
yeah, now people don't mind
we all get this way sometimes
gotta let your soul shine, shine till the break of day

sometimes a man can feel this emptiness
like a woman has robbed him of his very soul
a woman too, god knows, she can feel like this
and when your world seems cold
you got to let your spirit take control

talking 'bout soulshine
it's better than sunshine
it's better than moonshine
damn sure better than rain
lord now people don't mind
we all get this way sometimes
gotta let your soul shine, shine till the break of day
oh, it's better than sunshine
it's better than moonshine
damn sure better than rain
yeah, now people don't mind
we all feel this way sometimes
gotta let your soul shine, shine till the break of day


gone walk down that dirt road,  til someone lets me ride
gone walk down that dirt road,  til someone lets me ride
if i can t find my baby, i m gonna run away and hide

i have been pacing around the room hoping maybe she d come back
pacing around the room hoping maybe she d come back
well, i have been praying for salvation laying  round in a one room country shack

gone walk down that dirt road until my eyes begin to bleed
gone walk down that dirt road until my eyes begin to bleed
 till there s nothing left to see,  tell the chains have been shattered
and i ve been freed

i been looking at my shadow, i have been watching the colors up above
looking at my shadow watching the colors up above
rolling through the rain and hail, looking for the sunny side of love

gone walk on down that dirt road  till i m right beside the sun
gone walk on down until i m right beside the sun
i m gonna have to put up a barrier to keep myself away from everyone

state of love and trust as i busted down the pretext
sin still plays and preaches, but to have an empty court, uh huh
and the signs are passin', grip the wheel, can't read it
sacrifice receiving the smell that's on my hands, hands, yeah
and i listen for the voice inside my head
nothin', i'll do this one myself
lay her down as priest does, should the lord be accountin'
will be in my honor, make it pain, painfully quick, uh huh
promises are whispered in the age of darkness
want to be enlightened like i want to be told the end, end, yeah
and the barrel shakes aimed a directly at my head
oh, help me, help me from myself
and i listen from both sides of a friend
nothin', i'll do this one myself
myself, myself
hey, na na na na, hey that's something
hey, na na na na, hey that's something
hey, na na na na, hey that's something
wanna back, back it away, yeah
and i listen, yeah, for the voice inside my head
nothin', i'll do this one myself
oh, ah, and the barrel waits, trigger shakes
aimed right at my head, won't you help me
help me from myself
state of love and trust, and a
state of love and trust, and a
state of love and trust, and a
state of love and yeah yeah


it's alright, there comes a time
got no patience to search for peace of mind
layin' low, want to take it slow
no more hiding or disguising truths i've sold

everyday it's something
hits me all so cold
find me sittin' by myself
no excuses, then i know

it's okay, had a bad day
hands are bruised from breaking rocks all day
drained and blue, i bleed for you
you think it's funny, well you're drowning in it too

everyday it's something
hits me all so cold
find me sittin' by myself
no excuses, then i know


yeah, it's fine, we'll walk down the line
leave our rain and cold; trade for warm sunshine
you, my friend, i will defend
and if we change, well, i'll love you anyway

everyday it's something
hits me all so cold
find me sittin' by myself
no excuses, then i know


waiting on a sunday afternoon
for what i've read between the lines
your lies
feeling like a hand in rusted shame
so do you laugh or does it cry
reply?

leaving on a southern train
only yesterday you lied
promises of what i seemed to be
only watched the time go by
all of these things you said to me

breathing is the hardest thing to do
with all i've said and all that's dead for
you
you lied
goodbye

leaving on a southern train
only yesterday you lied
promises of what i seemed to be
only watched the time go by
all of these things i said to you


did you hear the distant cry?
calling me back to my sins
like the ones you knew before
calling me back once again

i nearly
i nearly lost you there
and it's taken us somewhere
i nearly lost you there
well, let's try to sleep now

drag me far enough to know
i'm blind every mile that you burn
there's a rider that's fallen and
it's clear there's no time to return

i nearly
i nearly lost you there
and it's taken us somewhere
i nearly lost you there
well, let's try to sleep now

did you hear the distant lie?
calling me back to my sins
like the ones you knew before
calling me back once again

i nearly
i nearly lost you there
and it's taken us somewhere
i nearly lost you there
well, let's try to sleep now

i nearly lost you there, i nearly lost you
i nearly lost you there, i nearly lost you there
i nearly lost you there
oh yeah, i oh, i nearly lost you there


hey, hey, yeah, uh

sheets of empty canvas, untouched sheets of clay
were laid spread out before me as her body once did
all five horizons revolved around her soul
as the earth to the sun
now the air i tasted and breathed has taken a turn, ooh
and all i taught her was everything
ooh, i know she gave me all that she wore

and now my bitter hands chafe beneath the clouds
of what was everything
oh, the pictures have all been washed in black
tattooed everything

i take a walk outside
i'm surrounded by some kids at play
i can feel their laughter, so why do i sear
oh and twisted thoughts that spin round my head
i'm spinning, oh i'm spinning
how quick the sun can drop away

and now my bitter hands cradle broken glass
of what was everything
all the pictures have all been washed in black
tattooed everything

all the love gone bad turned my world to black
tattooed all i see, all that i am, all i'll be yeah
oh oh ooh

i know someday you'll have a beautiful life
i know you'll be a star in somebody else's sky, but why
why, why can't it be, why can't it be mine?
ooh why, ooh

doodoo doo doo doodoodoo, doodoo doo doo doodoodoo
doodoo doo doo doodoodoo, doodoo doo doo doodoodoo
doodoo doo doo doodoodoo, doodoo doo doo doodoodoo
doodoo doo doo doodoodoo, doodoo doo doo doodoodoo
doodoo doo doo doodoodoo, doodoo doo doo doodoodoo
doodoo doo doo doodoodoo, doodoo doo doo doodoodoo
doodoo doo doo doodoodoo, doodoo doo doo doodoodoo
doodoo doo doo doodoodoo, doodoo doo doo doodoodoo
doodoo doo doo doodoodoo, doodoo doo doo doodoodoo
doodoo doo doo doodoodoo, ooh ooh ooh
doodoo doo doo doodoodoo, ooh


light reflects from your shadow
it is more than i thought could exist
you move through the room
like breathing was easy
if someone believed me

they would be
as in love with you as i am
they would be
as in love with you as i am
they would be
as in love with you as i am
they would be
in love, love, love

and everyday
i am learning about you
the things that no one else sees
and the end comes too soon
like dreaming of angels
and leaving without them
and leaving without them

being
as in love with you as i am
being
as in love with you as i am
being
as in love with you as i am
being
as in love, love, love
love, love, love
love, love, love

and with words unspoken
a silent devotion
i know you know what i mean
and the end is unknown
but i think i'm ready
as long as you're with me

being
as in love with you as i am
being
as in love with you as i am
being
as in love with you as i am
being
as in love, love, love


just another microcosm somewhere in the ether
putting the world to rights with bing crosby eyes
oversharing and its bitter aftertaste
exactly the wrong time in exactly the wrong place
save it for a rainy day
baby, you go hard in the paint
it's just another race to anyways

philanthropic toga party
what a place for both the opposite sides of my double life to finally collide
sharing secrets i was taking to the grave
nosebleeds from epiphanies i took full in the face
oh, come all by the fire, babe, let s all participate
in yet another race to anyways
oh, how's your mum and dad been doing with the generation gap?

yeah, i'm behind my movie camera
i ve got my megaphone
you can call me alexander
it's nice to meet you all

listening to the shipping forecast
driving to the airport
me and the guys
metropolis ablaze in the rear view
devising methods to both have and eat your cake
mmm, just like the ones that mother nature used to bake
you look as if you know exactly what i'm gonna say
it's just another race to
anyways


i got up late again today
and i m scared of everything
i don t dare to dream
i got a dark imagination
these hours waste away
a debt i ll never pay
i m talking to the walls
but the walls keep caving in
they amplify my thoughts
i really want a conversation
but i let it slip away
a debt i ll never pay

worry, worry, oh
it s funny how it changes
when nothing really changes at all

am i jaded?

i m a loser, getting beat by my own game
but if i falter, well at least it was my mistake
oh, at least it was my mistake
 cause i choose to be this way
i m a loser, and i self deprecate
so when i falter, well at least it was my mistake

i saw my friend today
she tried to comfort me
but i turned her away
there's magic in this misery
so no matter what you say
i don t think i ll ever change

worry, worry, oh
it s funny how it changes
when nothing really changes at all

am i jaded?
am i meant to feel this way?
i m a loser, getting beat by my own game
but if i falter, well at least it was my mistake
well, at least it was my mistake
 cause i choose to be this way
i m a loser, and i self deprecate
so when i falter, well at least it was my mistake

and i don t really care about what anyone says
i don t give a damn about what anyone says
i don t want to think about anything
i don t want to think about anything
and i don t really care about what anyone says
i don t need opinions hanging over my head
i don t really care about anything
i don t really care
i don t really care at all

am i jaded?

 cause i choose to be this way
i m a loser, and i self deprecate
so when i falter, well at least it was my mistake

well, at least it was my mistake
well, at least it was my mistake

i was an unmarried girl
i'd just turned twenty seven
when they sent me to the sisters
for the way men looked at me
branded as a jezebel
i knew i was not bound for heaven
i'd be cast in shame
into the magdalene laundries
most girls come here pregnant
some by their own fathers
bridget got that belly
by her parish priest
we're trying to get things white as snow
all of us woe begotten daughters
in the streaming stains
of the magdalene laundries
prostitutes and destitutes
and temptresses like me  
fallen women  
sentenced into dreamless drudgery ...
why do they call this heartless place
our lady of charity?
oh charity 
these bloodless brides of jesus
if they had just once glimpsed their groom
then they'd know, and they'd drop the stones
concealed behind their rosaries
they wilt the grass they walk upon
they leech the light out of a room
they'd like to drive us down the drain
at the magdalene laundries
peg o'connell died today
she was a cheeky girl
a flirt
they just stuffed her in a hole 
surely to god you'd think at least some bells should ring 
one day i'm going to die here too
and they'll plant me in the dirt
like some lame bulb
that never blooms come any spring
not any spring
no, not any spring
not any spring


i must admit, i can't explain
any of these thoughts racin' through my brain, it's true
baby i'm howlin' for you

the actors here have not got a clue
baby i'm howlin' for you

pardon me while i burst
pardon me while i burst

a decade ago, i never thought i would be
at twenty three on the verge of spontaneous combustion
woe is me
but i guess that it comes with the territory
an ominous landscape of never ending calamity
i need you to hear, i need you to see
that i have had all that i can take
and exploding seems like a definite possibility
to me

so pardon me while i burst into flames
i've had enough of the world and its people's mindless games
so pardon me while i burn and rise above the flame
pardon me, pardon me... i'll never be the same

not two days ago, i was having a look
in a book and i saw a picture of a guy fried up above his knees
i said, "i can relate," because lately i've been
thinking of combustication as a welcomed vacation from
the burdens of the planet earth
like gravity, hypocrisy, and the perils of being in 3 d
and thinking so much differently

so pardon me while i burst into flames
i've had enough of the world and its people's mindless games
so pardon me while i burn and rise above the flame
pardon me, pardon me... i'll never be the same
never be the same, yeah
pardon me while i burst into flames
pardon me, pardon me, pardon me

so pardon me while i burst into flames
i've had enough of the world and its people's mindless games
so pardon me while i burn and rise above the flame
pardon me, pardon me... i'll never be the same
pardon me, never be the same, yeah

in many ways, they'll miss the good old days
someday, someday
yeah, it hurts to say, but i want you to stay
sometimes, sometimes
when we was young, oh man, did we have fun
always, always
promises, they break before they're made
sometimes, sometimes

oh, maya says i'm lacking in depth
i will do my best
you say you wanna stand by my side
darling, your head's not right
see, alone we stand, together we fall apart
yeah, i think i'll be alright
i'm working so i won't have to try so hard
tables, they turn sometimes, oh, someday
no, i ain't wasting no more time

 trying, trying 

and now my fears, they come to me in threes
so i sometimes
say, "fate, my friend, you say the strangest things i find
sometimes"

oh, maya says i'm lacking in depth
shit, i will try my best
you say you wanna stand by my side
darling, your head's not right
see, alone we stand, together we fall apart
yeah, i think i'll be alright
i'm working so i won't have to try so hard
tables, they turn sometimes, oh, someday
i ain't wasting no more time


it must be your skin, i'm sinking in
it must be for real cause now i can feel
and i didn't mind
it's not my kind, it's not my time to wonder why
everything gone white
everything's grey
now you're here, now you're away
i don't want this, remember that
i'll never forget where you're at

don't let the days go by
glycerine, glycerine

i'm never alone
i'm alone all the time
are you at one, or do you lie
we live in a wheel where everyone steals
but when we rise it's like strawberry fields
i treated you bad, you bruise my face
couldn't love you more you've got a beautiful taste

don't let the days go by
could've been easier on you
i couldn't change though i wanted to
it should have been easier by three
our old friend fear and you and me
glycerine, glycerine
don't let the days go by
glycerine
don't let the days go by....
glycerine, glycerine
glycerine, glycerine

bad moon white again
bad moon white again
as she falls around me

i needed you more, you wanted us less
i could not kiss, just regress
it might just be clear simple and plain
well that's just fine that's just one of my names

don't let the days go by
could've been easier on you, you, you
glycerine, glycerine
glycerine, glycerine


baby save it, we're wasted
i know we gotta slow it down
but when the waves come, you face them
and you know we can't stop it now

heads up, we're in a dead club
put your hands up and do your dipsy and dropsy

slip inside the eye of your mind
don't you know you might find
a better place to play?
you said that you'd never been
but all the things that you've seen
slowly fade away

so i start a revolution from my bed
'cause you said the brains i had went to my head
step outside, summertime's in bloom
stand up beside the fireplace
take that look from off your face
you ain't ever gonna burn my heart out

and so, sally can wait
she knows it's too late as we're walking on by
her soul slides away
but don't look back in anger
i heard you say

take me to the place where you go
where nobody knows if it's night or day
please don't put your life in the hands
of a rock 'n' roll band
who'll throw it all away

i'm gonna start a revolution from my bed

legs are tied, these hands are broken
alone i try with words unspoken
silent cry, my breath is frozen
with blinded eyes, i fear myself 

it's burning down, it's burning high
when ashes fall the legends rise
we burned it out oh my oh why ?
when ashes fall the legends rise  

my throat is dry, my vision's fading
i'm paralyzed and left here waiting
taking time just one step forward

when ashes fall the legends rise
we burned it out oh my oh why ?

when ashes fall the legends rise
we burned it out oh my oh why ?

lump sat alone in a boggy marsh
totally emotionless except for her heart
mud flowed up into lump's pajamas
she totally confused all the passing piranhas

she's lump, she's lump
she's in my head
she's lump, she's lump, she's lump
she might be dead

lump lingered last in line for brains
and the one she got was sorta rotten and insane
small things so sad that birds could land
is lump fast asleep or rockin' out with the band?


ba ba ba ba banana.  3x 
ba baw

lump was limp and lonely and needed a shove
lump slipped on a kiss and tumbled into love
she spent her twenties between the sheets
life limped along at sub sonic speeds

she's lump, she's lump
she's in my head
she's lump, she's lump, she's lump
she might be dead
woo 

is this lump outta my head?
i think so
is this lump outta my head?
i think so
is this lump outta my head?
i think so
is this lump outta my head?


summer nights and long warm days
are stolen as the old moon falls
my mirror shows another face
another place to hide it all
another place to hide it all

and i'm lost, behind
the words i'll never find
and i'm left behind
as seasons roll on by

sleeping with a full moon blanket
sand and feathers for my head
dreams have never been the answer
and dreams have never made my bed
dreams have never made my bed


now i want to fly above the storm
but you can't grow feathers in the rain
and the naked floor is cold as hell
this naked floor reminds me
oh the naked floor reminds me


if i should be short on words
and long on things to say
could you crawl into my world
and take me worlds away
should i be beside myself
and not even stay


alcoholic kind of mood
lose my clothes, lose my lube
cruising for a piece of fun
looking out for number one
different partner every night
so narcotic outta sight
what a gas, what a beautiful ass

and it all breaks down at the role reversal
got the muse in my head she's universal
spinning me round, she's coming over me
and it all breaks down at the first rehearsal
got the muse in my head she's universal
spinning me round, she's coming over me
kind of buzz that lasts for days
had some help from insect ways
comes across all shy and coy
just another nancy boy
woman man or modern monkey
just another happy junkie
fifty pounds press my button going down

and it all breaks down at the role reversal
got the muse in my head she's universal
spinning me round, she's coming over me
and it all breaks down at the first rehearsal
got the muse in my head she's universal
spinning me round, she's coming over me
does his makeup in his room
douse himself with cheap perfume
eyeholes in a paper bag
greatest lay i ever had
kind of guy who mates for life
gotta help him find a wife
we're a couple
when our bodies double

and it all breaks down at the role reversal
got the muse in my head she's universal
spinning me round, she's coming over me
and it all breaks down at the first rehearsal
got the muse in my head she's universal
spinning me round, she's coming over me


oh, pamela, what did you do?
you touched the ground and i fell in love with you
oh, pamela, what did they say?
i reached for your hand but you turned and walked away

and can you lend your ears to hear about my mate pamela
so naughty but she loves her fella
one wink and a glint in the other one
at night she only wears yves saint laurent
watches black and white movies to get thin
she curls her hair just like marilyn
oh, what an enigmatic woman
my gosh do some mothers have 'em

oh, pamela, what did you do?
you touched the ground and i fell in love with you
oh, pamela, what did they say?
i reached for your hand but you turned and walked away

and can you lend your ears for a man in trouble?
she tripped me up and now i see double
i asked her what her life was missing
and if she'd like to go trout mask kissing
she said, "go get high with the other ones"
i looked around, lights on but no one home
oh, what an enigmatic woman
my gosh do some mothers have 'em

oh, pamela, what did you do?
you touched the ground and i fell in love with you
oh, pamela, what did they say?
i reached for your hand but you turned and walked away
oh, pamela, what did you do?
you touched the ground and i fell in love with you
oh, pamela, what did they say?
i reached for your hand but you turned and walked away
walk away

na, na, na na, na
na, na, na na na na
na, na, na na, na
na, na, na na na na
take it away

earl grey and lemons in the morning
by noon her nurse comes calling
limousine with a stretcher in the back
they strap her down when she has a panic attack
god followed her down to the hospital
no visitors allowed on a bicycle
so i threw rocks up to the window
i cut the glass so she could feel the wind blow

oh, pamela, what did you do?
you touched the ground and i fell in love with you
oh, pamela, what did they say?
i reached for your hand but you turned and walked away
oh, pamela, what did you do?
you touched the ground and i fell in love with you
oh, pamela, what did they say?
i reached for your hand but you turned and walked away
you walk away
oh, pamela


i sat by the ocean
and drank a potion, baby, to erase you
face down in the boulevard
yet i couldn't face you
there ain t no use in crying
it doesn't change anything, so baby, what good does it do?
your friends, they all sympathize
maybe, i don t need them to

imagined i'd be your one and only
instead of the lonely one
you, me and a lie
silence is closer, we re passing ships in the night

there s nowhere to run away, said
"boy, if you want love, you ll have to go and find it with someone new
do you know who you really are?
are you sure it s really you?"
lies are a funny thing
they slip through your fingertips
because they never happened to you
time wounds all the heals as we fade out of view

imagined i'd be your one and only
instead of the lonely one
you, me and a lie
silence is closer, we re passing ships in the night
you, me and a lie
silence is closer, we re passing ships in the night
end to the night, left with nowhere to hide

closer and closer, we re crashing ships in the night

 the lord's prayer

tonight, there's going to be a fight
so if you need a place to go
got two room slum, a mattress and a gun
and the cops don't never show
so come right in because everybody sins
welcome to the scene of the crime
you want it? believe it? we got it if you need it
the devil is a friend of mine
if you think its crazy, you haven't seen a thing
just wait until we're going down in flames

we are, we are the saints, we signed our life away
doesn't matter what you think, were gonna do it anyway
we are, we are the saints, one day you will confess
and pray to the saints of los angeles

red line tripping on a land mine, sipping at the troubadour
girls passed out naked in the back lounge, everybody's going to score
she's all jacked up, she's down on her luck
you want it, you need it, the devils gonna feed it
don't you say, it's crazy, you don't know a thing
just wait until were going down in flames


give it up, give it up 


o, ain't that funny, things we do for love
things we do for passion, well i'm feelin' kind of rough
too many woman, too many games
a million faces and a million names
don't have much time, ain;t got the patience
to sit around and think about this hopeless situation
chorus:
i'm runnin' into the night, runnin', runnin'
i've got the power of the moonlight
still runnin', can't slow me down, runnin', runnin
follow my feelings till love comes around
my, my, my, my baby, you want to catch a falling star
you wanna catch a falling star
you wanta put it in your pocket, thinking maybe you'll go far
oh, but i won't be around to save you, when you take a fall from grace
i can't take all this madness, it's time to go
i'm in the race
too many cities, oh so bright
too many towns, all neon lights
i've got to ramble, i can't stay too long
i'm searchin' for the right one to keep me goin' strong
it happens over and over again, oh
another night is closin in
still a runnin', runnin' baby, i'm tryin' to find you
too many cities, oh so bright
too many towns, all neon lights
i've got to ramble, i can't stay too long
i'm searchin' for the right one
to keep me goin' strong


how in the world can i explain?
when the words leap off from the page
is there a way to celebrate?
when i'm scared straight from the past parades

the kids are throwing all their charms
at the latest token victory march
with no more trails to blaze

this is not connection
it's only an impression

how in the world can i compete?
when they're plugged into the new machines
laser focused on the screens
that will deliver them their self esteem

well, their ears all ring in monotone
with their bodies snug in memory foam
i can't help it
i wanna hear them scream

this is not connection
it's only an impression

plug on in, plug on in
plug on in, plug on in
plug on in, plug on in
plug on in, plug on in
plug on in

this is not connection
this is not affection
it's only an impression
this is not connection

oh, the weather's against us
houses underground
the flowers upside down
in our dreams
in the eye of the storm
the land where you were born
try to make no sound
we hide out
'cause they watch us in sleep
the language that we speak
and the secrets that we keep

in our dreams, in our dreams, in our dreams
in our dreams, in our dreams, in our dreams

i said i'm so sorry
to have kept you waiting around
i wish i could've come up

in the islands of the mind
the places they can't find
we'll hide out
and the black sky came down
and the cities underground
the flowers upside down
in our dreams
oh, to meet you again
to pass you on the stairs
to see you everywhere
in my dreams
'cause they watch us in sleep
and the language that we speak
and the secrets that we keep

to ourselves in our dreams, in our dreams
in our dreams, in our dreams, in our dreams

i saw the world today
it comes in green and gray
refrigerator hum
and chewing gum and instant karma
the war's a whore
and all the stores are bored with all your money
we follow what's to come
that's what they sold to me

now, now you're throwing the stone

somebody shut your eye
what will you say with that mind of your own?

waiting on the shelf  hold it steady 


in a few weeks, i will get time to realise
it's right before my eyes
and i can take it if it's what i want to do
i am leaving and this is starting to feel like
it's right before my eyes
and i can taste it, it's my sweet beginning

and i can tell just what you want
you don't want to be alone
you don't want to be alone
and i can't say it's what you know
but you've known it the whole time
yeah, you've known it the whole time

maybe next year, i'll have no time
to think about the questions to address
am i the one to try to stop the fire?
i wouldn't test you, i'm not the best you could have obtained
why try anything? i will get there
just remember, i know

and i can tell just what you want
you don't want to be alone
you don't want to be alone
and i can't say it's what you know
but you've known it the whole time
yeah, you've known it the whole time


and i can tell just what you want
you don't want to be alone
you don't want to be alone
and i can't say it's what you know
but you've known it the whole time
yeah, you've known it the whole time


you were a child
crawling on your knees toward it
making momma so proud
but your voice is too loud
we like to watch you laughing
you pick the insects off plants
no time to think of consequences

control yourself
take only what you need from it
a family of trees wanting
to be haunted
control yourself
take only what you need from it
a family of trees wanting
to be haunted

the water is warm
but it's sending me shivers
a baby is born
crying out for attention
the memories fade
like looking through a fogged mirror
decision to decisions are made
and not bought
but i thought this wouldn't hurt a lot
i guess not

control yourself
take only what you need from it
a family of trees wanting
to be haunted
control yourself
take only what you need from it
a family of trees wanting
to be haunted

control yourself
take only what you need from it

i run away like mercury
and i know you think it's rough
when you're trying to patch us up
and i say honey what is love?

i broke your heart so carelessly
i made the pieces part of me
and now it hurts what we've become
'cause you taught me how to love
it's me who taught you how to stop
and you just say i drink too much

maybe i'm defective
or maybe i'm dumb
i'm sorry, so sorry for what i've done
maybe i'm bad natured
or maybe i'm young
i'm sorry, so sorry for what i've done

looking out the door i see the rain fall upon the funeral mourners
parading in a wake of sad relations as their shoes fill up with water
maybe i'm too young to keep good love from going wrong
but tonight you're on my mind so you never know
broken down and hungry for your love with no way to feed it
where are you tonight, child you know how much i need it
too young to hold on and too old to just break free and run
sometimes a man gets carried away, when he feels like he should be having his fun
and much too blind to see the damage he's done
sometimes a man must awake to find that really, he has no one

so i'll wait for you and i'll burn
will i ever see your sweet return
oh will i ever learn

oh lover, you should've come over
cause it's not too late

lonely is the room, the bed is made, the open window lets the rain in
burning in the corner is the only one who dreams he had you with him
my body turns and yearns for a sleep that will never come
it's never over, my kingdom for a kiss upon her shoulder
it's never over, all my riches for her smiles when i slept so soft against her
it's never over, all my blood for the sweetness of her laughter
it's never over, she's the tear that hangs inside my soul
forever
well maybe i'm just too young
to keep good love from going wrong

oh... lover, you should've come over
cause it's not too late

well i feel too young to hold on
and i'm much too old to break free and run
too deaf, dumb, and blind to see the damage i've done
sweet lover, you should've come over
oh, love well i'm waiting for you

lover, lover, lover
lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover
lover, lover, lover you should've come over
cause it's not too late


i don't care if monday's blue
tuesday's grey and wednesday too
thursday i don't care about you

tuesday, wednesday heart attack
thursday never looking back
it's friday, i'm in love

monday you can hold your head
tuesday, wednesday stay in bed
or thursday watch the walls instead
it's friday, i'm in love

saturday, wait
and sunday always comes too late
but friday, never hesitate

dressed up to the eyes
it's a wonderful surprise
to see your shoes and your spirits rise
throwing out your frown
and just smiling at the sound
and as sleek as a shriek
spinning round and round
always take a big bite
it's such a gorgeous sight
to see you eat in the middle of the night
you can never get enough
enough of this stuff
it's friday i'm in love

i don't care if monday's blue
tuesday's grey and wednesday too
thursday i don't care about you
it's friday, i'm in love
monday you can fall apart
tuesday, wednesday break my heart
thursday doesn't even start
it's friday, i'm in love


just another microcosm somewhere in the ether
putting the world to rights with bing crosby eyes
oversharing and its bitter aftertaste
exactly the wrong time in exactly the wrong place
save it for a rainy day
baby, you go hard in the paint
it's just another race to anyways

philanthropic toga party
what a place for both the opposite sides of my double life to finally collide
sharing secrets i was taking to the grave
nosebleeds from epiphanies i took full in the face
oh, come all by the fire, babe, let s all participate
in yet another race to anyways

listening to the shipping forecast
driving to the airport
me and the guys
metropolis ablaze in the rear view
devising methods to both have and eat your cake
mmm, just like the ones that mother nature used to bake
you look as if you know exactly what i'm gonna say
it's just another race to
anyways


in a few weeks, i will get time to realise
it's right before my eyes

and i can taste it, it's my sweet beginning

and i can tell just what you want
you don't want to be alone
you don't want to be alone
and i can't say it's what you know
but you've known it the whole time
yeah, you've known it the whole time

maybe next year, i'll have no time
to think about the questions to address
am i the one to try to stop the fire?
i wouldn't test you, i'm not the best you could have obtained

the number in nations
the god in their hearts
the justice in swine
the devil in god
vote
this long hand that breaks our backs
still casting shadows on all that we see
unjustified...mercy killing is just a feeling
to keep our numbers from being free
 chorus 
prison for praise is not worth thinking
sin is still in and our ballots are shrinking
so unleash the dogs   the only solution
forgive and forget, fuck no
i'm talking about a revolution
the prophet man's got a needle in his hand
draws his dreams from your soul   bleeding
minds into sand
the year of the fear has arrived decades too late
and our right to stand and fight is now
solely sealed in fate
 repeat first chorus 
one last chance mission with a vision
'cos our lives are just cards in their stack
our time is short but theirs is shorter
how much longer can they hold us back
 chorus 
prison for praise   the obvious answer
once had power mad   living disaster
don't fuck with me 'cos i'm on a freedom train
that bears no name   this time
i'm voting with a bullet
this view they once knew made our nooses too tight
this justice in swine
this devil in god
so god bless my soul   i've got total control
and the crosshairs lined up dead in my sight
i'm voting with a bullet


honestly, somehow it always seems
that i'm dreamin' of somethin' i can never be
it doesn't matter to me
'cause i will always be that pimp that i see in all of my fantasies
i don't know your fuckin' name
so what? let's...
screamin' to be the only way
that i can truly be free from my fucked up reality
so i dream and stroke it harder
'cause it's so fun to see my face starin' back at me
i don't know your fuckin' name
so what? let's fuck 

all day, i dream about sex
all day, i dream about fuckin'

all day, i dream about fuckin'
all day, i dream about sex
yes, all day, i dream about sex
and all day, i dream about sex
yes, all day, i dream about sex
and all day, i dream about sex
yes, all day, i dream about sex
and all day, i dream about sex
yes, all day, i dream about sex

all day, i dream about sex
all day, i dream about fuckin'
all day, i dream about sex
all day, i dream about fuckin'


ow  haha, i meant, ah 
no, i didn't mean that at all
ooh, ooh, ooh

here in the streets so mechanized
rise to the bottom of the meaning of life
studied all the rules and didn't want no part
but i let you in just to break this heart
even though it was only one night
it was fucking strange

nina's in the bedroom, she said, "time to go now"
but leavin' it ain't easy, i got to let go, oh, i got to let go
and the hours they ran slow
i said, every night, she just can't stop saying

new york city cops, new york city cops
new york city cops, but they ain't too smart
new york city cops, new york city cops
new york city cops, but they ain't too smart

well, kill me now cause i let you down
i swear one day i'm gonna leave this town
stop  yes, i'm leaving, 'cause it just won't work
and they act like romans, but they dress like turks
some time in your prime
see me, i like the summertime but, hey

nina's in the bedroom, she said, "time to go now"
but leaving, it ain't easy, oh, i got to let go, oh, i got to let go, oh
trapped in an apartment, she would not let them get her
she wrote it in a letter, i got to come clean
the authorities they've seen, darling, i'm somewhere in between
i said, every night, she just can't stop saying

new york city cops, new york city cops
new york city cops, but they ain't too smart
new york city cops, new york city cops
new york city cops, but they ain't too smart


stay in the shadows
cheer at the gallows
this is a round up
this is a low flying panic attack
sing the song on the jukebox that goes

burn the witch
burn the witch
we know where you live

red crosses on wooden doors
if you float, you burn
loose talk around tables
abandon all reason
avoid all eye contact
do not react
shoot the messengers
this is a low flying panic attack
sing the song of sixpence that goes

burn the witch
burn the witch
we know where you live
we know where you live


it holds us like a phantom
it touches  like a breeze
it shines its understanding
see the moon is smiling
open on all channels
ready to receive
cause we're not at the mercy
of your chimeras and spells
your chimeras and spells
mmmhm
we are of the earth
to her we do return
the future is inside us
it's not somewhere else
it's not somewhere else
it's not somewhere else

 one day at a time 
one day at a time

we call upon the people
the people have this power
the numbers don't decide
the system is a lie
a river running dry
the wings of butterflies
and you may pour us away like soup
like we're pretty broken flowers
we'll take back what is ours
take back what is ours

one day at a time


this dance, this dance
is like a weapon, is like a weapon
of self defence, of self defence
against the present, against the present
the present tense
no, i won't get heavy, don't get heavy
keep it light and keep it moving
i am doing no harm
as my world comes crashing down
i'll be dancing, freaking out
deaf, dumb, and blind

in you, i'm lost
in you, i'm lost

i won't turn around or the penny drops
won't stop now, won't slack off
or all this love will be in vain
to stop from falling down a mine
it's no one's business but mine
where all this love has been in vain

in you, i'm lost
in you, i'm lost
in you, i'm lost
in you, i'm lost


a green plastic watering can
for a fake chinese rubber plant
in a fake plastic earth
that she bought from a rubber man
in a town full of rubber plans
to get rid of itself

it wears her out
it wears her out
it wears her out
it wears her out

she lives with a broken man
a cracked polystyrene man
who just crumbles and burns
he used to do surgery
for girls in the 80s
but gravity always wins

and it wears him out
it wears him out
it wears him out
it wears...

she looks like the real thing
she tastes like the real thing
my fake plastic love
but i can't help the feeling
i could blow through the ceiling
if i just turn and run

and it wears me out
it wears me out
it wears me out
it wears me out

and if i could be who you wanted
if i could be who you wanted
all the time
all the time


you bite through the big wall
the big wall bites back
you sit there and sulk
you sit there and bawl
you look so pretty
when you're on your knees
disinfected
and eager to please

sometimes you sulk
sometimes you burn
god rest your soul
when the loving comes but we're already gone
just like your dad, you'll never change

each time it comes
it eats me alive
i try to behave
but it eats me alive
so i declare a holiday
fall asleep, drift away

sometimes you sulk
sometimes you burn
god rest your soul
when the loving comes but we're already gone
just like your dad, you'll never change

sometimes you sulk
sometimes you burn
god rest your soul
when the loving comes but we're already gone
just like your dad, you'll never change


you are
the sun and moon
and stars are you
and i could never run away
from you

you try
at working out chaotic things
and why
should i believe myself, not you?

it's like
the world is going to end so soon
and why
should i believe myself?

you, me and everything
caught in the fire
i can see me drowning
caught in the fire
you, me and everything
caught in the fire
i can see me drowning
caught in the fire


i hear the drums echoing tonight
but she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
she's coming in, 12:30 flight
the moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation
i stopped an old man along the way
hoping to find some old forgotten words or ancient melodies
he turned to me as if to say
"hurry boy, it's waiting there for you"

it's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
there's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
i bless the rains down in africa
gonna take some time to do the things we never had

the wild dogs cry out in the night
as they grow restless longing for some solitary company
i know that i must do what's right
as sure as kilimanjaro rises like olympus above the serengeti
i seek to cure what's deep inside
frightened of this thing that i've become

it's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
there's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
i bless the rains down in africa
gonna take some time to do the things we never had

hurry boy, she's waiting there for you

it's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
there's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
i bless the rains down in africa
i bless the rains down in africa
i bless the rains down in africa
i bless the rains down in africa
i bless the rains down in africa
gonna take some time to do the things we never had

i been up, i been down
take my word, my way around
i ain't asking for much
i said, lord, take me downtown
i'm just looking for some tush
i been bad, i been good
dallas, texas, hollywood
i ain't asking for much
i said, lord, take me downtown
i'm just looking for some tush
take me back, way back home
not by myself, not alone
i ain't asking for much
i said, lord, take me downtown
i'm just looking for some tush


six bars laid across the sky
four empty walls to fill the time
one careless word, you lose your life
a grave new world awaits inside

lycanthropic survival instincts
embrace the beast and shun the weak
awake the primal one that sleeps inside
or feel the shiv er  running through your spine

the time is slipping by no peace in sight
but the teeth of time still hold their bite

my hands are painted red
my future's painted black
i can't recognize myself
i've become someone else
my hands are painted red
my hands are painted red

schizophrenic amnesia
bid goodbye to all you knew and loved
forget the only life that you knew outside
they bought the ticket, now you take the ride

the time is slipping by no peace in sight
but the teeth of time still hold their bite

my hands are painted red
my future's painted black
i can't recognize myself
i've become someone else
my hands are painted red
my hands are painted red

another number quickly learns the rules
a hidden burner waits to point at you
a subtle gesture and you're ventilated
talk isn't cheap here, bleed out in payment

six bars laid across the sky
four empty walls to fill the time

my hands are painted red
my future's painted black
i can't recognize myself
i've become someone else
my hands are painted red
my hands are painted red
my future's painted black
i can't recognize myself
i've become someone else
my hands are painted red
my hands are painted red

i feel i come from better conditions
buried deep in my mind i forgot
awake my soul
i want to find and drink this light
images of the past
other lives and other places
always the same embraces
i return to where i've been
i take inside a forward movement
involved in desire of consciousness
progress, understand
i want to find the keys of the past
remember the past, present, future
memory is a force
so many things have happened
to me the hardest of all
but the gates would never again
be opened to me unless
i could bid them open at my
own will and command
i feel i come from better conditions
 opened them at my own will and command 
buried deep in my mind i forgot
 opened them at my own will and command 
always the same light, same embraces
 opened them at my own will and command 
i take inside a forward movement

what?
well, let me roll up on to the sidewalk and take a look, yes
whoa  she's beautiful

and she looks wild, wild, wild, wild

and here's a little bit comin' your way, wow

yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
little bit, little bit, little bit higher
here's the national anthem, here
i wanna get a little bit a' apple pie, man
bright lights, city lights
bright lights, city lights
bright lights, city lights


i had seven faces
thought i knew which one to wear
but i'm sick of spending these lonely nights
training myself not to care
the subway is a porno
pavements, they are a mess
i know you've supported me for a long time
somehow, i'm not impressed

but new york cares  got to be some more change in my life 
new york cares  got to be some more change in my life 
new york cares  got to be some more change in my life 
new york cares  got to be some more change in my life 

subway, she is a porno
and the pavements they are a mess
i know you've supported me for a long time
somehow, i'm not impressed

it's up to me now, turn on the bright lights
oh, it's up to me now, turn on the bright lights

but new york cares  got to be some more change in my life 
new york cares  got to be some more change in my life 
new york cares  got to be some more change in my life 
new york cares  got to be some more change in my life 

it's up to me now, turn on the bright lights  got to be some more change in my life 
 got to be some more change in my life 
oh, it's up to me now, turn on the bright lights  got to be some more change in my life 
 got to be some more change in my life 


i, i wish i could swim
like dolphins, like dolphins could swim
though nothing will keep us together
we can beat them, for ever and ever

oh we can be heroes, just for one day
oh we can be heroes, just for one day

i, i will be king
and you, you will be queen
though nothing will drive us away

we can be heroes, just for one day
we can be us, just for one day

i, i can remember
standing, standing by the wall
and the guns, shot above our heads
and we kissed, as though nothing could fall
and the shame, the shame was on the other side
oh we can beat them, for ever and ever

and we could be heroes, just for one day


can't you see i'm easily bothered by persistence
one step from lashing out at you
you want in, to get under my skin and call yourself a friend
i've got more friends like you, what do i do

is there no standard anymore
what it takes, who i am, where i've been belong
you can't be something you're not
be yourself, by yourself
stay away from me
a lesson learned in life
known from the dawn of time

respect, walk, what did you say?
respect, walk, are you talking to me?
are you talking to me?

run your mouth when i'm not around, it's easy to achieve
you cry to weak friends that sympathize
can you hear the violins playing your song?
those same friends tell me your every word

is there no standard anymore
what it takes, who i am, where i've been belong
you can't be something you're not
be yourself, by yourself
stay away from me
a lesson learned in life
known from the dawn of time

respect, walk, what did you say
respect, walk, are you talking to me?
respect, walk, what did you say
respect, walk, are you talking to me?
are you talking to me?
no way, punk


respect, walk, what did you say
respect, walk, are you talking to me?
respect, walk, what did you say
respect, walk, are you talking to me?
are you talking to me?
walk on home, boy


under the lights where we stand tall
nobody touches us at all
showdown, shootout
spread fear within, without
we're gonna take what's ours to have
spread the word throughout the land
they say the bad guys wear black
we're tagged and can't turn back

you see us coming
and you all together run for cover
we're taking over this town

here we come, reach for your gun
and you better listen well my friend, you see
it's a pistol down below
aimed at you, we're the cowboys from hell
deed is done, again we've won
ain't talking no tall tales, friend
cause high noon, your doom
coming for you, we're the cowboys from hell

pillage the village, trash the scene
but better not take it out on me
cause a ghost town is found
where your city used to be
so out of the darkness and into the light
sparks fly everywhere in sight
from my double barrel, 12 gauge
can't lock me in your cage

you see us coming
and you all together run for cover
we're taking over this town

here we come, reach for your gun
and you better listen well my friend, you see
it's a pistol down below
aimed at you, we're the cowboys from hell
deed is done, again we've won
ain't talking no tall tales, friend
cause high noon, your doom
coming for you, we're the cowboys from hell
here we come, reach for your gun
and you better listen well my friend, you see
it's a pistol down below
aimed at you, we're the cowboys from hell
deed is done, again we've won
ain't talking no tall tales, friend
cause high noon, your doom
coming for you, we're the cowboys from hell
step aside for the cowboys from hell


the bloody angle, the symmetry
your cheap adhesive isn't holding me
my mouth is a gun i can shoot, i can show you the truth
and i don t need a reason to lie to you
no pun intended, no punishment
if i offended you, you needed it
ideas are the bombs in your mind, a fissure in time
if you don t have a weapon, you can t have mine

i can bleed if i want to bleed
i can fail if i feel the need
this face is my last confession
this life it feels like a prison

oh, i m not afraid
i m giving into grievances again
you re looking at an absolute zero
i m not the devil, but i won t be your hero

the catatonic, the sacrilege
your primadonnas are a privilege
my god has a need to react, it s as simple as that
it s better just to settle than face the facts

i can bleed if i want to bleed
i can fail if i feel the need
this face is my last confession
this life it feels like a prison

oh, i m not afraid
i m giving into grievances again
you re looking at an absolute zero
i m not the devil, but i won t be your hero

one thing that i can t stand
is when the minutes fight the second hand
i ll waste a lifetime's worth just to cling to one more day

no fucking quarter, no premiums
the world is stuck in delirium
man is a four letter word, it s really absurd
the hate isn't fake it s just inferred

oh, i m not afraid
i m giving into grievances again
i m down to absolute zero
another zealot with the weight of the fucking world
oh, i m not afraid
and i will let you down as i hold you in
you re looking at an absolute zero
i m not the devil, but i won t be your hero


i've felt the hate rise up in me
kneel down and clear the stone of leaves
i wander out where you can't see
inside my shell, i wait and bleed
i've felt the hate rise up in me
kneel down and clear the stone of leaves
i wander out where you can't see
inside my shell, i wait and bleed

goodbye 

i wipe it off on tile, the light is brighter this time
everything is 3d blasphemy
my eyes are red and gold, the hair is standing straight up
this is not the way i pictured me
i can't control my shakes, how the hell did i get here?
something about this, so very wrong
i have to laugh out loud, i wish i didn't like this
is it a dream or a memory?

i've felt the hate rise up in me
kneel down and clear the stone of leaves
i wander out where you can't see
inside my shell, i wait and bleed

get outta my head 'cause i don't need this
why didn't i see this?
but i'm a victim, manchurian candidate
i have sinned by just
making my mind up and taking your breath away

i've felt the hate rise up in me
kneel down and clear the stone of leaves
i wander out where you can't see
inside my shell, i wait and bleed
i've felt the hate rise up in me
kneel down and clear the stone of leaves
i wander out where you can't see
inside my shell, i wait and bleed

goodbye 

you haven't learned a thing
i haven't changed a thing
my flesh was in my bones
the pain was always free
you haven't learned a thing
i haven't changed a thing
my flesh was in my bones
the pain was always free

i've felt the hate rise up in me
kneel down and clear the stone of leaves
i wander out where you can't see
inside my shell, i wait and bleed
i've felt the hate rise up in me
kneel down and clear the stone of leaves
i wander out where you can't see
inside my shell, i wait and bleed

and it waits for you 


all wound up, on the edge, terrified
sleep disturbed, restless mind, petrified
bouts of fear permeate all i see
heightening nervousness threatens me
i am paralyzed
so afraid to die
caught off guard, warning signs never show
tension strikes, choking me, worries grow

why do i feel so numb?
is it something to do with where i come from?
should this be fight or flight?
i don't know why i'm constantly so uptight

rapid heartbeat pounding through my chest
agitated body in distress
i feel like i'm in danger
daily life is strangled by my stress
a stifling surge shooting through all my veins
extreme apprehension, suddenly i'm insane
lost all hope for redemption
a grave situation desperate at best

why do i feel so numb?
is it something to do with where i come from?
should this be fight or flight?
i don't know why i'm constantly reeling

helpless hysteria
a false sense of urgency
trapped in my phobia
possessed by anxiety
run, try to hide
overwhelmed by this complex delirium




helpless hysteria
a false sense of urgency
trapped in my phobia
possessed by anxiety
run, try to hide
overwhelmed by this complex delirium

if there was a single day i could live
a single breath i could take
i'd trade all the others away
the blood's on the wall, so you might as well just admit it
and bleach out the stains, commit to forgetting it
you're better off empty and blank, than left with a single pathetic trace of this
smother another failure, lay this to rest
console yourself, you're better alone
destroy yourself, see who gives a fuck
absorb yourself, you're better alone
destroy yourself
i'll chain you to the truth, for the truth shall set you free
i'll turn the screws of vengeance and bury you with honesty
i'll make all your dreams come to life, then slay them as quickly as they came
smother another failure, lay this to rest
console yourself, you're better alone
destroy yourself, see who gives a fuck
absorb yourself, you're better alone
destroy yourself
see who gives a fuck
see who gives a fuck
see who gives a fuck
failure 
if there was a day i could live
if there was a single breath i could take
i'd trade all the others away
i'd trade all the others away 


are you ready?

this place inside my mind
a place i like to hide
you don't know the chances
what if i should die?
a place inside my brain
another kind of pain
you don't know the chances
i'm so blind
blind
blind
another place i find
to escape the pain inside
you don't know the chances
what if i should die?
a place inside my brain
another kind of pain
you don't know the chances
i'm so blind
blind
blind

deeper, and deeper, and deeper
as i journey to live a life that seems to be
a lost reality
that can never find a way to reach my inner...
self esteem is low
how deep can i go
in the ground that i lay
if i don't find a way to
see through the gray that clouds my mind
this time i look to see what's between the lines
i can't see, i can't see, i'm going blind
i can't see, i can't see, i'm going blind
i can't see, i can't see, i'm going blind
i can't see, i can't see, i'm going blind

i can't see, i can't see, i'm going blind
i can't see, i can't see, i'm going blind
i can't see, i can't see, i'm going blind
i can't see, i can't see, i'm going blind
i can't see, i can't see, i'm going blind  i can see i'm going 
i can't see, i can't see, i'm going blind  going blind 
i can't see, i can't see, i'm going blind
i can't see, i can't see, i'm going blind 

i'm blind 
i'm blind 
i'm blind 
i'm blind 


do you feel like a chainstore?
practically floored
one of many zeros
kicked around, bored
your ears are full but you're empty
holding out your heart
to people who never really
care how you are

so give me coffee and tv, easily
i've seen so much, i'm going blind
and i'm braindead virtually
sociability, it's hard enough for me
take me away from this big, bad world
and agree to marry me
so we can start over again

do you go to the country?
it isn't very far
there's people there who will hurt you
because of who you are
your ears are full of the language
there's wisdom there, you're sure
until the words start slurring
and you can't find the door

so give me coffee and tv, easily
i've seen so much, i'm going blind
and i'm braindead virtually
sociability, it's hard enough for me
take me away from this big, bad world
and agree to marry me

all i hear is a scream
never say that to me 
never say that to me 
wait   wipe that shit off your face
let's don't stop till we bleed
the more you spit out your mouth, the less i believe

denial seems it had to come
relied on me to say it all
denial has left you all alone

i   can all that shit that you said
ever make any sense?
where did you run to   bitch  bitch 
while i was holding my breath?
what's sacred faded into nothing
never put that on me...
never put that on me...

denial seems it had to come
relied on me to say it all

 put your ladder down, put your ladder down
put your ladder down, put your ladder down 
don t be concerned
it s just the way that gravity works 'round here
all slowly rising, falling patiently
feel no, feel no fear
cirrus caress you, cumulus kiss you
raindrops of crystal whisper, "we ll miss you"
but go
let go

always and always and always ascending
the opening line leaves an uncertain ending
always and always and always ascending
the chords seem to pause, but ahh 

never gonna resolve  never going to resolve 
never gonna resolve  never going to resolve 
never gonna resolve  never going to resolve 
never gonna resolve  never going to resolve 
ah, talk to me  talk to me 
c'mon, talk to me  talk to me 
yeah, talk to me  talk to me 
ahh, oh
yeah, wake me up
c'mon wake me up

waking up dry, waking up dusty
feeling remorse, feeling thirsty
bring me a cup, bring me water
we can ascend from this arrangement
we can see fate as entertainment
bring me a cup, bring me water
bring me water

always and always and always ascending
the shepard misleads so you think you re transcending
always and always and always ascending
pause the progression, but ahh 

never gonna resolve  never going to resolve 
never gonna resolve  never going to resolve 
never gonna resolve  never going to resolve 
never gonna resolve  never going to resolve 
ah, talk to me  talk to me

run and tell all of the angels
this could take all night
think i need a devil to help me get things right
hook me up a new revolution
cause this one is a lie
we sat around laughing and watched the last one die

now i'm looking to the sky to save me
looking for a sign of life
looking for something to help me burn out bright
i'm looking for a complication
looking cause i'm tired of lying
make my way back home when i learn to fly high

i think i'm done nursing the patience
it can wait one night
i'd give it all away if you give me one last try
we'll live happily ever trapped if you just save my life
run and tell the angels that everything's alright

now i'm looking to the sky to save me
looking for a sign of life
looking for something to help me burn out bright
i'm looking for a complication

fly along with me, i can't quite make it alone
try to make this life my own

i jump from thought to thought like a flea jumps to a light
you could give an aspirin the headache of its life
maybe it's the crazy that i'd miss
watering plastic plants in the hope that they'll grow
seeing a message flash and then smashing up my phone
maybe it's the crazy that i'd miss
it won't get better than this

i like the way your brain works, i like the way you try
to run with the wolf pack when your legs are tied
i like the way you turn me inside and out
i like the way you turn
 woo, ooh ooh, ooh ooh
ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh 
i like the way your brain works
 woo, ooh ooh, ooh ooh
ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh 
i like the way your brain works

i want to get college girl drunk tonight
no morning fears, no mountains to climb
they say the best memories are the ones that we forget
like listening to drake at your best friend's swimming pool
floating anti clockwise in a red mushroom
maybe it's the crazy that i'd miss
it won't get better than this

i like the way your brain works, i like the way you try
to run with the wolf pack when your legs are tied
i like the way you turn me inside and out

baby, it's the crazy i like
i think i saw the world turn in your eyes
baby, it's the crazy i like  ah ah, ah 
and maybe it's the bullshit i'd miss
screaming at the moon in black lipstick
maybe it's the bullshit i'd miss
it won't get better than this


hero to zero
i pick up the bill
the brake lights cast a red light
and the road twists round the hill
lipstick on the backseat
saliva on the dash
i've clawed my way out of here before
but i keep on coming back

i push and you tend to shove
i give in and you don't give up
i'm not getting out of here this time
i brought a lemon to a knife fight
i kick and you like to punch
i'm unhinged and you're undone
i'm not getting out of here alive
i brought a lemon to a knife fight
i brought a lemon to a knife fight

hero to zero at 60mph
my eyes are getting wider with every word you say
intoxicated, higher than the iss
i've clawed my way out of here before
but tonight i'm turning left

i push and you tend to shove
i give in and you don't give up
i'm not getting out of here this time
i brought a lemon to a knife fight
i kick and you like to punch
i'm unhinged and you're undone
i'm not getting out of here alive
i brought a lemon to a knife fight
i brought a lemon to a knife fight

hey, hey, hey, hey
ooh...

won't you come see about me?
i'll be alone, dancing you know it baby
tell me your troubles and doubts
giving me everything inside and out and
love's strange so real in the dark
think of the tender things that we were working on
slow change may pull us apart
when the light gets into your heart, baby

don't you forget about me
don't, don't, don't, don't
don't you forget about me

will you stand above me?
look my way, never love me
rain keeps falling, rain keeps falling
down, down, down
will you recognize me?
call my name or walk on by
rain keeps falling, rain keeps falling
down, down, down, down
hey, hey, hey, hey
ohhhh.....

don't you try to pretend
it's my feeling we'll win in the end
i won't harm you or touch your defenses
vanity and security
don't you forget about me
i'll be alone, dancing you know it baby
going to take you apart
i'll put us back together at heart, baby

don't you forget about me
don't, don't, don't, don't
don't you forget about me

as you walk on by
will you call my name?
as you walk on by
will you call my name?
when you walk away
or will you walk away?
will you walk on by?
come on   call my name
will you call my name?

i say
la la la...
when you walk on by
la la la...

have you noticed? i've never been impressed
by your friends from new york and london
i'll level accusations like the press
'til you realise that you've dressed yourself in tatters
because a man's needs, man's needs
are found on greed, are found on greed
a man's needs, man's needs
are lost on me
a man's needs, man's needs
are found on greed, are found on greed
a man's needs
i'm not bothered, what you say or how you dress
i'm a mess, so you've always seemed inviting
but really, this all seems quite meaningless
and i remember that you never seem to see...
the fact that man's needs, man's needs
are found on greed, are found on greed
a man's needs, man's needs
are lost on me
a girl's needs, girl's needs
just don't agree, just don't agree
with a man's needs
have you noticed? i've never been impressed
by your friends from new york and london
but really, this all seems quite meaningless
when i remember that you never seem to see...
the excuse that man's needs, man's needs
are found on greed, are found on greed
a man's needs, man's needs
are lost on me
you say a man's needs, man's needs
apply to me, i don't agree
a man's needs...

patrick, you see, i'm growing a mustache
and though i know i must ask you
does it really make me look like a man?
spongebob, being a man is just a tough job
i hope you're picked to be the best spongebobs ever had
working like a dog at the krusty krab
now wait a minute
i think we hit a wall
i think we hit a psychic wall
maybe we're just young and we won't know 'til we're old
too young to free ourselves from this lonely fish bowl
some kind of wall
some kind of psychic wall
some kind of wall
some kind of psychic wall
we can get a burn
come on, let's find a way to be happy
not like plankton, he will never be satisfied
always complaining about his life
to his computer wife
you think he would've found by now
to be thought of as a king
you don't need a crown

waiting for your call, baby, night and day
i'm fed up, i'm tired of waiting on you

no time to hesitate
those who run seem to have all the fun

the lights are on, but there's no one home
tick tick tock, it's a quarter to two
and i'm done
i'm hanging up on you
i can't keep on waiting for you
i know that you're still hesitating
don't cry for me, 'cause i'll find my way
you'll wake up one day
but it'll be too late

every little thing that you say or do

and it's been awhile since i could hold my head up high
and it's been awhile since i first saw you
and it's been awhile since i could stand on my own two feet again
and it's been awhile since i could call you

and everything i can't remember
as fucked up as it all may seem
the consequences that are rendered
i've stretched myself beyond my means

and it's been awhile since i can say that i wasn't addicted
and it's been awhile since i can say i love myself as well and
and it's been awhile since i've gone and fucked things up just like i always do
and it's been a while, but all that shit seems to disappear when i'm with you

and everything i can't remember
as fucked up as it all may seem
the consequences that i've rendered
i've gone and fucked things up again, again

why must i feel this way?
just make this go away
just one more peaceful day

and it's been awhile since i could look at myself straight
and it's been awhile since i said i'm sorry
and it's been awhile since i've seen the way the candles light your face
and it's been awhile, but i can still remember just the way you taste

and everything i can't remember
as fucked up as it all may seem to be, and i know it's me
i cannot blame this on my father
he did the best he could for me

and it's been awhile since i could hold my head up high
and it's been awhile since i said i'm sorry


we're leaving together
but still it's farewell
and maybe we'll come back
to earth, who can tell?
i guess there is no one to blame
we're leaving ground  leaving ground 
will things ever be the same again?

it's the final countdown
the final countdown
ohh

we're heading for venus  venus 
and still we stand tall
cause maybe they've seen us
and welcome us, all yeah
with so many lightyears to go
and things to be found  to be found 
i'm sure that we'll all miss her so

it's the final countdown
the final countdown
the final countdown  final countdown 
the final countdown

j  saindo, indo embora
louco por voc   pequena 
que pena 
que desperd cio 


today is gonna be the day that they're gonna throw it back to you
by now, you should have somehow realised what you gotta do
i don't believe that anybody feels the way i do, about you now

backbeat, the word is on the street that the fire in your heart is out
i'm sure you've heard it all before but you never really had a doubt
i don't believe that anybody feels the way i do, about you now

and all the roads we have to walk are winding
and all the lights that lead us there are blinding
there are many things that i would like to say to you
but i don't know how

because maybe
you're gonna be the one that saves me
and after all
you're my wonderwall

today was gonna be the day but they'll never throw it back to you
by now you should've somehow realised what you're not to do
i don't believe that anybody feels the way i do, about you now

and all the lights that light the way are blinding
there are many things that i would like to say to you

i will find a way
to get to you someday
oh but i, babe, i'm so afraid i'll fall
yeah, now can't you hear me call

shake some action's what i need
to let me bust out at full speed
and i'm sure that's all you'll need
to make it alright

it's taken me so long
to get where i belong
oh, but lord please don't send me back that way
or i will make you pay


if you don't dig what i say
then i will go away
and i won't come this way again
cuz i don't need a friend



after the glow, the scene, the stage, the set
talk becomes slow, but there's one thing i'll never forget
hey, you gotta pay your dues before you pay the rent
over the turnstiles and out in the traffic
there's ways of living; it's the way i'm living
right or wrong, it's all that i can do and i wouldn't wanna let you be

i want a range life
if i could settle down
if i could settle down
then i would settle down
i want a range life
if i could settle down
if i could settle down
then i would settle down

run from the pigs, the fuzz, the cops, the heat
pass me your gloves, this crime, it is never complete
until you snort it up and shoot it down, you're never gonna feel free
out on my skateboard, the night is just humming
and the gums smacks are the pulse i'll follow if my walkman fades
but i've got absolutely no one, no one but myself to blame

but don't worry, we're in no hurry
school's out, what did you expect?

i want a range life
if i could settle down
if i could settle down
then i would settle down
i want a range life
if i could settle down
if i could settle down
then i would settle down

out on tour with the smashing pumpkins
nature kids, i, they don't have no function
i don't understand what they mean and i could really give a fuck
the stone temple pilots, they're elegant bachelors
they're foxy to me, are they foxy to you?
i will agree they deserve absolutely nothing, nothing more than me

dreamin', dream dream dream dream dream


when you were here before
couldn't look you in the eye
you're just like an angel
your skin makes me cry
you float like a feather
in a beautiful world
i wish i was special
you're so fuckin' special

but i'm a creep
i'm a weirdo
what the hell am i doing here?
i don't belong here

i don't care if it hurts
i wanna have control
i want a perfect body
i want a perfect soul
i want you to notice
when i'm not around
you're so fuckin' special
i wish i was special

but i'm a creep
i'm a weirdo
what the hell am i doing here?
i don't belong here

she's running out the door
she's running out
she run, run, run, run

whatever makes you happy
whatever you want
you're so fuckin' special
i wish i was special
but i'm a creep
i'm a weirdo
what the hell am i doing here?
i don't belong here

flying on your motorcycle
watching all the ground beneath you drop
you'd kill yourself for recognition
kill yourself to never, ever stop
you broke another mirror
you're turning into something you are not

don't leave me high
don't leave me dry
don't leave me high
don't leave me dry

drying up in conversation
you will be the one who cannot talk
all your insides fall to pieces
you just sit there wishing you could still make love
they're the ones who'll hate you
when you think you've got the world all sussed out
they're the ones who'll spit at you
you will be the one screaming out

don't leave me high
don't leave me dry
don't leave me high
don't leave me dry

oh, it's the best thing that you've ever had
the best thing that you've ever, ever had
it's the best thing that you've ever had
the best thing you've had has gone away

so don't leave me high
don't leave me dry
don't leave me high
don't leave me dry
don't leave me high
don't leave me high
don't leave me dry


i ll drown my beliefs
to have your babies
i ll dress like your niece
and wash your swollen feet

just don t leave
don t leave

i m not living
i m just killing time
your tiny hands
your crazy kitten smile

just don t leave
don t leave

and true love waits
in haunted attics
and true love lives
on lollipops and crisps

just don t leave
don t leave


where do we go from here?
the words are coming out all weird
where are you now when i need you?
alone on an airplane
falling asleep against the windowpane
my blood will thicken

i need to wash myself again
to hide all the dirt and pain
cause i'd be scared that there's nothing underneath
but who are my real friends?
have they all got the bends?
am i really sinking this low?

my baby's got the bends, oh no
we don't have any real friends
no, no, no

just lying in the bar with my drip feed on
talking to my girlfriend, waiting for something to happen
i wish it was the '60s, i wish i could be happy
i wish, i wish, i wish that something would happen

where do we go from here?
the planet is a gunboat in a sea of fear
and where are you?
they brought in the cia
the tanks and the whole marines
to blow me away
to blow me sky high

my baby's got the bends
we don't have any real friends

just lying in the bar with my drip feed on
talking to my girlfriend, waiting for something to happen
i wish it was the '60s, i wish i could be happy
i wish, i wish, i wish that something would happen

i wanna live, breathe
i wanna be a part of the human race
i wanna live, breathe
i wanna be a part of the human race
race, race, race

where do we go from here?
the words are coming out all weird
where are you now when i need you?


i never wanted anything but this
i worked hard, tried hard
i ran around in domestic bliss
i fought hard, died long

every time you're running out of here
every time you're running i get the fear

i never wanted any broken bones
scarred face, no home
your words surround me and asphyxiate
and i burn all hate

every time you're running out on me
every time you're running i can see

i'm not a vegetable
i will not control myself
i spit on the hand that feeds me
i will not control myself

the waters spray, the waters run all over me
the waters spray, the waters run
and this time you're gonna pay

i'm not a vegetable
i will not control myself
i spit on the hand that feeds me
i will not control myself

when there's lightning
you know it always brings me down
cause it's free and i see that it's me
who's lost and never found
i cry out for magic
i feel it dancing in the light
it was cold, lost my hold
to the shadows of the night
no sign of the morning coming
you've been left on your own
like a rainbow in the dark
a rainbow in the dark
do your demons, do they ever let you go?
when you've tried, do they hide deep inside?
is it someone that you know?
you're just a picture
you're an image caught in time
we're a lie, you and i
we're words without a rhyme
there's no sign of the morning coming
you've been left on your own
like a rainbow in the dark
just a rainbow in the dark
when i see lightning
you know it always brings me down
cause it's free and i see that it's me
who's lost and never found
feel the magic
i feel it floating in the air
but it's fear and you'll hear it calling
you beware, look out
there's no sign of the morning coming
there's no sign of the day
you've been left on your own
like a rainbow, like a rainbow in the dark
you're a rainbow in the dark
just a rainbow in the dark
no sign of the morning
you're a rainbow in the dark
whoahoohwhoaoohwhoaohhhhh

she caught the melting sky
it burned but still the winter passes by and by
to the other side
a slow parade of wind that blows through trees that wilted
with the season's children
are we saved by the words of bastard saints?
do we live in fear or faith?
tell me now, who's behind the rain?
a maze of tangled grace
the symptoms of "for real" are crumbling from embrace
but still we chase...
the shadows of belief
a new religion clouds our visions of the roots of our souls
are we ashamed of our own fate?
or play the fool for our own sake?
tell me who's behind the rain?
what do we need?
where do we go when we get where we don't know?
why should we doubt the virgin white of fallen snow
when faith's our shelter from the cold?
what do we need?
where do we go when we get where we don't know?
why should we doubt the virgin white of fallen snow
when faith's our shelter from the cold?

back to the frontlines... back to the night
medieval marauders... under the lights
back for the plunder... the thrill of the flames
the roar of the thunder... back in the game
storming the castles... swords in the air
killing the monsters in their own lair
lighting the torches... setting the stage
you get what you ask for... right in the face
six string sabres... screams in the night
war clubs pounding... living just for the fight

so we drive... through the night
with the howling wind at our backs
riding on teutonic terror
we will... give em' the axe
we will... give em' the axe
string up the razors... sharpen the blades
tighten the skins up... no one escapes
crank up the grindstone... load up the sleds
saddle the horses... off with their heads 
six string sabres... screams in the night
war clubs pounding... living just for the fight

so we drive... through the night
with the howling wind at our backs
riding on teutonic terror
we will... give em' the axe
we will... give em' the axe
for the roar... of the crowd
for the raging frontal attack
delivering the teutonic terror
we will... give em' the axe
we will... give em' the axe

so we drive... through the night
with the howling wind at our backs

coiled forever in the darkness below
they await for the right time to strike
defending the truth and protecting the lies
reptilian, shedding their skin
they gather in masses, encrypting the stars
to breed slaves sworn to war
the thrashing and bashing and blistering burns
death brought forth to the world

serpent's eyes
always watching you
without a trace
the covenant of the snake
succumbing unto your fate
they've been watching you
through shape shift eyes
in sumerian disguise
by the gods who decree our faith
by the gods who decree our faith
de luvium religions of monarchs and gods
the hideous hydra takes shape
the bloodline descendants of its original form
the dragon of egypt awakes
they've taken the tablets and hidden the scrolls
to deceive the ones they protect
the truth of creation, mutation of man
entombed in the vatican walls

serpent's eyes
always watching you
without a trace

a man walks down the street
he says, "why am i soft in the middle, now?
why am i soft in the middle?
the rest of my life is so hard
i need a photo opportunity
i want a shot at redemption
don't want to end up a cartoon
in a cartoon graveyard"
bonedigger, bonedigger
dogs in the moonlight
far away in my well lit door
mr. beerbelly, beerbelly

a man walks down the street
he says, "why am i short of attention?
got a short little span of attention
and, whoa, my nights are so long
where's my wife and family?
what if i die here?
who'll be my role model
now that my role model is gone, gone?"
he ducked back down the alley
with some roly poly little bat faced girl
all along, along
there were incidents and accidents
there were hints and allegations

if you'll be my bodyguard
i can be your long lost pal
i can call you betty
and betty, when you call me, you can call me al
call me al


a man walks down the street
it's a street in a strange world
maybe it's the third world
maybe it's his first time around
doesn't speak the language
he holds no currency
he is a foreign man
he is surrounded by the sound, the sound
cattle in the marketplace
scatterings and orphanages
he looks around, around
he sees angels in the architecture
spinning in infinity
he says, "amen and hallelujah "

if you'll be my bodyguard
i can be your long lost pal
i can call you betty
and betty, when you call me, you can call me al
call me

asked me to listen

maculate, there is no cure
playing over, stop pretending
warped inside its never ending tide

don't leave me now, don't leave me now

there's a patch of longing at the edge of town
don't run so fast 'cause my heels get caught
an american tourist he says he wanted some rock
i could've just flipped the sign, charged him anything, taken everything he's got
i saw a little sign up in the sky
reminded me of something in your eye
that's brighton pier, darling
where the lights
they sing a sad, sad song
they sing a dirty old song
but we carry on
across the wooden boards and then far out to sea
i never even realized you were seeing the same thing as me
i'm cutting up on swinton street with my head held high
i kiss her on the lips and sometimes it's hard to say goodbye
where the lights
they sing a sad, sad song
sing a dirty old song
but we carry on
where the lights
they sing a sad, sad song
sing a dirty old song
but we carry on
 you're such a...  
they sing a sad, sad song
they sing a dirty old song
but we carry on
where the lights
they sing a sad, sad song
they sing a dirty old song
but we carry on
 where the lights  i knew it was a question, but i
 sad, sad song  didn't know the answer so i
 a dirty old song  just looked away away and i
 carry on  kind of looked the other way and that's
 where the lights  over to the sea and that's
 sad, sad song  far from you and me
 sad, sad song  where the lights
i said we carry on

cutting with the knife
blood is spilling everywhere
she will be my wife
secondary spine, incisions must be accurate
i know just what to do
my hands are trembling
i can't spare to slip up with this knife
her beauty so illogical
the beast come gliding in
hideous chameleon stripped down to her skin
dance to the burning flame
pleasure exhumes the pain
the night bursts into flames
dance helena dance
if i cut off your arms and i cut off your legs
would you still love me anyway?
there's a spot on the floor where your limbs used to be
and i close the door on my fantasies
why don't you love me anyway?
why don't you love me anyway?
why don't you love me anyway?
why don't you love me anyway?

don't you know you might find
a better place to play?
you said that you'd never been
but all the things that you've seen
slowly fade away

so i start a revolution from my bed
'cause you said the brains i had went to my head
step outside, summertime's in bloom
stand up beside the fireplace
take that look from off your face
you ain't ever gonna burn my heart out

and so, sally can wait
she knows it's too late as we're walking on by
her soul slides away
but don't look back in anger
i heard you say

take me to the place where you go
where nobody knows if it's night or day
please don't put your life in the hands
of a rock 'n' roll band
who'll throw it all away

rows and flows of angel hair
and ice cream castles in the air
and feather canyons everywhere
i've looked at clouds that way
but now they only block the sun
they rain and they snow on everyone
so many things i would have done
but clouds got in my way

i've looked at clouds from both sides now
from up and down, and still somehow
it's cloud illusions i recall
i really don't know clouds at all

moons and junes and ferris wheels
the dizzy dancing way that you feel
as every fairy tale comes real
i've looked at love that way
but now it's just another show
and you leave 'em laughing when you go
and if you care, don't let them know
don't give yourself away

i've looked at love from both sides now
from give and take, and still somehow
it's love's illusions that i recall
i really don't know love
i really don t know love at all

tears and fears and feeling proud
to say "i love you" right out loud
dreams and schemes and circus crowds
i've looked at life that way
oh, but now old friends they re acting strange
and they shake their heads, and they tell me that i've changed
well something's lost but something's gained
in living every day

i've looked at life from both sides now
from win and lose and still somehow
it's life's illusions i recall
i really don't know life
at all

it's life's illusions that i recall
i really don't know life
i really don t know life at all

it's early morning, the sun comes out
last night was shaking and pretty loud
my cat is purring, it scratches my skin
so what is wrong with another sin?
the bitch is hungry, she needs to tell
so give her inches and feed her well
more days to come, new places to go
i've got to leave, it's time for a show

here i am
rock you like a hurricane
here i am
rock you like a hurricane

my body is burning, it starts to shout
desire is coming, it breaks out loud
lust is in cages 'til storm breaks loose
just have to make it with someone i choose
the night is calling, i have to go
the wolf is hungry, he runs the show
he's licking his lips, he's ready to win
on the hunt tonight for love at first sting

here i am
rock you like a hurricane

oh i can't fight this feeling any longer
and yet i'm still afraid to let it flow
what started out as friendship, has grown stronger
i only wish i had the strength to let it show
i tell myself that i can't hold out forever
i said there is no reason for my fear
cause i feel so secure when we're together
you give my life direction
you make everything so clear

and even as i wander
i'm keeping you in sight
you're a candle in the window
on a cold, dark winter's night
and i'm getting closer than i ever thought i might

and i can't fight this feeling anymore
i've forgotten what i started fighting for
it's time to bring this ship into the shore
and throw away the oars, forever
cause i can't fight this feeling anymore
i've forgotten what i started fighting for
and if i have to crawl upon the floor
come crashing through your door
baby, i can't fight this feeling anymore

my life has been such a whirlwind since i saw you
i've been running round in circles in my mind
and it always seems that i'm following you, girl
cause you take me to the places
that alone i'd never find

and even as i wander
i'm keeping you in sight
you're a candle in the window
on a cold, dark winter's night
and i'm getting closer than i ever thought i might

and i can't fight this feeling anymore
i've forgotten what i started fighting for
it's time to bring this ship into the shore
and throw away the oars, forever
cause i can't fight this feeling anymore
i've forgotten what i started fighting for
and if i have to crawl upon the floor
come crashing through your door
baby, i can't fight this feeling anymore

i needed someone to depend upon
i was alone, i was emotional
searching for the right emoticon
to expand my mental lexicon

then gemma told me that she met someone
it was the person i'd been counting on
it felt good, it felt transitional
a feeling i'd been waiting on

you were floating like a lilo
with your eyes closed, going where the tide goes
caught in flux, you drifted 'til you hit the sides
hold my breath another minute
i can keep my head, there's nothing in it
i'm a patient wave
and it's an easy ride

i saw myself an intellectual
i thought that i was capable
every move was just habitual
and life was just a ritual

then gemma told me that she met somebody
nobody else could take me from myself
i wasn't searching for it anymore
the feeling i'd been waiting for

you were floating like a lilo
with your eyes closed, going where the tide goes
caught in flux, you drifted 'til you hit the sides
hold my breath another minute
i can keep my head, there's nothing in it
i'm a patient wave  i'm a patient wave

please tell me why do birds sing when you're near me?
sing when you're close to me?
they say that i'm a fool for loving you deeply
loving you secretly

but i crash in my mind whenever you are near
getting deaf, dumb, and blind, just drowning in despair
i am lost in your flame, it's burning like a sun
and i call out your name the moment you are gone

but all the things that you've seen
slowly fade away

so i start a revolution from my bed
'cause you said the brains i had went to my head
step outside, summertime's in bloom
stand up beside the fireplace
take that look from off your face
you ain't ever gonna burn my heart out

and so, sally can wait
she knows it's too late as we're walking on by
her soul slides away
but don't look back in anger
i heard you say

take me to the place where you go
where nobody knows if it's night or day
please don't put your life in the hands
of a rock 'n' roll band
who'll throw it all away

still scratching around in the same old hole
my body feels young but my mind is very old
so what do you say?
you can't give me the dreams that were mine anyway
you're half the world away
half the world away

half the world away
i've been lost i've been found but i don't feel down

and when i leave this planet
you know i'd stay but i just can't stand it and
i can feel the warning signs
running around my mind
and if i could leave this spirit
i'll find me a hole and i'll live in it and
i can feel the warning signs
running around my mind

here i go
still scratching around in the same old hole
my body feels young but my mind is very old
so what do you say?
you can't give me the dreams that were mine anyway
you're half the world away
half the world away

half the world away
i've been lost i've been found but i don't feel down

no i don't feel down
no i don't feel down
i don't feel down
i don't feel down
don't feel down
i don't feel down


you might kill me with desire
wind me tighter than a wire
it's something that you do to me
i run away like mercury
and i know you think it's rough
when you're trying to patch us up
and i say honey what is love?
you just say i drink too much

maybe i'm defective
or maybe i'm dumb
i'm sorry, so sorry for what i've done
maybe i'm bad natured
or maybe i'm young
i'm sorry, so sorry for what i've done

and i'm the t shirt that i wear
pick the thorns out of my hair
i broke your heart so carelessly
i made the pieces part of me
and now it hurts what we've become
'cause you taught me how to love
it's me who taught you how to stop
and you just say i drink too much

maybe i'm defective
or maybe i'm dumb
i'm sorry, so sorry for what i've done
maybe i'm bad natured
or maybe i'm young
i'm sorry, so sorry for what i've done

i've waited for this
i'm ready for it
i've waited for this
i'm ready for it
i been waiting so long
i've waited for this
i'm ready for it
i've waited for this
i'm ready for it
i been waiting so long

maybe i'm defective
or maybe i'm dumb
i'm sorry, so sorry for what i've done
maybe i'm bad natured
or maybe i'm young
i'm sorry, so sorry for what i've done


well i heard there was a secret chord
that david played and it pleased the lord
but you don't really care for music, do you?
well it goes like this: the fourth, the fifth
the minor fall and the major lift
the baffled king composing hallelujah

hallelujah, hallelujah
hallelujah, hallelujah

your faith was strong but you needed proof
you saw her bathing on the roof
her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you
she tied you to her kitchen chair
she broke your throne and she cut your hair
and from your lips she drew the hallelujah

hallelujah, hallelujah
hallelujah, hallelujah

baby i've been here before
i've seen this room and i've walked this floor  you know 
i used to live alone before i knew you
and i've seen your flag on the marble arch
and love is not a victory march
it's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah

hallelujah, hallelujah
hallelujah, hallelujah

ooooh
ooooh
ooooh

maybe there's a god above
but all i've ever learned from love
was how to shoot somebody who outdrew you
and it's not a cry that you hear at night
it's not somebody who's seen the light
it's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah

hallelujah, hallelujah
hallelujah, hallelujah
hallelujah, hallelujah
hallelujah, hallelujah
hallelujah, hallelujah
hallelujah, hallelujah
hallelujah

it's in the way that she posed
it's in the things that she puts in my head
her stories are boring and stuff
she's always calling my bluff
she puts the, she puts the weights into my little heart
and she gets in my room and she takes it apart
she puts the weights into my little heart
i said she puts the weights into my little heart
she puts the weight, she puts the weight
she puts the weight, she puts the weight
she puts the weight, she puts the weight
she puts the weight, she puts the weight

it's in the way that she walks
her heaven is never enough
she puts the weights in my heart

were you born to resist or be abused?

is someone getting the best
the best, the best, the best of you?

i needed somewhere to hang my head without your noose
you gave me something that i didn't have, but had no use
i was too weak to give in, too strong to lose
my heart is under arrest again, but i break loose
my head is giving me life or death, but i can't choose
i swear i'll never give in, i refuse

is someone getting the best
the best, the best, the best of you?

transmission, third world war, third round
a decade of the weapon of sound above ground
no shelter if you're looking for shade
i lick shots at the brutal charade
as the polls close like a casket, on truth devoured
a silent play on the shadow of power
a spectacle monopolized
the cameras eyes on choice disguised
was it cast for the mass who burn and toil
or for the vultures who thirst for blood and oil?
yes, a spectacle monopolized
they hold the reins, stole your eyes
all the fist a gons, the bullets, and bombs
who stuff the banks, who staff the party ranks
more for gore or the son of a drug lord
none of the above, fuck it, cut the cord

you do it every day
you don't mean it, but it hurts like hell
my brain says i'm receiving pain
a lack of oxygen
from my life support, my iron lung

we're too young to fall asleep
too cynical to speak
we are losing it, can't you tell?
we scratch our eternal itch
our twentieth century bitch
we are grateful for our iron lung

the headshrinkers, they want my everything
my uncle bill, my belisha beacon
the headshrinkers, they want my everything
my uncle bill, my belisha beacon

suck, suck your teenage thumb
toilet trained and dumb
when the power runs out, we'll just hum
this, this is our new song
just like the last one
a total waste of time, my iron lung

the headshrinkers, they want my everything
my uncle bill, my belisha beacon
the headshrinkers, they want my everything
my uncle bill, my belisha beacon

and if you're frightened
you can be frightened

that beams me home

the troubled words of a troubled mind
i try to understand what is eating you
i try to stay awake, but it's 58 hours
since that i last slept with you

what are we coming to?
i just don't know anymore

blame it on the black star
blame it on the falling sky
blame it on the satellite
that beams me home

i get on the train and i just stand about
now that i don't think of you
i keep falling over, i keep passing out
when i see a face like you

what am i coming to?
i'm gonna melt down

blame it on the black star
blame it on the falling sky
blame it on the satellite
that beams me home

ah, this is killing me
ah, this is killing me


been thinking about you
your records are here
your eyes are on my wall
your teeth are over there
but i'm still no one
and you're my star
what do you care?

been thinking about you
and there's no rest
should i still love you

but i'm playing with myself
and what do you care when the other men are far, far better?

all the things you've got
all the things you need
who bought you cigarettes
who bribed the company to come and see you, honey?

i've been thinking about you
so how can you sleep?
these people aren't your friends
they're paid to kiss your feet
they don't know what i know
and why should you care, when i'm not there?


been thinking about you
and there's no rest
should i still love you

please forget the words that i just blurted out
it wasn't me, it was my strange and creeping doubt
it keeps rattling my cage
and there's nothing in this world will keep it down

even though i might, even though i try, i can't
even though i might, even though i try, i can't

so many things that keep, that keep me underground
so many words that i, that i can never find
if you give up on me now i'll be gutted like i've never been before

even though i might, even though i try, i can't
even though i might, even though i try, i can't

if you give up on me now
i'll be gutted like i've never been before

even though i might, even though i try, i can't
even though i might, even though i try, i can't


i'm back in black, no one to hold my hand
it seems that we're together, but alone
and now i hear the ticking of a clock
i know we're going down a slippery slope

i wonder what it's like out there
and my eyes are like far away spaceships  uh 
you are a sealed up door
there's gotta be more to our lives than this

we're fortune's fools when we took the bait
we sacrifice our lives for rock and roll
je ne sais pas, burning at the stake
we never really had a choice at all

i wonder what it's like out there
and my eyes are two far away spaceships
you are a sealed up door
and there's gotta be more to our lives than this

this girl i like

lower the curtain down on memphis
lower the curtain down, alright
i got no time for private consultation
under the milky way tonight

wish i knew what you were looking for
might have known what you would find
wish i knew what you were looking for
might have known what you would find

and it's something quite peculiar
something shimmering and white
it leads you here, despite your destination
under the milky way tonight

calling all comas
prisoner on the loose
description:
the spitting image of me
except for the heart shaped hole where the hope runs out

shock me awake
tear me apart
pinned like a note in a hospital gown
prisoner of sleep
deeper down
the rabbit hole never to be found
again

where are you hiding, my love?
cast off like a stone
feelings, raw and exposed
when i'm out of control
pieces were stolen from me
or dare i say, given away
watching the water give in
as i go down the drain
i appear missing now

i go missing
no longer exist
one day, i hope
i'm someone you'd miss

shock me awake
tear me apart
pinned like a note in a hospital gown
deeper asleep
further down
the rabbit hole never to be found
it's only falling in love
because you hit the ground

dancing on wire both ends are on fire
cut me loose
nowhere to run, no more room to pretend
wandering along the road in the summer night

i go missing
no longer exist
one day, i hope
i'm someone you'd miss

shock me awake
tear me apart
pinned like a note in a hospital gown
deeper asleep
further down
the rabbit hole never to be found

 confide 
with my toes on the edge it s such a lovely view
 don t cry 
i never loved anything until i loved you
 inside 
i m over the edge, what can i do?
 but shine 
i haven t a thing unless i have you
 confide 
with my toes on the edge it s such a lovely view
 don t cry 
i never loved anything until i loved you
 inside 
i m over the edge, what can i do?
 but shine 
i ve fallen through


once upon a time
i was of the mind
to lay your burden down
and leave you where you stood
you believed i could
you'd seen it done before
i could read your thoughts
and tell you what you saw
and never say a word
but now all that is gone
over with and done
never to return

and i can tell you why
people die alone
i can tell you i'm
a shadow on the sun

staring at the loss
looking for the cause
and never really sure
nothing but a hole
to live without a soul
and nothing to be learned

and i can tell you why
people go insane
i can show you how
you could do the same
i can tell you why
the end will never come
i can tell you i'm
a shadow on the sun

shapes of every size
move behind my eyes
doors inside my head
bolted from within
every drop of flame
lights a candle in
memory of the one
who lived inside my skin

and i can tell you why
people go insane
i can show you how
you could do the same
i can tell you why
the end will never come
i can tell you i'm
the shadow on the sun

shadow on the sun
shadow on the sun
shadow on the sun
shadow on the sun
shadow on the sun
shadow on the sun
shadow on the sun
shadow on the sun
sun, sun


every inch of sky's got a star
and every inch of skin's got a scar
i guess that you've got everything now
and every inch of space in your head
is filled up with the things that you read
i guess that you've got everything now
and every film that you've ever seen
fills the spaces up in your dreams
that reminds me
 everything now 
everything now  

every inch of road's got a sign
and every boy uses the same line
i pledge allegiance to everything now
and every song that i've ever heard
is playing at the same time, it's absurd
and it reminds me, we've got everything now
we turn the speakers up 'til they break
'cause every time you smile, it's a fake
stop pretending, you've got

 everything now   i need it
 everything now   i want it
 everything now   i can't live without
 everything now   i can't live without
 everything now 
everything now  
everything now

every inch of road's got a town
daddy, how come you're never around?
i miss you, like everything now
mama, leave the food on the stove
leave your car in the middle of the road
this happy family with everything now
we turn the speakers up 'til they break
'cause every time you smile, it's a fake
stop pretending, you've got

 everything now   i need it
 everything now   i want it
 everything now   i can't live without
 everything now   i can't live without
 everything now 
everything now  

'til every room in my house
is filled with shit i couldn't live without

 everything now   i need it
 everything now   i can't live without
 everything now 
everything now  
everything now

la, la, la, la, la, la la la
la, la, la, la, la la la
la, la, la, la, la la
la, la, la, la, la, la la la
la, la, la, la, la la la
la, la, la, la, la la
stop pretending, you've got

 everything now   i need it
 everything now   i want it
 everything now   i can't live without
 everything now   i can't live without
 everything now   i can't live
 everything now  

and every room in my house
is filled with shit i couldn't live without

 everything now   i need it
 everything now   i can't live without
 everything now   i can't live
 everything now  
every inch of space in my heart
is filled with something i'll never start

the ashes of everything now
and then you're black again
can't make it back again
from everything now


looks like we've been butting heads again, baby
lately seems like all we ever do
can't remember when things got so crazy
all i know is i don't know what to do
i guess we oughta stop and think it over
decide if what we want there's enough of
it's tearing us apart, it cuts right through the heart
it's an unintended consequence of love

remember how we fell into each other, baby
was all we could do to get up out of bed
you used to say nobody loved you better
i used to hang on every word you said
what happened to those brave and tender lovers?
how could we break the mighty promise of?
i guess time wore us down, expectations run aground
it's an unintended consequence of love

now baby, i'm the one that's taking chances
i know we've got a love worth fighting for
let's drop them petty games and pick up dancing
get back to where we're wanting nothing more, woo

i'm calling on you, baby, now or never
let's dig in deep and get out of this rut
we'll get back to what brought us both together, baby
find a way to resurrect our strut
'cause baby, you're my brave and tender lover
i know we'll find the mighty promise of
so come on, baby, back
we'll get this love on track
you're my one intended consequence of love

oh, consequence of love
of love
oh baby, yeah


what would you do if i sang out of tune
would you stand up and walk out on me?
lend me your ears and i'll sing you a song
and i'll try not to sing out of key

i get by with a little help from my friends
i get high with a little help from my friends
i'm going to try with a little help from my friends

what do i do when my love is away?
 does it worry you to be alone? 
how do i feel at the end of the day?
 are you sad because you're on your own? 


 do you need anybody? 
i need somebody to love
 could it be anybody? 
i just want someone to love

 would you believe in a love at first sight? 
yes, i'm certain that it happens all the time
 what do you see when you turn out the light? 
i can't tell you but i know it's mine





oh, i get by with a little help from my friends
with a little help from my friends
 by with a little help from my friends 


ricky was a young boy, he had a heart of stone
lived nine to five and he worked his fingers to the bone
just barely out of school, came from the edge of town
fought like a switchblade so no one could take him down, no

he had no money, no
no good at home
walked the streets a soldier and he fought the world alone
and now it's

eighteen and life, you got it
eighteen and life, you know
your crime is time and it's eighteen and life to go
eighteen and life, you got it
eighteen and life, you know
your crime is time and it's eighteen and life to go

tequila in his heartbeat, his veins burned gasoline
it kept his motor running but it never kept him clean
they say he loved adventure, "ricky's the wild one"
he married trouble, had a courtship with a gun

bang bang, shoot 'em up, the party never ends
you can't think of dying when the bottle's your best friend
and now it's

eighteen and life, you got it
eighteen and life, you know
your crime is time and it's eighteen and life to go
eighteen and life, you got it
eighteen and life, you know
your crime is time and it's eighteen and life to go
yeah, yeah

"accidents will happen," they all heard ricky say
he fired his six shot to the wind
and that child blew a child away, yeah, yeah
hey, hey, yeah, yeah, yeah

eighteen and life, you got it
eighteen and life, you know
your crime is time and it's eighteen and life to go
eighteen and life, you got it
eighteen and life, you know
your crime is time and it's eighteen and life to go
yeah

whoa, whoa, whoa


old friends
they shine like diamonds
old friends
you can always call
old friends
lord, you can't buy 'em
you know it's old friends after all

it's like when you're makin' conversation
and you're tryin' not to scream
you're tryin' not to tell 'em
you don't care what they mean
yeah, and you're feelin' really fragile
and you really can't get home
and you really feel abandoned
but you want to be alone

old friends
they shine like diamonds
old friends
you can always call
old friends
lord, you can't buy 'em
oh, it's old friends after all

and when the house is empty
and the lights begin to fade
and there's nothin' to protect you
except the window shade
and it's hard to put your finger
on the thing that scares you most
and you can't tell the difference
between an angel and a ghost

old friends
they shine like diamonds
old friends
you can always call
old friends
lord, you can't buy 'em
you know it's old friends after all

old friends
they shine like diamonds
old friends
you can always call
old friends
lord, you can't buy 'em
you know it's old friends after all
old friends  old friends 
they shine like diamonds
old friends  old friends 
you can always call
old friends
lord, you can't buy 'em
oh, it's old friends after all

two hearts that shouldn't
talk to each other become close
in a town much like a prison cell
people speak our names
on the street in hushed tones
oh, the stories they'd tell
if anyone would listen
if anyone would listen...
you come from a town where
people don't bother saying "hello"
unless somebody's born or dies
and i come from a place where they
drag your hopes through the mud
because their own dreams are all dying
and when we walk down the street
the wind sings our name in rebel songs
the sounds of the night should make us anxious
but it's much too late when the fear is gone
i will meet you in the next life, i promise you
where we can be together, i promise you
i will wait 'til then in heaven, i promise you
i promise, i promise
there's so many fighting
to get past the pearly gates
but nobody ever wants to die or get saved
their intentions aren't that good
and i can smell the asphalt
that's their personal road to hell being paved
and when we walk down the street
the wind sings our name in rebel songs
but it's much too late when the fear is gone
i will meet you in the next life, i promise you
where we can be together, i promise you
i will wait 'til then in heaven, i promise you
i promise, i promise

i will meet you in the next life, i promise you
where we can be together, i promise you
i will wait 'til then in heaven, i promise you
i promise, i promise

love me forever or not at all
end of our tether, backs to the wall
give me your hand, don't you ever ask why
promise me nothing, live till we die
everything changes, it all stays the same
everyone guilty, no one to blame
every way out brings you back to the start
everyone dies to break somebody's heart
we are the system, we are the law
we are corruption, worm in the core
one of another, laugh till you cry
faith unto death or a knife in your eye
everything changes, it all stays the same
everyone guilty, no one to blame
every way out takes you back to the start
everyone dies to break somebody's heart
oh, my lost love, come on back to me
love me or leave me, tell me no lies
ask me no questions, send me no spies
you know love's a thief, steal your heart in the night
slip through your fingers, best hold on tight
everything changes, it all stays the same
everyone guilty, no one to blame
every way out brings you back to the start
everyone dies to break somebody's heart
oh, my lost love, come on back to me


time has come and time is gone
cities burn, we got youth to spend
and time to waste in love
to live again, my friend
through the flames and through the fire
cities burn, we don't give a damn
'cause we got all our friends right here
we got youth to spend

'cause time away from me
is what i need to clear my sight and clear my head
i'm coming down over it, coming down over
coming down over
i'll be right there, i'm coming down over it
coming down over again

oh, oh oh oh
oh, oh oh oh oh
oh, oh oh oh

when all is said and all is done
our fathers run and leave all the damage
they've done behind
left us with the blind leading the blind
and time has come and time is done
cities burn, we don't give a damn
'cause we got all our friends right here
we got youth to spend

time away from me is what i need
to clear my sight and clear my head
i'm coming down over it, coming down over
coming down over
i'll be right there, i'm coming down over it
coming down over again

be right there, i'll be right there
down i go, i'll scream, i'll go down again
i feel my blood, i did my time
i'm deep in my head, i'm deep in my way
i'm deep in my soul
here i go
i'll be right there

i'm over it now, over it now, over it, i'm over it
over it, over it, over it
going over it, over and over it
finally over it, over it, over it
over and over it, over and over it
i mean over it, over and over it
over it, over and over it
over and over it
 the birds are all singing, "it's end of the world" 
 the birds are all singing, "it's end of the world" 
 the birds are all singing, "it's end of the world" 
 the birds are all singing, "it's end of the world" 
 the birds are all singing, "it's end of the world"

time away from me is what i need
to clear my sight and clear my head, clear my head

there's every good reason
for letting you go
she's sneaky and smoked out
and it's starting to show
i'll never let you go
i never let you go
i'll never let go
i never let you turn around
your back on each other
that's a good idea
break a promise to your mother
turn around
your back on each other
you say that i changed
well maybe i did
but even if i changed
what's wrong with it
i never let you go
i'll never let you go
i never let you go
i'll never let you turn around
your back on each other
that's a good idea
break a promise to your mother
turn around
your back on each other
and all our friends are gone
are gone
and all the time moves on and on
and all i know is it's wrong
it's wrong
if there's a reason
it's lost on me
maybe we'll be friends
i guess we'll see
i never let you go
i'll never let you go
turn around
your back on each other
that's a good idea
break a promise to your mother
turn around
let's turn on each other
good idea
break a promise to your mother
turn around
your back on each other
that's a good idea
break a promise to your mother
turn around your back on each other
what a good idea
i remember the stupid things
the mood rings
the bracelets and the beads
nickels and dimes
yours and mine
did you cash in all your dreams
you don't dream for me
no
but i still feel you pulsing like sonar
from the days in the waves
that girl is like a sunburn
i would like to save
she's like a sunburn


it's nine o'clock on a saturday
the regular crowd shuffles in
there's an old man sitting next to me
making love to his tonic and gin
he says, "son, can you play me a memory?
i'm not really sure how it goes
but it's sad and it's sweet and i knew it complete
when i wore a younger man's clothes."

la la la, di da da
la la, di da da da dum

sing us a song, you're the piano man
sing us a song tonight
well, we're all in the mood for a melody
and you've got us feeling alright

now john at the bar is a friend of mine
he gets me my drinks for free
and he's quick with a joke or to light up your smoke
but there's someplace that he'd rather be
he says, "bill, i believe this is killing me."
as the smile ran away from his face
"well i'm sure that i could be a movie star
if i could get out of this place"

la la la, di da da
la la, di da da da dum

now paul is a real estate novelist
who never had time for a wife
and he's talkin' with davy, who's still in the navy
and probably will be for life
and the waitress is practicing politics
as the businessmen slowly get stoned
yes, they're sharing a drink they call loneliness
but it's better than drinkin' alone

sing us a song, you're the piano man
sing us a song tonight
well, we're all in the mood for a melody
and you've got us feeling alright

it's a pretty good crowd for a saturday
and the manager gives me a smile
 cause he knows that it's me they've been comin' to see
to forget about life for a while
and the piano, it sounds like a carnival
and the microphone smells like a beer
and they sit at the bar and put bread in my jar
and say, "man, what are you doin' here?"

la la la, di da da
la la, di da da da dum

sing us a song, you're the piano man
sing us a song tonight
well, we're all in the mood for a melody
and you've got us feeling alright



brainstorm
take me away from the norm
i got to tell you something
this phenomenon
i had to put it in a song
and it goes like

whoa, amber is the color of your energy
whoa, shades of gold displayed naturally

you ought to know what brings me here
you glide through my head blind to fear
and i know why

whoa, amber is the color of your energy
whoa, shades of gold displayed naturally

whoa, amber is the color of your energy
whoa, shades of gold displayed naturally

you live too far away
your voice rings like a bell anyway
don't give up your independence
unless it feels so right
nothing good comes easily
sometimes you've got to fight

whoa, amber is the color of your energy
whoa, shades of gold displayed naturally
launched a thousand ships in my heart, so easy
still it's fine from afar, and you know that
whoa, brainstorm take me away from the norm
whoa, i got to tell you something

so you wanna be an outlaw, better take it from me
living on the highway, ain't everything it's suppose to be
everybody reckons that they wanna be free
ain't no body wants to be alone
stumblin in the alley at a quarter to three
hollaring after sally, "honey, what you trying to do to me."
told me "go to hell, i'm going back to tennessee."
i said, "angel, you can never go home."
never go home
never go home
if you wanna be an outlaw you can never go home
so you wanna be outlaw, better listen up kid
steal a million dollar and you have to keep it hid
ain't no place to spend it in the desert if you did
and you can't take it with you when you go
always something laying for you up around the bend
everything that goes around comes back around again
you can't trust anybody, not a lover or a friend
your momma, maybe, then you never know
never do know.  never do know. 
never do know.  no, you never do know. 
if you wanna be an outlaw, then you never do know
so you wanna be an outlaw, son you better think twice
you better not pout and you better not cry
cuz there won't nobody give a damn about you when you die
but the devil when he comes for his due
when you're standing at the cross roads, don't you try to flag a ride
don't you fall down on your knees, don't you do what's already been tried
hate to tell you but the only the left side is to sing the devil out of the blues
singing the blues
keep on singing the blues
sing the "so you wanna be an outlaw" blues
hey hey


that deputy don't get paid enough
risking their life tryna catch me on a country road
we're far from the city and this land is rough
and now i'm taking him out to a place that he don't know

oh, i'm almost home

i'm back in the woods again  back in the woods again 
i'm back in the woods again  back in the woods again 
and i know that mountain like the back of my hand
i'm back in the woods again  back in the woods again 

the buck shot went around past my ear
and i've run out, lose him down in a fog, yeah
the birds gonna let me know if he's near
and i'm gonna hide in a hollow log

oh, i'm almost home

i'm back in the woods again  back in the woods again 
i'm back in the woods again  back in the woods again 
and i know that mountain like the back of my hand
i'm back in the woods again  back in the woods again 


i'm back in the woods again
i'm back in the woods again
and i know that mountain like the back of my hand
i'm back in the woods again  back in the woods again 
i know that mountain like the back of my hand
i'm back in the woods again  back in the woods again 


since you never gave a damn in the first place
maybe it's time you had the tables turned
'cause in the interest of all involved, i got the problem solved
and the verdict is guilty 

man nearly killed me
steppin' where you fear to tread
stop, drop and roll   you were dead from the git go 
big mouth fucker, stupid cocksucker
are you scared of me now? then you're dumber than i thought
always is, and never was
foundation made of piss and vinegar

spit it out
all you wanna do is drag me down
all i wanna do is stamp you out

maybe it's the way you gotta spread a lot of rumor fodder
keepin' all your little spies and leavin' when you realize
step up, fairy

i guess we drunk enough
to die, to sink a ship
our lips too dry to kiss
i'm clinging onto silhouettes of you, of you

but it's me, myself and hollywood
just me, myself and hollywood
me, myself and hollywood
just me, me
and it's me, myself and hollywood
just me, myself and hollywood

from across the room
in the english language
you know i can't find you
tonight the truth will slip
this drink too strong too sip
i'm holding onto memories of you, of you

but it's me, myself and hollywood
just me, myself and hollywood

just me, me
and it's me, myself and hollywood
just me, myself and hollywood

just me, myself and hollywood
me, myself and hollywood
just me, myself and hollywood

one day my prayers are gonna be answered
so long i been hungry for something else
where there's a will there's a way
i work hard cause at the end of the day
the lord helps those who help themselves

hey, hey i keep my head down but i keep on swingin'
hey i keep my head down but i keep on swingin'
hey i keep my head down but i keep on swingin'
hey i keep my head down but i keep on swingin'

money's gonna find my hand one day and
when it does, i ain't looking back

doo doo doo, doo doo doo doo
doo doo doo, doo doo doo doo
doo doo doo, doo doo doo doo
doo doo doo

i'm packed and i'm holding, i'm smiling
she's living, she's golden, she lives for me
says she lives for me
ovation, her own motivation
she comes 'round and she goes down on me
and i make her smile like a drug for you
do ever what you want to do, coming over you
keep on smiling what we go through
one stop to the rhythm that divides you

and i speak to you like the chorus to the verse
chop another line like a coda with a curse
come on like a freak show, takes the stage
we give them the games we play, she say

i want something else
to get me through this
semi charmed kind of life, baby, baby
i want something else
i'm not listening when you say
goodbye

doo doo doo, doo doo doo doo
doo doo doo, doo doo doo doo
doo doo doo, doo doo doo doo
doo doo doo

the sky was gold, it was rose
i was taking sips of it through my nose
and i wish i could get back there, some place back there
smiling in the pictures you would take
doing crystal meth will lift you up until you break
it won't stop, i won't come down
i keep stock with a tick tock rhythm, a bump for the drop
and then i bumped up, i took the hit that i was given
then i bumped again, then i bumped again, i said

how do i get back there
to the place where i fell asleep inside you?
how do i get myself back to
the place where you said...

i want something else
to get me through this
semi charmed kind of life, baby, baby
i want something else
i'm not listening when you say
goodbye

i believe in the sand beneath my toes
the beach gives a feeling, an earthy feeling
i believe in the faith that grows
and the four right chords can make me cry
when i'm with you i feel like i could die
and that would be all right, all right
and when the plane came in, she said she was crashing
the velvet it rips in the city
we tripped on the urge to feel alive
but now i'm struggling to survive
those days you were wearing that velvet dress
you're the priestess, i must confess
those little red panties, they pass the test
so slide up 'round the belly face down on the mattress one
and you hold me
and we are broken
still it's all that i want to do, just a little now
feel myself head made of the ground
i'm scared, i'm not coming down
no, no
and i won't run for my life
she's got her jaws now locked down in a smile
but nothing is all right, all right

and i want something else
to get me through this life, baby
i want something else
not listening when you say
goodbye, goodbye
goodbye, goodbye

doo doo doo, doo doo doo doo
doo doo doo, doo doo doo doo
doo doo doo, doo doo doo doo

the sky was gold, it was rose
i was taking sips of it through my nose
and i wish i could get back there, some place back there
in the place we used to start our lives

doo doo doo, doo doo doo doo
doo doo doo, doo doo doo doo
doo doo doo, doo doo doo doo
 i want something else 


time is never worth my time
blue shine bleeds into my eyes
i still sleep on the right side
but white noise can't leave the scene behind

could i be anything you want me to be?
if so, is it meant to be seen?

when you see yourself in a crowded room
do your fingers itch? are you pistol whipped?
will you step in line or release the glitch?
can you fall asleep with a panic switch?
when you see yourself in a crowded room
do your fingers itch? are you pistol whipped?
will you step in line or release the glitch?
do you think she'll sleep with a panic?

i'll try to hold on tight tonight
pink slip inviting me inside
want to burn skin and brand what once was mine
but the red views keep ripping the divide

if i go everywhere you want me to go
how will i know you'll still follow?

when you see yourself in a crowded room?
do your fingers itch? are you pistol whipped?
will you step in line or release the glitch?
can you fall asleep with a panic switch?
when you see yourself in a crowded room
do your fingers itch? are you pistol whipped?
will you step in line or release the glitch?
do you think she'll sleep with a panic?

i'm waiting and fading and floating away
i'm waiting and fading and floating away
i'm waiting and fading and floating away
i'm waiting and fading and floating...


i'm waiting and fading and floating away
i'm waiting and fading and floating away
i'm waiting and fading and floating away
waiting and fading, waiting and fading

when you see yourself in a crowded room?
do your fingers itch? are you pistol whipped?
will you step in line or release the glitch?
can you fall asleep with a panic switch?

do you think she'll sleep with a panic?


we're self imploding
under the weight of your advice
i wear a suitcase
under each one of my eyes

finally
i know now what it takes
it takes money
and aeroplanes

if you love me, let me go
back to that bar in tokyo
where the demons from my past
leave me in peace
i'll be animating every night
the grass will be greener on the other side
and the vampires and wolves
won't sink their teeth
i'm sick of dancing with the beast...

astrophysics
you'll never be my closest friend
i find no comfort
in what my mind can't comprehend

finally
i work out what it takes
it takes money
and aeroplanes

if you love me, let me go
back to that bar in tokyo
where the demons from my past
leave me in peace
i'll be animating every night
the grass will be greener on the other side
and the vampires and wolves
won't sink their teeth
i'm sick of dancing with the beast...

no matter how much
it needs me
go and follow
someone else's lead

if you love me, let me go
back to that bar in tokyo
where the demons from my past
leave me in peace
i'll be animating every night
the grass will be greener on the other side
and the vampires and wolves
won't sink their teeth
i'm sick of dancing with the beast...


i wonder if we'll smile in our coffins
while loved ones mourn the day
the absence of our faces
living, laughing, eyes awake
is this too much for them to take?
too young for one's conclusion, the lifestyle won
such values you taught your son

that's how, that's how, that's how
look at me now

i'm broken
inherit my life
i'm broken

one day we all will die, a cliched fact of life
force fed to make us heed
inbred to sponge our bleed
every warning, a leaking rubber
a poison apple for mingled blood
too young for one's delusion, the lifestyle cost
venereal mother embrace the loss

that's how, that's how, that's how
look at you now

you're broken
inherit your life
you're broken

that's how, that's how, that's how
look at us now


i'm broken
inherit my life
i'm broken

that's how, that's how, that's how
look at me now
i'm broken, broken
i'm broken, broken
i'm broken, broken
i'm broke











lost in the sky
clouds roll by and i roll with them
arrows fly
seas increase and then fall again

this world is spinning around me
this world is spinning without me and
every day sends future to past
every breath leaves me one less to my last


watch the sparrow falling
gives new meaning to it all
if not today nor yet tomorrow
then some other day
i'll take seven lives for one
and then my only father's son
as sure as i did ever love him
i am not afraid

this world is spinning around me
the whole world keeps spinning around me
all life is future to past
every breath leaves me one less to my last



pull me under, pull me under
pull me under, i'm not afraid
all that i feel is honor and spite
all i can do is set it right


dust fills my eyes
clouds roll by and i roll with them
centuries cry
orders fly and i fall again

this world is spinning inside me
the whole world is spinning inside of me
every day sends future to past
every step brings me closer to my last



pull me under, pull me under
pull me under, i'm not afraid
living my life too much in the sun
only until your will is done




pull me under, pull me under
pull me under, i'm not afraid
all that i feel is honor and spite
all i can do is set it right

pull me under, pull me under
pull me under, i'm not afraid
living my life too much in the sun
only until your will is done




oh that this too
too solid flesh
would melt


i thought love was only true in fairy tales
meant for someone else but not for me
love was out to get me
that's the way it seemed
disappointment haunted all my dreams

then i saw her face, now i'm a believer
not a trace of doubt in my mind
i'm in love, i'm a believer 
i couldn't leave her if i tried

i thought love was more or less a givin' thing
seems the more i gave the less i got
what's the use in tryin'?
all you get is pain
when i needed sunshine i got rain

then i saw her face, now i'm a believer
not a trace of doubt in my mind
i'm in love, i'm a believer
i couldn't leave her if i tried


love was out to get me
that's the way it seemed
disappointment haunted all my dreams

then i saw her face, now i'm a believer
not a trace of doubt in my mind
i'm in love, i'm a believer
i couldn't leave her if i tried
then i saw her face, now i'm a believer
not a trace of doubt in my mind
and i'm a believer yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

rising up, back on the street
did my time, took my chances
went the distance, now i'm back on my feet
just a man and his will to survive
so many times it happens too fast
you trade your passion for glory
don't lose your grip on the dreams of the past
you must fight just to keep them alive

it's the eye of the tiger
it's the thrill of the fight
rising up to the challenge of our rival
and the last known survivor
stalks his prey in the night
and he's watching us all
with the eye of the tiger

face to face, out in the heat
hanging tough, staying hungry
they stack the odds 'til we take to the street
for the kill with the skill to survive

it's the eye of the tiger
it's the thrill of the fight
rising up to the challenge of our rival
and the last known survivor
stalks his prey in the night
and he's watching us all
with the eye of the tiger

rising up, straight to the top
had the guts, got the glory
went the distance, now i'm not going to stop
just a man and his will to survive

it's the eye of the tiger

rising up to the challenge of our rival

you can take anything and make it your own
don't you know that you can do anything
and you don't have to do it alone
searching for the girl i was
when i was sure and strong
when everything was easier
and i could do no wrong
if i could only believe in myself
i know i could find a way

sorry tears in my eyes
got me down in confusion and doubt

i'm no different than anyone working it out
we're all working it out

like a cobra they will strike
and like lions caged we'll fight
we were taken not by choice
they put anger in our voice
we were fearless but so afraid
though in our hearts we still felt pain
we're on fire but on a leash
we only ever wanted peace
never the heroes, we were made to fight
never the heroes, we were just sacrificed at war
like a demon leads the youth
we are terrible in truth
no time to falter, no turning back
when we come under attack
there is no question as with a friend
we have our honour to defend
we're on fire but on a leash
we only ever wanted peace
never the heroes, we were made to fight
never the heroes, we were just sacrificed at war
at war
we are together till the end
we have our honour to defend
never the heroes, we were made to fight

for real, they're sharper than the blade in your hand
they tell me you're strong, but they don't tell me what you feel
i feel there's something that you want me to hear
it's coming in loud and clear
you know what you want, what you want, what you want

in the name of love, i'll follow you
you fit me like a glove when i'm inside of you
and if nobody's there, it's cool, i'll die for you
in the name of love, i'll kill for

sticks and stones, break my bones
but bullet holes, you know they can't hurt me
invincible, unbreakable, unstoppable
i'll show you who's worthy
you grab the gun, i'll take the wheel
fuck the world, my love is real
fuck the world, my love is real
fuck the world, this love is real

shit's real, i need you to aim straight for my heart
and if you're gonna miss then hit my head and leave a permanent scar
you're fatal but i love who you are
be my death or my forever
you're my little bloodfeather
bloodfeather

in the name of love, i'll follow you
you fit me like a glove when i'm inside of you
if my body s dead and cold, i died for you
in the name of love, i'll kill for

here comes the night
a veil over the light
in the distance some shadows of the clouds in the sky
i've got to get home, to my child, my wife
here comes the night
i'm scared to death, got to get me a ride
it looks like the road is swallowing me up
gotta hurry home, don't dare to look back
blueville is straight ahead
another 45 miles to go
another 45 miles before i'm home
i wish i could pay the sun to run
then i had some more time, with my wife, my son
clouds in the sky
gathering for a fight
chasing their prey till it can't go on
i mend my pace 'cos my bride is waiting home
here comes the night
i'm scared to death, got to get me a ride
it looks like the road is swallowing me up
gotta hurry home, don't dare to look back
blueville is straight ahead
another 45 miles to go
another 45 miles before i'm home
i wish i could pay the sun to run
then i had some more time, with my wife, my son

dreaming 'bout the future and drinkin' on the past
tinkin' 'bout the things that been forgotten
tryin' to remember and tryin' to forget
that my life is empty without you
sayonara, close your eyes now little girl
'cause tomorrow is hidin' a whole different world
hold me now, you gotta guide me through the night
hold me now, and make it last forever
hold me now, be my guide just for a while
hold me now, make my ice cold blood turn warm
talkin'  bout our friends in love, our friends with broken hearts
the one's i always keep forgiving

devil just bought a brand new
devil just bought a brand new
devil just bought a brand new
penthouse in heaven
there goes the old neighbourhood
there goes the old neighbourhood
there goes the good old neighbourhood
on a one way trip to hell 
 shake you sinner  
jesus won't drive nothin'
but a shiny white mercedes
and all the angels gotta settle
for second hand oldsmobiles
the virgin mary loses faith
and starts a chain reaction
the lord just stands there weepin'
bitter tears in the rain
ain't that a shame 
 shake you sinner  
almost as if the bad guys
got the good guys on the run
all in the line of expectation
in the eyes of the evil one
like a mad bull chargin'
through a closet
of porcelain 'made in china'
saddlin' up the righteous
with nightmares full of trauma 
devil just bought a brand new
devil just bought a brand new
devil just bought a brand new
penthouse in heaven
there goes the old neighbourhood
there goes the old neighbourhood
there goes the good old neighbourhood
movin' on down to hell
there's no one here
there's nothin' left
no one here to kiss or bless
this damp and dark unholy mess
you could say: paradise in distress 
 shake you sinner 
behind the clouds
there's a silver line
the sun just can't stop waitin'
to put a shine on a clear blue sky
and kill the pessimist in me
meanwhile...

so strike a pose on a cadillac
if you want to find all the cops

i been knocking on the door that holds the throne
i been looking for the map that leads me home
i been stumbling on good hearts turned to stone
the road of good intentions has gone dry as a bone
we take care of our own
we take care of our own
wherever this flag's flown
we take care of our own
from chicago to new orleans, from the muscle to the bone
from the shotgun shack to the superdome
there ain't no help, the cavalry stayed home
there ain't no one hearing the bugle blowin'
we take care of our own
we take care of our own
wherever this flag's flown
we take care of our own
where're the eyes, the eyes with the will to see
where're the hearts that run over with mercy
where's the love that has not forsaken me
where's the work that set my hands, my soul free
where's the spirit that'll reign, reign over me
where's the promise from sea to the shining sea
where's the promise from sea to the shining sea
wherever this flag is flown
wherever this flag is flown
wherever this flag is flown
we take care of our own
we take care of our own
wherever this flag's flown
we take care of our own
we take care of our own
we take care of our own
wherever this flag's flown
we take care of our own

and now i swallow whole
i'll never live in the past
let freedom ring with a shotgun blast
burn my fist to the concrete
my fear is my strength

cyanide blood burns down the skyline
hatred is purity
the bullet connects at last
let freedom ring with a shotgun blast
scarred

no man's land

chaos a.d
disorder unleashed
starting to burn
starting to lynch
silence means death
stand on your feet
inner fear
your worst enemy

you close your eyes
and leave me naked by your side
you close the door so i can't see
the love you keep inside
the love you keep for me
it fills me up
it feels like living in a dream
it fills me up so i can't see
the love you keep inside
the love you keep for me

i stay to watch you fade away
i dream of you tonight
tomorrow you'll be gone
it gives me time to stay
to watch you fade away
i dream of you tonight
tomorrow you'll be gone
i wish by god you'd stay

i stay awake
i stay awake and watch you breathe
i stay awake and watch you fly
away into the night
escaping through a dream

i stay to watch you fade away
i dream of you tonight
tomorrow you'll be gone
it gives me time to stay
to watch you fade away
i dream of you tonight
tomorrow you'll be gone
i wish by god you'd stay

hey...
stay...

i stay to watch you fade away
i dream of you tonight
tomorrow you'll be gone
it gives me time to stay
to watch you fade away

stay...
stay...

i wish by god you'd stay


i don't mean to dwell
but i can't help myself
when i feel the vibe
and taste a memory
of a time in life
when years seemed to stand still

i close my eyes
and sink within myself
relive the gift of precious memories
in need of a fix called innocence
when did it begin?
the change to come was undetectable
the open wounds expose the importance of
our innocence
a high that can never be bought or sold

symbolic acts, so vivid
yet at the same time
were invisible

savor what you feel and what you see
things that may not seem important now
but may be tomorrow
do you remember when
things seemed so eternal?
heroes were so real
their magic frozen in time
the only way to learn
is be aware and hold on tight

i close my eyes
and sink within myself
relive the gift of precious memories
in need of a fix called innocence
when did it begin?
the change to come was undetectable
the open wounds expose the importance of
our innocence
a high that can never be bought or sold

symbolic acts, so vivid
yet at the same time
were invisible


you might kill me with desire
wind me tighter than a wire
it's something that you do to me
i run away like mercury
and i know you think it's rough
when you're trying to patch us up
and i say honey what is love?
you just say i drink too much

maybe i'm defective
or maybe i'm dumb
i'm sorry, so sorry for what i've done
maybe i'm bad natured
or maybe i'm young
i'm sorry, so sorry for what i've done

and i'm the t shirt that i wear
pick the thorns out of my hair
i broke your heart so carelessly
i made the pieces part of me
and now it hurts what we've become
'cause you taught me how to love
it's me who taught you how to stop
and you just say i drink too much

maybe i'm defective
or maybe i'm dumb
i'm sorry, so sorry for what i've done
maybe i'm bad natured
or maybe i'm young
i'm sorry, so sorry for what i've done

i've waited for this
i'm ready for it
i've waited for this
i'm ready for it
i been waiting so long
i've waited for this
i'm ready for it
i've waited for this
i'm ready for it
i been waiting so long

maybe i'm defective
or maybe i'm dumb
i'm sorry, so sorry for what i've done
maybe i'm bad natured
or maybe i'm young
i'm sorry, so sorry for what i've done


ooh, baby, don't you know i suffer?
ooh, baby, can't you hear me moan?
you caught me under false pretenses
how long before you let me go?

oooooooooooooh, you set my soul alight
oooooooooooooh, you set my soul alight

glaciers melting in the dead of night
and the superstar's sucked into the supermassive
 ooooooooooooh, you set my soul alight 
glaciers melting in the dead of night
and the superstar's sucked into the...
 ooooooooooooh, you set my soul  
into the supermassive

i thought i was a fool for no one
but ooh, baby i'm a fool for you
you're the queen of the superficial
and how long before you tell the truth?

oooooooooooooh, you set my soul alight
oooooooooooooh, you set my soul alight

glaciers melting in the dead of night
and the superstar's sucked into the supermassive
 ooooooooooooh, you set my soul alight

oh i'd rather go and journey
where the diamond crest is flowing
and run across the valley beneath the sacred mountain
and wander through the forest
where the the trees have leaves of prisms
and break the light in colors
that no one knows the names of
and when it's time i'll go
and wait beside a legendary fountain
till i see your form reflected
in it's clear and jewelled waters
and if you think i'm ready
you may lead me to the chasm
where the rivers of our vision
flow into one another
i will want to die beneath the white cascading waters
she may beg, she may plead
she may argue with her logic
and then she'll know the things i learned
that really have no value
in the end she will surely know
i wasn't born to follow

no, i can't forget this evening
or your face as you were leaving
but i guess that's just the way the story goes
you always smile but in your eyes your sorrow shows
yes, it shows
no, i can't forget tomorrow
when i think of all my sorrow
when i had you there but then i let you go
and now it's only fair that i should let you know
what you should know
i can't live if living is without you
i can't live, i can't give anymore
i can't live if living is without you
i can't give, i can't give anymore
well, i can't forget this evening
or your face as you were leaving
but i guess that's just the way the story goes
you always smile but in your eyes your sorrow shows
yes, it shows
can't live if living is without you
i can't live, i can't give anymore
i can't live if living is without you
can't live, i can't give anymore
 living is without you 

the word that would
best describe this feeling would be, 'haunted'
i touch the clothes you left behind
that still retain your shape and lines, still haunted
i trace the outline of your eyes
blue in the mirror, hypnotized and haunted
i find a solitary hair gone
and still i reminisce, i'm haunted
haunted by your soul
haunted by your hair
haunted by your clothes
haunted by your eyes
by your soul, by your hair
by your clothes, by your eyes
by your voice, by your smile
by your mouth, by your soul
by your hair, by your clothes
by your eyes, by your voice
by your smile, by your mouth
by your soul, haunted  haunted 
so this is for when you feel happy
and this is for when you feel sad
and this is for when you feel...
nothing
ohh, when the minutes drag
ohh, when the minutes drag
and this is for the tears that won't dry
and this is for a bright blue sky
and this is for when you feel...
lucky
and this is for when you feel...
lucky
ohh, when the minutes drag
ohh, when the minutes drag
so this is for when you're feeling happy again
and this is for when you're feeling sad
and this is for when you feel...
something
ohh, when the minutes drag
ohh, when the minutes drag
haunted  haunted 
when the minutes drag
haunted  haunted 
when the minutes drag
ohh
ohh

making sense of what i've heard
and what is on my mind
don't look down cause it's far to fall
count the hours, face the fear
it's haunting me these days
we're past the post and through the door
hail, commercial suicide
kiss the life you left behind
don't let it bother you
you do what it takes to get what you can
last night i thought about
another life and what i'd do
it's hanging over me
i'm sure to break your loving heart
i'm dying to take a walk
down this sugar coated sonic path
cause i've been hanging around for hours
staring at your hologram
outside a northern harbour
digging up the harder times
i might have known that you'd been
tearing up the photographs
standing on your holy ground
lost sight of all i've done
picking round for higher ground
guests out in paradise
with china dolls and better times
the satellite is always overhead
it's watching you
you know it's living hell
i'm solid gone, coming for no one, no one, no one


this is the greatest and best song in the world...
tribute

long time ago, me and my brother kyle here
we was hitchhikin' down a long and lonesome road
all of a sudden, there shined a shiny demon
in the middle of the road
and he said
"play the best song in the world
or i'll eat your soul"  soul 
well, me and kyle
we looked at each other
and we each said
"okay"
and we played the first thing
that came to our heads
just so happened to be
the best song in the world
it was the best song in the world

look into my eyes
and it's easy to see
one and one make two
two and one make three
it was destiny
once every hundred thousand years or so
when the sun doth shine
and the moon doth glow
and the grass doth grow

needless to say
the beast was stunned
a whip crack went his whippy tail
and the beast was done
he asked us
"snort
be you angels?"
and we said
"nay
we are but men "
rock
ahhh, ahhh, ahhh ah ah
ohhh, whoah
ah whoah oh

this is not
the greatest song in the world, no
this is just a tribute
couldn't remember
the greatest song in the world, no, no
this is a tribute, oh
to the greatest song in the world
alright
it was the greatest song in the world
alright
yeah it was the best motherfuckin' song
the greatest song in the world

ah rah, dee
soo guh goo gee goo gee
goo guh fli goo gee goo
guh fli goo, ga goo buh dee
ooh, guh goo bee
ooh guh guh bee guh guh bee
fli goo gee goo
a fliguh woo wa mama lucifer 

and the peculiar thing is this my friends
the song we sang on that fateful night
it didn't actually sound anything like this song 

this is just a tribute
you've got to believe me
and i wish you were there
just a matter of opinion
ah, fuck 
good god
gotta love it
so surprised to find you can't stop it
oh hallelujah, i'm found
rich motherfucker, aw
alright
alright


breathing in the dark
lying on its side
the ruins of the day
painted with a scar
and the more i straighten out
the less it wants to try
the feelings start to rot
one wink at a time

oh
forgiving who you are
for what you stand to gain
just know that if you hide
it doesn't go away
when you get out of bed
don't end up stranded
horrified with each stone
on the stage
my little dark age

picking through the cards
knowing what's nearby
the carvings on the face
say they find it hard
and the engine's failed again
all limits of disguise
the humor's not the same
coming from denial

oh
i grieve in stereo
the stereo sounds strange
i know that if you hide
it doesn't go away
if you get out of bed
and find me standing all alone
open eyed
burn the page
my little dark age

i grieve in stereo
the stereo sounds strange
you know that if it hides
it doesn't go away
if i get out of bed
you'll see me standing all alone
horrified
on the stage
my little dark age

giddy with delight
seeing what's to come
the image of the dead
dead ends in my mind

policemen swear to god
love's seeping from the guns
i know my friends and i
would probably turn and run
if you get out of bed
come find us heading for the bridge
bring a stone
all the rage
my little dark age

i grieve in stereo
the stereo sounds strange
i know that if you hide
it doesn't go away
if you get out of bed
and find me standing all alone
open eyed
burn the page
my little dark age

all alone
open eyed
burn the page
my little dark age


right this way
the room's full to burst
whatever you say
gotta quench that thirst

i got a little secret for you
it's in a magazine
you got an image to keep safe
bitten nails stay clean, yeah

now talk the loudest with a clenched fist
top of a hit list, gag a witness
it takes a fat lip to run a tight ship
just talk the loudest with a clenched fist

flash your winning smile
let your eyes work the room
these people are here for you
you're the bride, you're the groom

i got a little secret for you
it's in a magazine
you got an image to keep safe
bitten nails stay clean, yeah

now talk the loudest with a clenched fist
top of a hit list, gag a witness
it takes a fat lip to run a tight ship
just talk the loudest with a clenched fist
yeah, you talk the loudest


now talk the loudest with a clenched fist
top of a hit list, gag a witness
it takes a fat lip to run a tight ship
now talk the loudest, you're making them sing, you're making them sing

it don't mean a thing, it don't mean a thing
you're making them sing, you're making them sing
it don't mean a thing, it don't mean a thing
you're making them sing, you're making them sing
it don't mean a thing, it don't mean a, don't mean a, don't mean a thing
it don't mean a thing


spent the day in bed
very happy i did, yes
i spent the day in bed
as the workers stay enslaved
i spent the day in bed
i'm not my type
but i love my bed
and i recommend that you

stop watching the news
because the news contrives to frighten you
to make you feel small and alone
to make you feel that your mind isn't your own

i spent the day in bed, it's a consolation
when all my dreams are perfectly legal
in sheets for which i paid, i am now laid
and i recommend to all of my friends that they

stop watching the news
because the news contrives to frighten you
to make you feel small and alone
to make you feel that your mind isn't your own

oh time, do as i wish
time, do as i wish
oh time, do as i wish
time, do as i wish
oh time, do as i wish
time, do as i wish
oh time, do as i wish, do as i wish

i spent the day in bed
you can please yourself, but
i spent the day in bed
pillows like pillars
life ends in death
so, there's nothing wrong with being good to yourself
be good to yourself for once 

and no bus, no boss, no rain, no train
no bus, no boss, no rain, no train
no bus, no boss, no rain, no train
no emasculation, no castration
no highway, freeway, motorway
no bus, no boss, no rain, no train
no bus, no boss, no rain, no train
no bus, no boss, no rain, no train


live another day
climb a little higher
find another reason to stay
ashes in your hands
mercy in your eyes
if you're searching for a silent sky...

you won't find it here
look another way
you won't find it here
so die another day


the coldness of his words
the message in his silence
"face the candle to the wind..."
this distance in my voice
isn't leaving you a choice
so if you're looking for a time to run away...

you won't find it here
look another way
you won't find it here
so try another day

they took pictures of our dreams
ran to hide behind the stairs
and said, "maybe when it's right for you, they'll fall"
but if they don't come down
resist the need to pull them in and throw them away
better to save the mystery
than surrender to the secret


you won't find it here
look another way
you won't find it here
so try another day



gazing through the window at the world outside
wondering will mother earth survive
hoping that mankind will stop abusing her sometime
after all there's only just the two of us
and here we are still fighting for our lives
watching all of history repeat itself
time after time

i'm just a dreamer
i dream my life away
i'm just a dreamer
who dreams of better days

i watch the sun go down like everyone of us
i'm hoping that the dawn will bring a sign
a better place for those who will come after us
this time


your higher power may be god or jesus christ
it doesn't really matter much to me
without each others help there ain't no hope for us
i'm living in a dream of fantasy
oh yeah, yeah, yeah
if only we could all just find serenity
it would be nice if we could live as one
when will all this anger, hate and bigotry be gone?

i'm just a dreamer, i dream my life away, today
i'm just a dreamer, who dreams of better days, okay
i'm just a dreamer, who's searching for the way, today
i'm just a dreamer, dreaming my life away
oh yeah, yeah, yeah


you might kill me with desire
wind me tighter than a wire
it's something that you do to me
i run away like mercury
and i know you think it's rough
when you're trying to patch us up
and i say honey what is love?
you just say i drink too much

maybe i'm defective
or maybe i'm dumb
i'm sorry, so sorry for what i've done
maybe i'm bad natured
or maybe i'm young
i'm sorry, so sorry for what i've done

and i'm the t shirt that i wear
pick the thorns out of my hair
i broke your heart so carelessly
i made the pieces part of me
and now it hurts what we've become
'cause you taught me how to love
it's me who taught you how to stop
and you just say i drink too much

maybe i'm defective
or maybe i'm dumb
i'm sorry, so sorry for what i've done
maybe i'm bad natured
or maybe i'm young
i'm sorry, so sorry for what i've done

i've waited for this
i'm ready for it
i've waited for this
i'm ready for it
i been waiting so long
i've waited for this
i'm ready for it
i've waited for this
i'm ready for it
i been waiting so long

maybe i'm defective
or maybe i'm dumb
i'm sorry, so sorry for what i've done
maybe i'm bad natured
or maybe i'm young
i'm sorry, so sorry for what i've done

there's a time and place for everything, for everyone
we can push with all our might, but nothing's gonna come
oh no, nothing's gonna change
and if i asked you not to try
oh could you let it be
i wanna hold you and say
we can't throw this all away
tell me you won't go, you won't go
do you have to hear me say

i can't stop lovin' you
and no matter what you say or do
you know my heart is true, oh
i can't stop lovin' you
you can change your friends, your place in life
you can change your mind
we can change the things we say
and do it anytime
oh no, but i think you'll find
that when you look inside your heart
oh baby, i'll be there
hold on
i'm holding on
baby, just come on, come on, come on
i just wanna hear you say

oh, i'm twisted and tied
and all i can remember
is how hard we tried
only to surrender
and when it's over
i know how it's gonna be
and true love will never die
no, not fade away

and i know what i got to do
hey ray, what you said is true
i can't stop lovin' you, oh
oh, i can't stop lovin' you


you and i together in our lives
sacred ties would never fray
then why can i let myself tell lies
and watch you die every day?
i think back to the times
when dreams were what mattered
tough talking youth naivete

you said you'd never let me down
but the horse stampedes and rages
in the name of desperation

is it all just wasted time
can you look at yourself
when you think of what you left behind?
is it all just wasted time
can you live with yourself
when you think of what you've left behind?

paranoid delusions, they haunt you
where's my friend i used to know?
he's all alone, he's buried deep within a
carcass searching for a soul
can you feel me inside your heart as it's bleeding?
why can't you believe you can be loved?

i hear your scream in agony
and the horse stampedes and rages
in the name of desperation

is it all just wasted time
can you look at yourself
when you think of what you left behind?
is it all just wasted time
can you live with yourself
when you think of what you've left behind


oh, you said you never let me down
but the horse stampedes and rages
in the name of desperation

is it all just wasted time
can you look at yourself
when you think of what you left behind?
is it all just wasted time
can you live with yourself
when you think of what you've left behind?

the sun will rise again, the earth will turn to sand
creation's colors seem to fade to grey
and you'll see the sickly hands of time will write your final rhyme
and end your memory
i never thought you'd let it get this far, boy
i never thought you'd let it get this far, boy, oh no
i never thought, i never thought you'd let it get this far, boy
i never thought, i never thought you'd let it get this far, boy

have you ever climbed the mountain?
have you ever crossed the sea?
take a look around the corner
and listen to your heartbeat
have you ever touched the rainbow
take a ride in the ferris wheel
it takes one step to start a journey
it's up to you, to make it real
this is the time for yourself to be free
you gotta follow your heart
this is the time in your life and it's never too late
to see the light in the dark
you gotta follow your heart
walking far away horizons
you will never walk alone
you'll be at home where your heart is
a million miles away from home
show me the way, who knows the way
this is the only road to go
life brings me down, it takes me up
and only, only heaven knows

i'm gonna take you
to a place far from here
no one will see us
watch the pain as it disappears
no time for anger
no time for despair
won't you come with me
there's room for us there
this innocent beauty
my words can't describe
this rebirth to purity
brings a sullen tear right to your eyes
no time for anger
no time for despair
please let me take you
'cause i'm already there
i'm so alone
my head's my home
i'll return to serenity
rhyme without reason
is why children cry
they see through the system
that's breeding them just so they die
so please let me take you
and i'll show you the truth
inside my reality
we shared in my youth
i'm so alone
my head's my home
and i feel
so alone
you know
at last
i return to serenity
now that i've taken you
to a place far from here
i really must go back
close your eyes and we'll disappear
won't you come with me
salvation we'll share
inside of my head now
there's room for us there
chorus

i'm gonna take you
to a place far from here
no one will see us
watch the pain as it disappears

i jump from thought to thought like a flea jumps to a light
you could give an aspirin the headache of its life
maybe it's the crazy that i'd miss
watering plastic plants in the hope that they'll grow
seeing a message flash and then smashing up my phone
maybe it's the crazy that i'd miss
it won't get better than this

i like the way your brain works, i like the way you try
to run with the wolf pack when your legs are tied
i like the way you turn me inside and out
i like the way you turn
 woo, ooh ooh, ooh ooh
ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh 
i like the way your brain works
 woo, ooh ooh, ooh ooh
ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh 
i like the way your brain works

i want to get college girl drunk tonight
no morning fears, no mountains to climb
they say the best memories are the ones that we forget
like listening to drake at your best friend's swimming pool
floating anti clockwise in a red mushroom
maybe it's the crazy that i'd miss
it won't get better than this

i like the way your brain works, i like the way you try
to run with the wolf pack when your legs are tied
i like the way you turn me inside and out
i like the way you turn
 woo, ooh ooh, ooh ooh
ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh 
i like the way your brain works
 woo, ooh ooh, ooh ooh
ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh 
i like the way your brain works

baby, it's the crazy i like
i think i saw the world turn in your eyes
baby, it's the crazy i like  ah ah, ah 
and maybe it's the bullshit i'd miss
screaming at the moon in black lipstick
maybe it's the bullshit i'd miss
it won't get better than this


i want my money back
i'm down here drowning in your fat
you got me on my knees
praying for everything you lack
i ain't afraid of you
i'm just a victim of your fears
you cower in your tower
praying that i'll disappear
i got another plan
one that requires me to stand
on the stage or in the street
don't need no microphone or beat
and when you hear this song
if you ain't dead sing along
bang and strum to these here drums
till you get where you belong

i got a list of demands
written on the palm of my hands
i ball my fist, you're gonna
know where i stand
i'm living hand to mouth
you wanna be somebody? see somebody?
try and free somebody?
i got a list of demands
written on the palm of my hands
i ball my fist, you're gonna
know where i stand
i'm living hand to mouth
hand to mouth

i wrote a song for you today
while i was sitting in my room
i jumped up on my bed today
and i played it on a broom
i didn't think that it would be a song
that you would hear
but when i played it in my head
i made you reappear
i wrote a video for it
and i acted out each part
and then i took your picture out
and taped it to my heart
i've taped you to my heart, dear
i've taped you to my
heart and if you pull away from me
you'll tear my life apart

i got a list of demands
written on the palm of my hands
i ball my fist, you're gonna
know where i stand
i'm living hand to mouth
you wanna be somebody? see somebody?
try and free somebody?
i got a list of demands

all i wanna do when i wake up in the morning is see your eyes
rosanna, rosanna
i never thought that a girl like you could ever care for me
rosanna

all i wanna do in the middle of the evening is hold you tight
rosanna, rosanna
i didn't know you were looking for more than i could ever be

not quite a year since she went away, rosanna yeah

rosanna, rosanna
i didn't know that a girl like you could make me feel so sad
rosanna

all i want to tell you is now you'll never ever have to compromise
rosanna, rosanna
i never thought that losing you could ever hurt so bad

not quite a year since she went away, rosanna yeah

something takes a part of me
something lost and never seen
every time i start to believe
something's raped and taken from me, from me

life's gotta always be messing with me
can't they chill and let me be free?
can't i take away all this pain?
i try to every night, all in vain, in vain

sometimes i cannot take this place
sometimes it's my life i can't taste
sometimes i cannot feel my face
you'll never see me fall from grace

something takes a part of me
you and i were meant to be
a cheap fuck for me to lay
something takes a part of me

feeling like a freak on a leash
feeling like i have no release
how many times have i felt diseased?
nothing in my life is free, is free

sometimes i cannot take this place
sometimes it's my life i can't taste
sometimes i cannot feel my face
you'll never see me fall from grace

something takes a part of me
you and i were meant to be
a cheap fuck for me to lay
something takes a part of me...

ain't no sunshine when she's gone
it's not warm when she's away
ain't no sunshine when she's gone
and she's always gone too long anytime she goes away

ain't no sunshine when she's gone
and this house just ain't no home anytime she goes away

carry on my wayward son
there'll be peace when you are done
lay your weary head to rest
don't you cry no more

once i rose above the noise and confusion
just to get a glimpse beyond this illusion
i was soaring ever higher
but i flew too high
though my eyes could see i still was a blind man
though my mind could think i still was a mad man
i hear the voices when i'm dreaming
i can hear them say

carry on my wayward son
there'll be peace when you are done
lay your weary head to rest
don't you cry no more

masquerading as a man with a reason
my charade is the event of the season
and if i claim to be a wise man, well
it surely means that i don't know
on a stormy sea of moving emotion
tossed about i'm like a ship on the ocean
i set a course for winds of fortune
but i hear the voices say

carry on my wayward son
there'll be peace when you are done
lay your weary head to rest
don't you cry no more
no 


carry on, you will always remember
carry on, nothing equals the splendor
now your life's no longer empty
but surely heaven waits for you

carry on my wayward son
there'll be peace when you are done
lay your weary head to rest
don't you cry
don't you cry no more

no more 

fly me to the moon, let me play among the stars
let me see what spring is like on jupiter and mars
in other words, hold my hand

you are all i long for, all i worship and adore
in other words, please, be true
in other words, i love you
in other words, hold my hand
in other words, darling, kiss me
fill my life with song and let me sing for ever more
you are all i long for, all i worship and adore
in other words, please, please, be true
in other words, i love you

there's a somebody i'm longing to see
i hope that she turns out to be
someone who'll watch over me
i'm a little lamb who's lost in a wood
i know i could always be good
to one who'll watch over me
although i may not be the man
some girls think of as handsome
but to her heart
i carry the key
won't you tell her please to put on some speed
follow my lead, oh how i need
someone to watch over me
i'm a little lamb who's lost in a wood
i know i could always be good
to one who'll watch over me
although i may not be the man
some girls think of as handsome
but to her heart
i carry the key
and this world would be like heaven, if she'd
follow my lead, oh how i need
someone to watch over me

that you won't

what it is
that i've done
to make me


you could have a change of heart, if you would only change your mind
instead of slamming down the phone girl, for the hundredth time
i got your number on my wall, but i ain't gonna make that call
when divided we stand baby, united we fall

got the time got a chance gonna make it
got my hands on your heart gonna take it
all i know i can't fight this flame
you could have a change of heart, if you would only change your mind
cause i'm crazy 'bout you baby, time after time

without you
one night alone
is like a year without you baby
do you have a heart of stone
without you
can't stop the hurt inside
when love and hate collide

i don't wanna fight no more, i don't know what we're fighting for
when we treat each other baby, like an act of war
i could tell a million lies and it would come as no surprise
when the truth is like a stranger, hits you right between the eyes

there's a time and a place and a reason
and i know i got a love to believe in
all i know got to win this time

without you
one night alone
is like a year without you baby

without you
one night alone
is like a year without you baby
if you have a heart at all
without you
can't stop the hurt inside
when love and hate collide


i remember flashbacks lighting up magic whip
eight o'clock, kowloon emptiness, handle it
the white horse image i had of you eleven seconds ago
i didn't send you, so you will never know
i got away for a little while
but then it came back much harder

swinging on a cable up to po lin
climbing panda, ghostly wine, and a battery
that light in your eyes i search for religiously
when it's not there, oh lord, it's hurting me
i got away for a little while
but then it came back much harder

'til i ever hold you out there again, will you be mine?
'cause i'm on a ghost ship drowning my heart in hong kong
it's the last ride boarding here tonight
out in the bay  out in the bay 
i'll need a lantern in you to shine out bright rays

feeling out of body here, what can i do?
it's up to the top every day to join with you
i had to get away for a little while
but then it came back much harder

'til i ever hold you out there again, will you be mine?
'cause i'm on a ghost ship drowning my heart in hong kong
it's the last ride boarding here tonight
out in the bay  out in the bay 
i'll need a lantern in you to shine out bright rays


'til i ever hold you out there again, will you be mine?
'cause i'm on a ghost ship drowning my heart in hong kong
it's the last ride boarding here tonight
out in the bay  out in the bay 
i'll need a lantern in you to shine out bright rays
bright rays, bright rays



living easy, living free
season ticket on a one way ride
asking nothing, leave me be
taking everythin' in my stride
don't need reason
don't need rhyme
ain't nothing i d rather do
goin' down
party time
my friends are gonna be there too, yeah

i m on the highway to hell
on the highway to hell
highway to hell
i m on the highway to hell

no stop signs
speed limit
nobody's gonna slow me down
like a wheel
gonna spin it
nobody's gonna mess me around
hey satan
payin' my dues
playing in a rocking band
hey mama
look at me
i m on the way to the promised land
woo 

i m on the highway to hell
highway to hell
i m on the highway to hell
highway to hell

don't stop me
heh, heh 


i m on the highway to hell

 highway to hell 

and i m going down
all the way
i m on the highway to hell


i'm feeling rough, i'm feeling raw
i'm in the prime of my life
let's make some music, make some money
find some models for wives
i'll move to paris, shoot some heroin
and fuck with the stars
you man the island and the cocaine
and the elegant cars

this is our decision, to live fast and die young
we've got the vision, now let's have some fun
yeah, it's overwhelming, but what else can we do?
get jobs in offices and wake up for the morning commute?
forget about our mothers and our friends
we're fated to pretend
to pretend
we're fated to pretend
to pretend

i'll miss the playgrounds
and the animals and digging up worms
i'll miss the comfort of my mother
and the weight of the world
i'll miss my sister, miss my father
miss my dog and my home
yeah, i'll miss the boredom and the freedom
and the time spent alone

but there is really nothing, nothing we can do
love must be forgotten, life can always start up anew
the models will have children, we'll get a divorce
we'll find some more models, everything must run its course
we'll choke on our vomit and that will be the end
we were fated to pretend
to pretend
we're fated to pretend
to pretend

i said yeah, yeah, yeah
yeah, yeah, yeah
yeah, yeah, yeah
yeah, yeah, yeah


a growing sickness in the heart
defective, lack of control
the cure is somewhere in the silence
but i'm crushed by the noise inside

don't lock the door on me
you'd kill me, face down, dead
another part of me falls for you

another day in the dark
no, no
stranded in the night
stranded in the cold

don't lock the door on me
you'd kill me, face down, dead
another part of you gone to waste
please hear me out
you kill me, face down, dead
another day in the dark

don't lock the door on me
you'd kill me, face down, dead
another part of you gone to waste
please hear me out
you kill me, face down, dead
another day in the dark

leave the moment alone
leave the moment alone
leave the moment alone
leave the moment alone


i don't mean to dwell
but i can't help myself
when i feel the vibe
and taste a memory
of a time in life
when years seemed to stand still

i close my eyes
and sink within myself
relive the gift of precious memories
in need of a fix called innocence
when did it begin?
the change to come was undetectable
the open wounds expose the importance of
our innocence
a high that can never be bought or sold

symbolic acts, so vivid
yet at the same time
were invisible

savor what you feel and what you see
things that may not seem important now
but may be tomorrow
do you remember when
things seemed so eternal?
heroes were so real
their magic frozen in time
the only way to learn
is be aware and hold on tight

i close my eyes
and sink within myself
relive the gift of precious memories
in need of a fix called innocence
when did it begin?
the change to come was undetectable
the open wounds expose the importance of
our innocence
a high that can never be bought or sold

symbolic acts, so vivid
yet at the same time
were invisible


always locking the doors to your mind
escaping the reality that surrounds you
using faith as an excuse to kill
a sick way of life is now revealed

all the prayers in the world can't help you now
a killer, a taker of life is what you are
speak no more lies
it's your turn to die

preach the good word
speak no more, prepare to burn
a justified torture?
from this may others learn
the life you took
a holy death, a grave mistake
no changing your mind
your life you should pay

practice what you preach
your loved one is now deceased
knowledge is at our hands
never to understand

spiritual healing

blinded by the twisted ways you live
kill for religion, will the lord forgive?
idiocy has stricken your mind
a real life hell you will find

all the prayers in the world can't help you now
a killer, a taker of life is what you are
speak no more lies
it's your turn to die

preach the good word
speak no more, prepare to burn
a justified torture?
from this may others learn
the life you took
a holy death, a grave mistake
no changing your mind
your life you should pay

practice what you preach
your loved one is now deceased
knowledge is at our hands
never to understand

how many times have you woken up and prayed for the rain?
how many times have you seen the papers apportion the blame?
who gets to say?
who gets to work and who gets to play?
i was always told at school, everybody should get the same
how many times have you been told if you don't ask you don't get?
how many lads have taken your money? your mother said you shouldn't bet
who has the fun?
is it always a man with a gun?
someone must have told you if you work too hard you can sweat?
there's always the sun
mmmm
there's always the sun
always, always, always the sun
how many times have the weathermen told you stories that made you laugh?
you know its not unlike the politicians and the leaders, when they do things by halves
who gets the job?
of pushing the knob
that's what responsibility you draw straws for if you're mad enough
there's always the sun
mmmm
there's always the sun
always, always, always the sun
there's always the sun
mmmm
there's always the sun
always, always, always the sun

chante moi une chanson sur une fille qui est partie
dis, est ce qu'elle pourrait  tre moi?
joyeuse dans l'âme, elle navigua en un jour
sur la mer de skye

flot et vent, îles et mers
montagnes de pluie et de soleil
tout ce qui  tait bon, tout ce qui  tait bien
tout ce qui  tait moi, est parti

chante moi une chanson sur une fille qui est partie

no new year's day to celebrate
no chocolate covered candy hearts to give away
no first of spring, no song to sing
in fact here's just another ordinary day

no april rain, no flowers bloom
no wedding saturday within the month of june
but what it is is something new
made up of these three words i say to you

i just called to say i love you
i just called to say how much i care
i just called to say i love you
and i mean it from the bottom of my heart

no summer's high
no warm july
no harvest moon to light one tender august night
no autumn breeze
no falling leaves
not even time for birds to fly to southern skies
no libra sun
no halloween
no giving thanks to all the christmas joy you bring
but what it is, though old so new
to fill your heart like no three words could ever do

i just called to say i love you
i just called to say how much i care
i just called to say i love you
and i mean it from the bottom of my heart

i just called to say i love you
i just called to say how much i care
i just called to say i love you
and i mean it from the bottom of my heart


you gave me such a bad time
tried to hurt me, but now i know

thorn in my side
you know that's all you ever were
a bundle of lies
you know that's all that it was worth
i should have known better
but i trusted you at first
i should have known better
but i got what i deserved
oo woah uwoah woah woah
 oo woah uwoah woah woah 
oo woah uwoah woah woah

 run run, run, run 
to run away from you
 run run, run, run

 run run, run, run 
to run away from you
 run run, run, run 
was all that i could do

thorn in my side
you know that's all you'll ever be
so don't think you know better
'cause that's what you mean to me
i was feeling complicated
i was feeling low
now every time i think of you
i shiver to the bone
oo woah uwoah woah woah
 oo woah uwoah woah woah 
oo woah uwoah woah woah

 run run, run, run

 run run, run, run 
was all that i could do


running through the jungle
way back in '78
here's the story of the people's temple
and my great escape
communing with a madman
the promise of utopia
white nights, suicide drills
shades of things to come
he said

we're gonna mix it up
add the cyanide
then we'll drink it up
you're gonna feel so fine
i said

don't drink the koolaid
don't taste the holy water
don't drink the koolaid
no matter what the preacher   what the preacher says

the day of disaster struck
the murders did begin
his sheep drank it willingly
while mothers force fed their kin
33 escaped this hell
some would call it fate
that's how i lived to tell the tale
about the day he mixed the grape
he said

we're gonna mix it up
add the cyanide
you better drink it up
you're gonna get so high

don't drink the koolaid
don't taste the holy water
don't drink the koolaid
no matter what the preacher says
don't drink the koolaid
don't you down the holy water
don't drink the koolaid
don't believe a word he says

most of the congregation
900 dead
jones found his own way out
a bullet to the head

don't drink the koolaid
don't you taste the holy water
don't drink the koolaid
no matter what the preacher says
don't drink the koolaid
i won't down the holy water
don't drink the koolaid
no matter what the preacher   what the preacher says

i'll bring you the head of the demon
i'm peeling the skin from his face
the life that you lead is inhuman
its cause and effects a disgrace
you're sowing the seeds of a nightmare from hell
your prayers and your demons are tolling the bell
walking through fire, fate's in my hands
waiting for lightning to strike
man on a wire, bearing the brand
waiting for lightning to strike
lightning to strike
twisted dreams that are formed from delusion
the collusion of fear and torment
decimating to stem this contusion
with a power mad freaking intent
you're sowing the seeds of a nightmare from hell
your prayers and your demons lie dead where they fell
walking through fire, fate's in my hands
waiting for lightning to strike
man on a wire, bearing the brand
waiting for lightning to strike
lightning to strike
i'll spin the world around reeling
i have to when mankind's at stake
i might be left broken and bleeding
for it's all in the fight that we make
you're sowing the seeds of a nightmare from hell
your prayers and your demons are tolling the bell
walking through fire, fate's in my hands
waiting for lightning to strike
man on a wire, bearing the brand
waiting for lightning to strike
lightning to strike
lightning will strike 


rosemary
heaven restores you in life
you're coming with me
through the aging, the fearing, the strife
it's the smiling on the package
it's the faces in the sand
it's the thought that moves you upwards
embracing me with two hands
right will take you places
yeah, maybe to the beach
when your friends they do come crying
tell them now your pleasure's set upon slow release

hey, wait
great smile
sensitive to fate, not
denial
but hey, who's on trial?

it took a life span with no cell mate
the long way back
sandy, why can't we look the other way?

he speaks about travel
yeah, we think about the land
we smart like all peoples
feeling real tan
i could take you places
do you need a new man?
wipe the pollen from the faces
make revision to a dream while you wait in the van

hey, wait
great smile
sensitive to fate, not
denial
but hey, who's on trial?

it took a life span with no cell mate
by the long way back
sandy, why can't we look the other way?
you're weightless, you are exotic
you need something for which to care
sandy, why can't we look the other way?

leave some shards under the belly
lay some grease inside my hand
it's a sentimental jury
and the makings of a good plan
you've come to love me lightly
yeah, you come to hold me tight
is this motion ever lasting
or do shudders pass in the night?
rosemary
oh, heaven restores you in life

i spent a life span with no cell mate
the long way back
sandy, why can't we look the other way?
you're weightless, semi erotic
you need someone to take you there
sandy, why can't we look the other way?
why can't we just play the other game?
why can't we just look the other way?


lay where you're laying
don't make a sound
i know they're watching
watching
all the commotion
the kiddie like play
it has people talking
talking

you 
your sex is on fire

the dark of the alley
the breaking of day
head while i'm driving
i'm driving
soft lips are open
them knuckles are pale
feels like you're dying
you're dying

you 
your sex is on fire
consumed 
with what's just transpired

hot as a fever
rattle of bones
i could just taste it
taste it
but it's not forever
but it's just tonight
oh we're still the greatest
the greatest, the greatest

you 
your sex is on fire
you 
your sex is on fire, ahh
consumed 
with what's to transpire
and you 
your sex is on fire
consumed 
with what's to transpire


paranoia is in bloom
the pr transmissions will resume
they'll try to push drugs that keep us all dumbed down
and hope that we will never see the truth around
 so come on 

another promise, another seed
another packaged lie to keep us trapped in greed
and all the green belts wrapped around our minds
and endless red tape to keep the truth confined
 so come on 

they will not force us
they will stop degrading us
they will not control us
we will be victorious
 so come on 

interchanging mind control
come let the revolution take its toll
if you could flick the switch and open your third eye
you'd see that we should never be afraid to die
 so come on 

rise up and take the power back
it's time the fat cats had a heart attack
you know that their time's coming to an end
we have to unify and watch our flag ascend
 so come on 

they will not force us
they will stop degrading us
they will not control us
we will be victorious
 so come on 
hey, hey, hey, hey
hey, hey, hey, hey

they will not force us
they will stop degrading us
they will not control us
we will be victorious
 so come on 


something filled up
my heart with nothing
someone told me not to cry
but now that i'm older
my heart's colder
and i can see that it's a lie

children, wake up
hold your mistake up
before they turn the summer into dust
if the children don't grow up
our bodies get bigger but our hearts get torn up
we're just a million little gods causing rain storms
turning every good thing to rust
i guess we'll just have to adjust

with my lightning bolts a glowing
i can see where i am going to be
when the reaper he reaches and touches my hand
with my lightning bolts a glowing
i can see where i am going
with my lightning bolts a glowing
i can see where i am go going
you better look out below 


some boys hate themselves
spend their lives resenting their fathers
some girls hate their bodies
stand in the mirror and wait for the feedback

saying god, make me famous
if you can't, just make it painless
just make it painless

assisted suicide
she dreams about dying all the time
she told me she came so close
filled up the bathtub and put on our first record

god, make me famous
if you can't, just make it painless
just make it painless

it goes on and on, i don't know what i want
on and on, i don't know if i want it
on and on, i don't know what i want
on and on, i don't know if i want it
 on and on i don't know what i want 
 on and on i don't know if i want it 
 on and on i don't know what i want 
 on and on i don't know if i want it 

some girls hate themselves
hide under the covers with sleeping pills and
some girls cut themselves
stand in the mirror and wait for the feedback
some boys get too much, too much love, too much touch
some boys starve themselves
stand in the mirror and wait for the feedback

creature comfort makes it painless
bury me penniless and nameless
born in a diamond mine
it's all around you but you can't see it
born in a diamond mine
it's all around you but you can't touch it

saying god, make me famous
if you can't, just make it painless
just make it painless

it's not painless
she was a friend of mine, a friend of mine
and we're not nameless, oh

it goes on and on, i don't know what i want

we're the bones under your feet
the white lie of american prosperity
we wanna dance but we can't feel the beat

i'm not knocking your want to carry that home
took it with you when you moved and got it broke
found the pieces, we counted them all alone
didn't add up, forgot to carry a zero
i can't be your apologist very long
i'm surprised that you'd want to carry that on
count your blemishes; you can't, they're all gone
i can't see your response putting them back on
like they're waiting for your guard to fall
so they can see it all and you're so
occupied with what other persons are
occupied with and vice versa
and you've become
what you thought was dumb
a fraction of the sum
yeah, you've become
yeah, you have become
a fraction of the sum
the middle and the front
and now it's coming back
hasn't it come too far?
i was trying to help
but i guess i pushed too hard
now we can't even touch it
afraid it'll fall apart

go back to those gold soundz
and keep my advent to your self
because it's nothing i don't like
is it a crisis or a boring change?
when it's central, so essential
it has a nice ring when you laugh
at the low life opinions
and they're coming to the chorus now
i keep my address to yourself cause we need secrets
we need secret cret cret cret crets back right now
because i never wanna make you feel
that you're social
never ignorant soul
believe in what you wanna do
and do you think that is a major flaw
when they rise up in the falling rain
and if you stay around with your knuckles ground down
the trial's over, the weapon's found
keep my address to myself because it's secret
cause it's secret cret cret cret cret cret cret cret cret cret cret cret cret cret back right now
so drunk in the august sun
and you're the kind of girl i like
because you're empty and i'm empty
and you can never quarantine the past
did you remember in december
that i won't need you when i'm gone
and if i go there, i won't stay there
because i'm sitting here too long
i've been sitting here too long
and i've been wasted
advocating that word for the last word
last words come up all you've got to waste

i hear a voice from the back of the room
i hear a voice cry out
we want something good
well come on a little closer let me see your face
yeah come on a little closer by the front of the stage
i said come on a little closer i got something to say
yeah come on a little closer wanna see your face
you see i met a devil named buena buena
and since i met the devil i ain't been the same, oh no
and i feel alright now i have to tell you
i think it's time for me to finally introduce you to the
buena buena buena buena good good girl
it's comin' to me
yeah it's comin' to me
now i think i know
what it is you need
i know some people wanna make a change
but i know how to make it go away
you see i met a devil named buena buena
and since i met the devil i ain't been the same, oh no
and i feel alright i have to tell you
i think it's time for me to finally introduce you to the
buena buena buena buena good good girl


the rusted chains of prison moons
are shattered by the sun
i walk a road, horizons change
the tournament's begun
the purple piper plays his tune
the choir softly sing
three lullabies in an ancient tongue

for the court of the crimson king, aah
aah, aah

the keeper of the city keys
put shutters on the dreams
i wait outside the pilgrim's door
with insufficient schemes
the black queen chants the funeral march
the cracked brass bells will ring
to summon back the fire witch

to the court of the crimson king, aah
aah, aah

aah, aah
aah, aah

the gardener plants an evergreen
whilst trampling on a flower
i chase the wind of a prism ship
to taste the sweet and sour
the pattern juggler lifts his hand
the orchestra begin
as slowly turns the grinding wheel

in the court of the crimson king, aah
aah, aah


on soft gray mornings widows cry
the wise men share a joke
i run to grasp divining signs
to satisfy the hoax
the yellow jester does not play
but gently pulls the strings
and smiles as the puppets dance

in the court of the crimson king, aah
aah, aah
aah, aah



please remedy my confusion
and thrust me back to the day
the silence of your seclusion
brings night into all you say

pull me down again
and guide me into pain

i'm counting nocturnal hours
drowned visions in haunted sleep
faint flickering of your powers
leaks out to show what you keep

pull me down again
and guide me into...

there is failure inside
this test i can't persist
kept back by the enigma
no criteria is demanded here
deadly patterns made my wreath
prosperous in your ways
pale ghost in the corner
pouring a caress on your shoulder

puzzled by shrewd innocence
runs a thick tide beneath
ushered into inner graves
nails bleeding from the struggle
it is the end for the weak at heart
always the same
a lullaby for the ones who've lost all
reeling inside
my gleaming eye in your necklace reflects
stare of primal regrets
you turn your back and you walk away
never again

spiraling to the ground below
like autumn leaves left in the wake to fade away
waking up to your sound again
and lapse into the ways of misery



standing on the backs of angels
destined to create
mounting the attack
while heroes carry your weight
we spiral toward disaster
survival fading faster

riding out the wave
content to feed off the machine
leading us to death
the new american dream
you're blinded by your hunger
beware, your days are numbered

tears fall from the shameless
shelter me, guide me to the edge of the water
selfless are the righteous
burden me, lead me like a lamb to the slaughter

blurring lines drawn in between
what is right and what is wrong
victims on the radar
straining us along
we're onto your agenda
the dead end road to nowhere

tears fall from the shameless
shelter me, guide me to the edge of the water
selfless are the righteous
burden me, lead me like a lamb to the slaughter


tears fall from the shameless
shelter me, guide me to the edge of the water
selfless are the righteous
burden me, lead me like a lamb to the slaughter
selfless are the righteous
burden me, lead me like a lamb to the slaughter

children are innocent
a teenager's fucked up in the head
adults are even more fucked up
and elderlies are like children
will there be another race
to come along and take over for us?
maybe martians could do
better than we've done
we'll make great pets   x8 
my friend says we're like the dinosaurs
only we are doing ourselves in
much faster than they
ever did
we'll make great pets   x8 
we will make great pets
we'll make great pets   x3 
we will make great pets

today seems like a good day to burn a bridge or two
the one with old wood creaking that would burn right away on cue
i try to be not like that, but some people really suck
some people need to get the axing, chalk it up to bad luck
i know a drugstore cowgirl so afraid of getting bored
she s always running from something, so many things ignored
i might do that stuff if it didn t make me feel like shit
i m on some old reality tip, so many trips in it

beautiful disaster
flyin' down the street again
i tried to keep up
you wore me out and left me ate up
now i wish you all the luck
you re a butterfly in the wind without a care
a pretty train crash to me and i can t care
i do, i don t, whatever

i know a drugstore cowgirl so afraid of getting bored
she s always running from something, so many things ignored
i try to be not like this, but i thought it d make a good song
there s nothing to see, shows over, people just move along

beautiful disaster
flyin' down the street again
i tried to keep up
you wore me out and left me ate up
now i wish you all the luck
you re a butterfly in the wind without a care
a pretty train crash to me and i can t care
i do, i don t, whatever

just sever that leash and release
your freedom of speech
you just have to believe
your deed will be received
somehow somewhere
you won t be repaid with a blank stare
let me know if you dare
there s no one that could cure you like she does, she does
no one could leave you so alone
here it goes, my vibe is holy, my eyes closed
either i m asleep or what i m thinkin is deep
eventually i sigh and kick the sheets
try to piece together why i m here
nothing except my own damn eyes and ears
and then it severs so i listen to my heart
always and ever
if it s not good it might get better
if it s not good it might just sever
i tell you money there s other honey
you always show it but you don t know it
staring at the door thinking
about the mess your in
in your couch sinking deep
over the girl that s gone
just sever that leash and release
your freedom of speech
you just have to believe
your deed will be received
somehow somewhere
you won t be repaid with a blank stare
let me know if you dare
now all you think about her drink about her in vain
but all else feels like you re betraying
we re wakin it up face up and shakin it up
we know of an extended field
this is the deal we re letting and getting
the vibes that we want
open up your heart and proceed to feel
now you re inchin up to the summit never plummet
boot your system up
and then bail with the middle finger up
why you so abrupt baby don t be corrupt
standing in the club playin the wall
that they re not her is all
you think and that is true
but what else can you do
trying to turn back time
or just tow the line
cuz the space you re in
is no place like home

it's been a whole lot easier since the bitch left town
it's been a whole lot happier without her face around
nobody upstairs a gonna stomp and shout
nobody at the back door gonna throw my laundry out
she hold the shotgun while you do si do
she want one man made of hercules and cyrano
it's been a whole lot easier since the bitch is gone

 my lord and lady, we have   fortuitously we happened upon these, er, strolling players, who will provide you with, er, goodly tunes whilst you set about your, errr, prandial delights, albeit in the lamentable absence of your guests.  so, my lord and lady, for your entertainment

static humming panel beaters
freshly day glow'd factory cheaters
salaried and collar scrubbing
he titillated men of action

lights coming up ahead

thoughts like a minefield
i'm a ticking bomb
maybe you should watch your step
don't get lost

the sky is a neighborhood
the sky is a neighborhood
don't get lost

oh, my dear

every time i'm with it alone
it picks me up
you just send me down
i can feel it rushing under my skin
you're a cage won't you let me in?
on my toes
lock the door
pretty face
through the walls
don't know if i'd be so sure again

my eyes are still burning red
so turn the lights out
you're not so hard to forget
with all the lights out

every time i'm stuck in the ground
spin me round, won't you spin me round
you're a void, a crack in the mirror
see me now, if you could see me now
you slipped through
the night
then walked out
skin tight
but you don't matter that much to me
no you don't matter that much to me

my eyes are still burning red
so turn the lights out
you're not so hard to forget
with all the lights out
so turn the lights out
just turn the lights out
my eyes are still burning red
so turn the lights out
you're not so hard to forget
with all the lights out


i'm a puppet on a string
tracy island, time traveling
diamond cutter shaped heartaches
come to find you four in some velvet morning
years too late, she's a silver lining
lone ranger riding through an open space
in my mind when she's not right there beside me

i go crazy 'cause here isn't where i wanna be
and satisfaction feels like a distant memory
and i can't help myself, all i
wanna hear her say is "are you mine?"
well, are you mine?
are you mine?
are you mine? woah, ah

i guess what i'm trying to say is i need the deep end
keep imagining meeting, wished away entire lifetimes
unfair we're not somewhere misbehaving for days
great escape, lost track of time and space
she's a silver lining climbing on my desire

and i go crazy 'cause here isn't where i wanna be
and satisfaction feels like a distant memory
and i can't help myself, all i
wanna hear her say is "are you mine?"
well, are you mine?  are you mine tomorrow? 
are you mine?  or just mine tonight? 
are you mine?  are you mine, mine? 

and the thrill of the chase moves in mysterious ways
so in case, i'm mistaken, i
just wanna hear you say, "you got me, baby
are you mine?"
she's a silver lining
lone ranger riding through an open space
in my mind when she's not right there beside me

i go crazy 'cause here isn't where i wanna be
and satisfaction feels like a distant memory
and i can't help myself, all i
wanna hear her say is "are you mine?"
well, are you mine?  are you mine tomorrow? 
are you mine?  or just mine tonight? 
are you mine?  are you mine tomorrow? 
 or just mine tonight? 


remember the moment you left me alone and
broke every promise you ever made
i was an ocean, lost in the open
nothing could take the pain away

so, you can throw me to the wolves
tomorrow i will come back
leader of the whole pack
beat me black and blue
every wound will shape me
every scar will build my throne 

the sticks and the stones that you used to throw have
built me an empire, so, don t even try
to cry me a river,  cause i forgive you
you are the reason i still fight

so, you can throw me to the wolves
tomorrow i will come back
leader of the whole pack
beat me black and blue
every wound will shape me
every scar will build my throne 
so, you can throw me to the wolves
tomorrow i will come back
leader of the whole pack
beat me black and blue
every wound will shape me
every scar will build my throne

i ll leave you choking
on every word you left unspoken
rebuild all that you ve broken
and now you know
i ll leave you choking
on every word you left unspoken
rebuild all that you ve broken
and now you know

every wound will shape me
every scar will build my throne 
so, you can throw me to the wolves
tomorrow i will come back
leader of the whole pack
beat me black and blue
every wound will shape me
every scar will build my throne


your mind is in touch now, baby
we're losing hard in a broken world
it s like an imaginary girl
it shimmers you in your dream then leaves you cold
all my life, a place to return to
something to hold on
asking you now
do you still remember?

all of those moments you gave me shelter
out of the swelter, out of the sun
into an ocean, under the high tide
howling by your side
until the morning comes
until the morning comes

i want to untie your tongue, girl
i want your love to send me right
i got myself in a world of trouble
and i can't run so i guess i'll fight
for your love, the one thing i return to
holding so tight, i ll put it to you now
for you consideration

all of those moments you gave me shelter
out of the swelter, out of the sun
into an ocean, under the high tide
howling by your side
until the morning comes
until the morning comes

all through the night
so long, side by side
oh, and my heart keeps falling
one more for the ride
somehow always in time
and my heart keeps falling

all of those moments you gave me shelter
out of the swelter, out of the sun
into an ocean, under the high tide
howling by your side
until the morning comes
until the morning comes


say your prayers, little one
don't forget, my son
to include everyone
i tuck you in, warm within
keep you free from sin
until the sandman he comes

sleep with one eye open
gripping your pillow tight

exit light
enter night
take my hand
we're off to never never land

something's wrong, shut the light
heavy thoughts tonight
and they aren't of snow white
dreams of war
dreams of liars
dreams of dragons fire
and of things that will bite, yeah

sleep with one eye open
gripping your pillow tight

exit light
enter night
take my hand
we're off to never never land


now i lay me down to sleep

and
if i die before i wake
 if i die before i wake 
pray the lord my soul to take
 pray the lord my soul to take 

hush, little baby, don't say a word
and never mind that noise you heard
it's just the beast under your bed
in your closet, in your head

exit light

hangin' around, hittin' the ground, dead in the water
suckin' it up, fuckin' it up, a favorite daughter
takin' a swing, everything goin' 'round in circles
takin' a hit, this is it, i'm over it

i can't quit
i'm over it

shutting it up, cutting me up with broken glasses
heaven above, been learning to love in evening classes
get a new man and go to work out with your sister
talk in a bit, but this it, i'm over it

i can't quit
i'm over it
i can't quit
i'm over it

you can't change me, can you?
you can't offer that much to me
oh you can't offer change, can you?
and i can't offer that much to you

havin' it out, livin' in doubt with no defenses
tighten the rope, and talkin' of hope in different tenses
callin' my friends and tellin' the only one that answers
it's hard to admit, but this it, i'm over it

i can't quit
i'm over it
 i'm so dramatic 
i can't quit
 i'm so dramatic, i panicked 

you can't change me, can you?
you can't offer that much to me
oh you can't offer change, can you?
and i can't offer that much to you

i can't quit
 i'm so dramatic 
i'm over it
 hangin' around, go underground down in my basement 
i can't quit
 suckin' it up, fuckin' it up with your replacement 
i'm over it
 takin' a swing, everything goin' round in circles 
i can't quit
 takin' a hit, this it 
i'm over it


i flew beyond the sun before it was time
burning all the gold that held me inside my shell
waiting for you to pull me back in
i almost had the world in my sight

lost love, bright eyes fading
faster than stars falling
how can i tell you that i've failed?
tell you i failed

falling from grace cause i've been away too long
leaving you behind with my lonesome song
now i'm lost in oblivion

i tried to burrow a hole into the ground
breaking all the fingers and the nails from my hands
the eyes of a child see no wrong
ignorant bliss, impending doom

lost love, bright eyes fading
faster than stars falling
how can i tell you that i've failed?
tell you i failed

falling from grace cause i've been away too long
leaving you behind with my lonesome song
now i'm lost
falling from grace cause i've been away too long
leaving you behind with my lonesome song
now i'm lost in oblivion


falling from grace cause i've been away too long
leaving you behind with my lonesome song
now i'm lost
falling from grace cause i've been away too long
leaving you behind with my lonesome song
now i'm lost in oblivion

in oblivion
in oblivion

headquarters:  the testimony regarding similar acts sets forth detailed accounts of tortuous treatment that are almost identical to the torture suffered by andrew wilson. the testimony reveals an astounding pattern or plan on the part of respondents  to torture certain suspects, often with substantial criminal records, into confessing to crimes
or to condone such activity. 24 memorandum in opposition to motion to bar testimony concerning other alleged victims of police misconduct, p. 1.
110. in their memorandum in opposition, specially appointed city of chicago lawyers,
on behalf of superintendent leroy martin and the city of chicago, identified the  seven
additional victims of torture tactics at area ii headquarters  as melvin jones, anthony holmes,
george powell, donald white, shadeed mumin, leroy orange, and lawrence poree. id., pp. 7 
14.
111. in their memorandum in opposition, specially appointed city of chicago lawyers,
on behalf of martin and the city, made the following judicial admission       that the similar acts
testimony of melvin jones, anthony holmes, george powell, donald white, shadeed mumin,
leroy orange, and lawrence poree
s highly probative of the modus operandi used or condoned in the torturing of suspects
to elicit statements. respondents  methods of torture
through electric shock, bagging, and holding a gun to a suspect s head are more that
sufficiently unique to establish a modus operandi for 404 b purposes. in addition, the
testimony establishes a pattern of and plan to torture these suspects in these similar ways
to elicit confessions to violent crimes.
id. p. 17.
112. in their memorandum in opposition, specially appointed city of chicago lawyers,
on behalf of martin and the city, judicially admitted that the similar acts testimony of melvin
jones, anthony holmes, george powell, donald white, shadeed mumin, leroy orange, and
lawrence poree:
clearly establishes respondents   motive and intent in
torturing or condoning the torture of wilson. respondents generally engaged in these
similar practices in order to coerce a confession to a serious crime.
id. p. 22. 25
113. in their memorandum in opposition, specially appointed city of chicago lawyers,
on behalf of martin and the city, judicially admitted that the similar acts testimony of melvin
jones, anthony holmes, george powell, donald white, shadeed mumin, leroy orange, and
lawrence poree:
shows the physical existence of one or more electric shock devices at area ii, prior to
and subsequent to wilson s arrest, and burge s possession of and familiarity with the use
of the devices. it is also admissible to show knowledge of that technique and of the
bagging technique, about which respondents deny knowing, and the technique of putting
a gun to the head of a victim.
id., p. 24.
114. in their memorandum in opposition, specially appointed city of chicago lawyers,
on behalf of martin and the city, made the following judicial admission:
there is no question that the similarities between  wilson s testimony
and the similar victims  testimony is more than sufficient to meet the 404 b standard.
burge was the main perpetrator of the torture in almost all of the cases, and, when he was
not the principal, he was still involved. in the case of all but one of the victims, the
victim was picked up and taken to area ii where he was then interrogated regarding his
knowledge or involvement in a serious offense. although donald white was taken
instead to area i, he was taken there and interrogated by area ii detectives. all of the
victims were black and generally had significant criminal histories.
also similar was the way in which several victims were threatened with
consequences if they refused to make a statement. after an initial refusal, the
punishment would begin and then would become stronger and more painful as the
refusals to speak persisted. the most striking similarities, however, are found in the
methods of torture used on the suspects. wilson was electro shocked by yucaitis using
the black box and by burge who used the black box and a curling iron looking device,
was  bagged  and beaten, and was threatened with a gun placed in his mouth. jones,
holmes, poree, powell and orange were similarly electro shocked by burge. holmes,
powell, white and mumin were all  bagged  and beaten to the point where they lost or
almost lost consciousness. burge pointed a cocked gun at jones s head, hit poree in the
head with a pistol, and placed a revolver containing one bullet at mumin s head and
snapped it three times slowly. white had a gun placed in his mouth. additionally, each
of the victims was slapped around and punched.
burge s statements to the victims were also very similar. burge told both jones
and mumin that nobody would ever believe their word against his. as he did in relation
to wilson, he referred to the absence of marks on mumin s body. he said  fun time  as 26
he approached wilson and poree with the black box, and laughed when he bagged
mumin. he told wilson he would  fry his black ass  and jones he would  blow his
black head off. 
as the case law cited above aptly demonstrates, these actions or the condoning of
these actions are overwhelming in their similarity.
id., pp. 25 26.
115. in their memorandum in opposition, specially appointed city of chicago lawyers,
on behalf of chicago police superintendent leroy martin and the city of chicago, made the
following judicial admission:
given the similarities between the serious offenses charged and the offenses to which the
similar victims will testify, there is no question that the offenses are close enough in time
to be relevant to this case. tak the offenses in sequence, they reveal a pattern of
almost identical acts of torture directed towards persons suspected of violent crimes.
while the sequence spans twelve years, each offense is close enough to the next to
connect it to the relevant pattern of behavior. moreover, melvin jones  and donald
white s testimony will demonstrate that they were tortured just days before andrew
wilson was tortured.
id., p. 28.
116. in their memorandum in opposition, specially appointed city of chicago lawyers,
on behalf of leroy martin and the city of chicago, judicially admitted:
indeed, as the testimony of the similar victims shows, respondents [burge, yucaitis and
o hara] counted on the fact that their testimony would be believed over that of a convict
when they persisted in their pattern of torture.
id., p. 28.
117. in a document filed in the case of wilson v. city of chicago, jon burge, patrick
o hara and john yucaitis, 86 c 2360, entitled  city of chicago s memorandum in response
to plaintiff andrew wilson s motion for summary judgment,  the city, through its lawyers,
made the following judicial admission:
plaintiff andrew wilson has testified that he was beaten, kicked, punched, burned by
being harnessed to a radiator, and repeatedly electro shocked on his hands, face, ears, and 27
between his legs by defendant police officers. plaintiff now seeks summary judgment that
this outrageous conduct, unsanctioned and condemned by the city, and for which
defendant officers were fired and or disciplined, was within the defendants  scope of
employment.

118. in a document filed in the case of wilson v. city of chicago, 86 c 2360, entitled
 city of chicago s memorandum in response to plaintiff andrew wilson s motion for
summary judgment,  the city, through its lawyers, made the following judicial admission:
the instrumentalities by which defendants tortured plaintiff also illustrate that defendant
officers were not in the scope of their employment. plaintiff has failed to furnish any
evidence to suggest that the instruments used by the officers to shock him      the black
box device and the modified curling iron     were furnished by the city.
id., p. 17.
119. in its memorandum in response to plaintiff andrew wilson s motion for
summary judgment,  the city, through its lawyers, made the judicial admission that
burge  cruelly torture  andrew wilson and  denie him necessary medical
assistance. 
id., p. 19.
120. in this memorandum, the city, through its lawyers, made the following admission
concerning it change of position from defending burge for his alleged torture of andrew wilson
to asserting that said torture was so outrageous as to be outside the scope of burge s
employment:  the change in the city s position was the result of inquiries undertaken by the
city in good faith and in the public interest.  id. p. 12.
121. on july 30, 1992, almost two years after superintendent martin had first received
the goldston findings, the police foundation submitted its report to superintendent of police
matt rodriguez. after noting that because  hangings, shockings,  baggings  beatings, chokings,
and beatings were alleged to occur, many in the area 2 headquarters itself, a thorough and
rigorous investigation seemed required,  and that it passed no judgment as to whether the torture
alleged had in fact took place, the report criticized goldston s methodology. police foundation 28

questions by alderman rush:
q: all right. mr. fogel, what have you done to discourage, well, first of all do you
acknowledge the fact that there is a code of silence that exists in the chicago 75
police department?
a: in all professions.
q: okay. and its, do you acknowledge      
a: including, including the chicago police department.
city council hearing, committee on police, fire an municipal institutions, public
hearing on police brutality, day 5, october 11, 1989, p. 285.
357. on october 11, 1989, police superintendent leroy martin testified before the

caldwell:
q: one final question, superintendent, and this was asked of dr. fogel on
numerous occasions. it has to do with the suggested code of silence among
police officers. as superintendent of chicago s police department, do you
agree or      
a: yes.
q: do you agree that there is in fact in force and functioning a code of silence
among police officers?
a: to some extent, yes, sir.
id., pp. 368 69.
358. on or about october 19, 1987, ops director fogel sent a document entitled
 proposed revamping of office of professional standards,  to the mayor of the city of chicago
in which he wrote:
by accepting all cases, even erring on the liberal side, to be accommodative to the
public, ops gives the appearance of moving forward on all complaints. the opposite
occurs. the appearance of doing a thorough investigation with full due process
and endless unnecessary reviews for all, actually operates to immunize police
from internal discipline, increases their overtime, leads to an enormous  paper storm 
and has institutionalized lying.

360. in jones v. city of chicago, 856 f. 2d 985,  7th cir. 1987  the seventh circuit 76
court of appeals affirmed a jury verdict against area 2 violent crimes detectives, supervisors
and commanding officers, including detectives james houtsma, dennis mcguire, john mccabe,
and raymond mcnally, sgt. alvin palmer, lt. griffith, and commander milton deas, for
conspiracy to  railroad  18 year old george jones for a 1981 murder, stating:
we cannot say that the jury acted unreasonably in finding that all of the
individual defendants were voluntary participants in a common venture to
railroad george jones.
jones v. city of chicago, 856 f. 2d at 992.
361. in jones v. city of chicago, the seventh circuit affirmed a jury verdict against the
city of chicago for maintaining a  street files custom or policy which led to the railroading of
18 year old george jones for a 1981 murder, stating:
the custom in question is the maintenance of the "street files," police
files withheld from the state's attorney and therefore unavailable as a
source of exculpatory information that might induce him not to prosecute
or, failing that, would at least be available to defense counsel under
brady v. maryland, 373 u.s. 83, 10 l. ed. 2d 215, 83 s. ct. 1194  1963 . as
we noted recently, information undermining the credibility of a government
witness is within the scope of brady's rule. see united states v.
herrera medina, 853 f.2d 564, slip op. at 5  7th cir. 1988 .
although the lawfulness of the street files practice has never been
adjudicated, the city, which has abandoned the practice, does not challenge
the jury's implicit finding that it denied criminal defendants due process
of law. brady v. maryland does not require the police to keep written
records of all their investigatory activities; but attempts to circumvent
the rule of that case by retaining records in clandestine files
deliberately concealed from prosecutors and defense counsel cannot be
tolerated. the city sensibly does not attempt to defend such behavior in
this court.
there is little doubt that the clandestine character of the street files
played a role in jones's misfortunes. cf. harris v. city of pagedale, 821
f.2d 499, 507  8th cir. 1987 . if the state's attorney had had 
access to them, he would have discovered memos by kelly and especially by
laverty that would have given any prosecutor pause. alternatively, defense 77
counsel would have obtained them prior to trial and the trial would have
ended even sooner than it did. the only question is whether this custom was
a custom of the city of chicago. as the custom was department wide
and of long standing, the jury was entitled to conclude that it had been
consciously approved at the highest policy making level for decisions
involving the police department    the standard suggested by the recent
plurality opinion in city of st. louis v. praprotnik, 485 u.s. 112, 108 s.
ct. 915, 99 l. ed. 2d 107  1988 . see also stokes v. bullins, 844 f.2d 269,
273  5th cir. 1988 .

we write as a group of public officials, citizens and organizations concerned with
police violence and discipline to urge you to immediately reopen and review several
office of professional standards  ops  investigations into police torture, and to open
investigations in numerous other torture cases where no ops investigations have been
conducted. we further urge you to commission an independent investigation into the
obvious violations of police regulations and procedure and legal process by certain ops
and police officials during the torture investigations which were conducted by the ops.
august 2, 1999 letter from citizens alert, mary powers et. al. to hillard, carney, and baird.
588. in the august 2, 1999 letter, the signators further wrote: 113
recent news articles and publicly released documents and depositions reveal that the
ops reopened nine torture investigations in 1992 and 1993 as a result of prior ops
findings that physical abuse of african american suspects at area 2 from 1973 to 1986
included "psychological techniques and planned torture," was "systematic," and
"methodical," and that area 2 command members, particularly jon burge, "were aware
of the systematic abuse and perpetuated it either by actively participating in same or
failing to take any action to bring it to an end." goldston report, pp 2 3. the now public
evidence further reveals that ops investigators tillman, lawrence, and cosey conducted
thorough investigations in each of these cases, discovered new evidence not available
during the initial investigations, and sustained findings in six of the cases. the sustained
findings included findings that victims were electric shocked, suffocated with a plastic
bag, suspended in air by their handcuffs, beaten and stomped, and racially abused. the
evidence further shows that these sustained findings were entered against several police
officers who were and are still chicago police officers in good standing, most notably
lieutenant peter dignan, who had allegations of torture and abuse sustained against him
in five of the six cases. the evidence further reveals that these findings and the
investigative files were tendered to ops director gayle shines in 1994 for her review,
and that she overturned the findings in four of the cases in late 1994 and early 1995, at
the same time that peter dignan was nominated by the mayor and the department for
merit promotion to lieutenant. ms. shines has admitted that in the approximately 2500
sustained cases which she reviewed during her eight year career as director, she
overturned a total of 10 cases, including these four against dignan.
the evidence further shows that in the other two cases, darrell cannon and stanley
howard, ms. shines never completed her review of the sustained findings of torture, but
rather kept these files in her office for four years, together with the other seven files.
cannon, who was on trial in a murder case, and howard, who is on death row, sought
these files by subpoena, but shines and the department failed to produce these files,
which contained highly exculpatory evidence. furthermore, after ms. shines left the ops
in 1998, counsel to the superintendent, thomas needham, obtained the nine torture files
from the ops and, without consultation with the superintendent, summarily reversed the
sustained findings and closed the cases. needham, who, as a longtime assistant state s
attorney, was closely connected to the prosecution of several torture victims, including
cannon, admitted that his summary reversals of the torture findings were not based on
the merits of the cases, but rather on the fact that the files had languished in shines 
office for so long a period of time. the superintendent never reviewed these cases on the
merits as he is required by police procedure to do, and he only learned of his counsel s
unjustifiable actions by reading about them in a february 1999 chicago tribune article.
additionally, the public evidence reveals that the ops failed to investigate numerous
additional documented cases of police torture against african american suspects. in the
case of melvin jones, mary powers of citizen s alert specifically requested by a letter
dated july 26, 1989 that the ops open an investigation into the recently revealed
allegations that jones was electric shocked at by jon burge and several other area 2
detectives who remain on the force to this day. contrary to police and ops procedure, no
investigation was ever opened, despite the fact that the city has subsequently admitted in 114
official court papers that jones was in fact tortured. similarly, in the shadeed mumin
case, an investigation was opened and ops investigators developed compelling new
evidence that he was tortured by burge and an unidentified detective. just as the ops
investigator was about to identify this officer, the ops discontinued the investigation,
supposedly because the investigation had not been assigned a complaint register number.
in numerous other cases, including aaron patterson and nine other men who are
presently on death row as a result of confessions which they allege were tortured from
them, the ops has failed to conduct any investigation whatsoever into these most serious
allegations.
id.
589. in the august 2, 1999 letter, the signators made the following demands:
1. given ms. shines  clear misconduct, lack of objectivity, and failure to complete her
review of the cannon and howard sustained findings, that new ops director, callie
baird, conduct an independent review on the merits of the six sustained torture
cases;
2. if ms. baird concurs with one or more of the sustained findings, that the
superintendent fully and fairly review those findings on the merits, as he is required by
police procedure to do;
3. that counsel thomas needham be disqualified from any role in reviewing or
otherwise participating in any torture investigations;
4. that peter dignan and any other active officers against whom torture findings were
entered by ops investigators be suspended pending complete review;
5. that the department and its ops open an investigation into the allegations that melvin
jones was electric shocked by jon burge and other still active detectives and consider
in making its findings that the city has admitted that jones was in fact tortured;
6. that the department and its ops reopen and complete the shadeed mumin
investigation;

594. in an e mail dated 1 10 02, corporation counsel mara s. georges wrote to her
assistant:  sheila o grady would like us to explore bringing an action against burge. will you
please think about it and give us your thoughts?   new documents report that city considered
suing burge, city continues paying for fired commander s legal defense,  nbc 5.com.,
4 29 04.
595. on january 1, 2002, sheila o grady was mayor daley s chief of staff. id.
596. in response, jeffrey given, georges  assistant, wrote that suing burge  would
seem to undercut our ability to defend  suit by challenging the underlying
facts . . .   city considered suing burge; officials weighed their options to fight growing
uproar over torture allegations against the fired police commander,  chicago tribune,
4 29 04.
597. mindful that the torture allegations were gaining new momentum, given and
georges also considered mounting a public relations campaign to counter continuing negative
publicity about burge and the city s role in the torture scandal. id.
598. given and georges recognized that the campaign would not be easy for a wide
variety of reasons, including that some of burge s men were still on the police force, the
department had been embarrassed by needham s unilateral shelving of the ops torture
investigations despite the investigators  sustained findings, and that the tribune s then recent
series on the continuing cpd practice of obtaining false confessions had again focused attention
on the issue, and given further stated  but query how we ll do in the court of public opinion
after a long, public, expensive and embarrassing discovery process?  nbc5.com; chicago
tribune.
599. instead of suing burge, or otherwise distancing the city from him, the city decided 117
to invest unlimited public funds in representing burge and at least thirty five other area 2
detectives accused of torture and abuse in the four torture cases and to fight production and
public disclosure of additional documents that would further expose the city s central role in the
torture scandal in civil and criminal cases and with the special prosecutor. id.
600. on august 27, 2004 in his sworn testimony before the prisoner review board,
former area 2 commander and superintendent leroy martin falsely denied that he did not have
contemporaneous knowledge of the allegations of torture and abuse against jon burge and other
area 2 detectives while he was commander. tr. of 8 27 04 parole revocation hearing of darrell
cannon.
601. in her concurring opinion in hinton v. uchtman  sub. nom. ___f 3d ___  7th cir.
2005 , seventh circuit court of appeals judge diane wood found:
he claim hinton has made regarding his confession illustrates dramatically the
high price our system of criminal justice pays when police abuse runs rampant: a
cloud hangs over everything that the bad actors touched . . .  mountain of
evidence indicates that torture was an ordinary occurrence at the area two station
of the chicago police department during the exact time period pertinent to
hinton's case. eventually, as this sorry tale came to light, the office of
professional standards investigation of the police department looked into the
allegations, and it issued a report that concluded that police torture under the
command of lt. jon burge   the officer in charge of hinton's case   had been a
regular part of the system for more than ten years. and, in language reminiscent
of the news reports of 2004 concerning the notorious abu ghraib facility in iraq,
the report said that "he type of abuse described was not limited to the usual
beating, but went into such esoteric areas as psychological techniques and
planned torture." the report detailed specific cases, such as the case of andrew
wilson, who was taken to area two on february 14, 1982. there a group led by
burge beat wilson, stuffed a bag over his head, handcuffed him to a radiator, and
repeatedly administered electric shocks to his ears, nose, and genitals. see people
v. wilson, 506 n.e.2d 571  ill. 1987 . burge eventually lost his job with the
police, though not until 1992. see in the matter of the charges filed against jon
burge, no. 91 1856  chicago police board, february 11, 1993 . to this day,
burge has not been prosecuted for any of these actions, though it appears that he
at least thinks that he may still be at some risk of prosecution. see, for example, 118
"cop brutality probe must be thorough, fair," chi. sun times, may 16, 2002
 editorial ; hal dardick, "burge repeatedly takes 5th; former police commander
stays mum on torture questions," chi. tribune, sept. 2, 2004  noting allegations
that burge or people reporting to him had tortured 108 black and latino suspects
between august 1972 and september 1991 . . . .
behavior like that attributed to burge imposes a huge cost on society: it
creates distrust of the police generally, despite the fact that most police officers
would abhor such tactics, and it creates a cloud over even the valid convictions in
which the problem officer played a role. indeed, the alleged conduct is so
extreme that, if proven, it would fall within the prohibitions established by the
united nations convention against torture  "cat" , which defines torture as
"any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is
intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a
third person information or a confession . . .," thereby violating the fundamental
human rights principles that the united states is committed to uphold. . . .


you used to get it in your fishnets
now you only get it in your night dress
discarded all the naughty nights for niceness
landed in a very common crisis
everything's in order in a black hole
nothing seems as pretty as the past though
that bloody mary's lacking in tabasco
remember when you used to be a rascal?

oh, the boy's a slag, the best you ever had
the best you ever had is just a memory and those dreams
but not as daft as they seem, not as daft as they seem
my love, when you dream them up

flicking through a little book of sex tips
remember when the boys were all electric?
now when she's told she's gonna get it
i'm guessing that she'd rather just forget it
clinging to not getting sentimental
said she wasn't going but she went still
likes her gentlemen not to be gentle
was it a mecca dauber or a betting pencil?

oh, the boy's a slag, the best you ever had
the best you ever had is just a memory and those dreams
weren't daft as they seem, not as daft as they seem
my love, when you dream them up
oh, flo, where did you go?
where did you go? where did you go?

you're falling about
you took a left off last laugh lane
just sounding it out
but you're not coming back again
you're falling about

on a cobweb afternoon in a room full of emptiness
by a freeway, i confess i was lost in the pages
of a book full of death, reading how we'll die alone
and if we're good, we'll lay to rest anywhere we want to go

in your house, i long to be
room by room, patiently
i'll wait for you there, like a stone
i'll wait for you there, alone

and on my deathbed, i will pray to the gods and the angels
like a pagan to anyone who will take me to heaven
to a place i recall, i was there so long ago
the sky was bruised, the wine was bled, and there you led me on

in your house, i long to be
room by room, patiently
i'll wait for you there, like a stone
i'll wait for you there, alone, alone

and on i read, until the day was gone
and i sat in regret of all the things i've done
for all that i've blessed, and all that i've wronged
in dreams until my death, i will wander on

in your house, i long to be
room by room, patiently
i'll wait for you there, like a stone
i'll wait for you there, alone, alone


hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo

i ain't happy, i'm feeling glad
i got sunshine in a bag
i'm useless, but not for long
the future is coming on
i ain't happy, i'm feeling glad
i got sunshine in a bag
i'm useless, but not for long
the future is coming on
it's coming on, it's coming on
it's coming on, it's coming on

finally, someone let me out of my cage
now, time for me is nothing, 'cause i'm countin' no age
nah, i couldn't be there, now you shouldn't be scared
i'm good at repairs, and i'm under each snare
intangible, bet you didn't think, so i command you to
panoramic view, look, i'll make it all manageable
pick and choose, sit and lose, all you different crews
chicks and dudes, who you think is really kickin' tunes?
picture you getting down in a picture tube
like you lit the fuse, you think it's fictional?
mystical? maybe, spiritual hero
who appears in you to clear your view when you're too crazy?
lifeless to those, the definition for what life is
priceless to you, because i put you on the hype shit
you like it? gun smokin', righteous with one toke
get psychic among those, possess you with one go

i ain't happy, i'm feeling glad
i got sunshine in a bag
i'm useless, but not for long
the future is coming on
i ain't happy, i'm feeling glad
i got sunshine in a bag
i'm useless, but not for long
the future is coming on  that's right 
it's coming on, it's coming on
it's coming on, it's coming on

the essence, the basics, without it, you make it
allow me to make this childlike in nature
rhythm, you have it or you don't, that's a fallacy
i'm in them, every sproutin' tree, every child of peace
every cloud and sea, you see with your eyes
i see destruction and demise, corruption in disguise  that's right 
from this fuckin' enterprise, now i'm sucked into your lies
through russel, not his muscles
but percussion he provides for me as a guide, y'all can see me now
'cause you don't see with your eye, you perceive with your mind
that's the inner  fuck 'em  so i'ma stick around with russ and be a mentor
bust a few rhymes so motherfuckers remember
where the thought is, i brought all this
so you can survive when law is lawless  right here 
feelings, sensations that you thought was dead
no squealing and remember that it's all in your head

i ain't happy, i'm feeling glad
i got sunshine in a bag
i'm useless, but not for long
the future is coming on
i ain't happy, i'm feeling glad
i got sunshine in a bag
i'm useless, but not for long
my future is coming on
it's coming on, it's coming on
it's coming on, it's coming on

my future is coming on
it's coming on, it's coming on
it's coming on, it's coming on
my future

it's coming on, it's coming on
it's coming on, it's coming on

it's coming on, it's coming on
my future
it's coming on, it's coming on
it's coming on
my future
it's coming on, it's coming on
my future

broken sticks and broken stones
will turn to dust just like our bones
it's words that hurt the most now isn't it
are you sad inside, are you home alone
if i could just pick up the phone
maybe you could see a better day
and you won't waste away
under my watchful eye
because i'm your hero and you're my weakness
who's gonna break my fall
when the spinning starts
the colors bleed together and fade
was it ever there at all
or have i lost my way
the path of least resistance
is catching up with me again today
i'm broken down, not good enough
the broken promises add up
to twice their weight in tears which i have caused
i'm afraid to sink, i'm afraid to swim
i'm sad to say i miss my friends
i know that i'm supposed to step away
but they need me to stay and keep a watchful eye
on all my heroes and all their demons
but who's gonna break my fall
when the spinning starts
the colors bleed together and fade
was it ever there at all
or have i lost my way
the path of least resistance
is catching up with me again
not today
not today
was it ever there at all
and have i lost my way
the path of least resistance
is catching up with me again today
broken sticks and broken stones
will turn to dust just like our bones again today
i'm broken down
not good enough
the broken promises add up again today
was it ever there at all
and have i lost my way
the path of least resistance
is catching up with me again today

it was 1989, my thoughts were short my hair was long
caught somewhere between a boy and man
she was seventeen and she was far from in between
it was summertime in northern michigan
ahh ahh ahh
ahh ahh ahh

splashing through the sand bar
talking by the campfire
it's the simple things in life, like when and where
we didn't have no internet
but man, i never will forget
the way the moonlight shined upon her hair

and we were trying different things
we were smoking funny things
making love out by the lake to our favorite song
sipping whiskey out the bottle, not thinking 'bout tomorrow
singing sweet home alabama all summer long
singing sweet home alabama all summer long

catching wild life from the dock
watching the waves roll off the rocks
she'll forever hold a spot inside my soul
we'd blister in the sun
we couldn't wait for night to come
to hit that sand and play some rock and roll

while we were trying different things
we were smoking funny things
making love out by the lake to our favorite song
sipping whiskey out the bottle, not thinking 'bout tomorrow
singing sweet home alabama all summer long
singing sweet home alabama all summer long

now nothing seems as strange as when the leaves began to change
or how we thought those days would never end
sometimes i'll hear that song and i'll start to sing along
and think man i'd love to see that girl again

and we were trying different things

ira hayes
ira hayes

call him drunken ira hayes
he won't answer anymore
not the whiskey drinking indian
nor the marine that went to war

gather round me people there's a story i would tell
about a brave young indian you should remember well
from the land of the pima indian
a proud and noble band
who farmed the phoenix valley in arizona land
down the ditches for a thousand years
the water grew ira's peoples' crops
until the white man stole the water rights
and the sparkling water stopped
now ira's folks were hungry
and their land grew crops of weeds
when war came, ira volunteered
and forgot the white man's greed

call him drunken ira hayes
he won't answer anymore
not the whiskey drinking indian
nor the marine that went to war

there they battled up iwo jima's hill
two hundred and fifty men
but only twenty seven lived to walk back down again

and when the fight was over
and when old glory raised
among the men who held it high
was the indian, ira hayes

call him drunken ira hayes
he won't answer anymore
not the whiskey drinking indian
nor the marine that went to war

ira returned a hero
celebrated through the land
he was wined and speeched and honored
everybody shook his hand

but he was just a pima indian
no water, no home, no chance
at home nobody cared what ira'd done
and when the indians dance

call him drunken ira hayes
he won't answer anymore
not the whiskey drinking indian
nor the marine that went to war

then ira started drinking hard
jail was often his home
they'd let him raise the flag and lower it
like you'd throw a dog a bone 
he died drunk one morning
alone in the land he fought to save
two inches of water in a lonely ditch
was a grave for ira hayes

call him drunken ira hayes
he won't answer anymore
not the whiskey drinking indian
nor the marine that went to war

yeah, call him drunken ira hayes
but his land is just as dry
and his ghost is lying thirsty
in the ditch where ira died


well it's floodin' down in texas

you want to grow up to paint houses like me
a trailer in my yard till you're twenty three

a 302 mach one in green

and i sold it to buy her a ring

and i learned not to say much of nothing

don t call what you're wearing an outfit
don t ever say your car is broke

and i went back to painting for my old man
and i guess that s what i ll always do

and don t try to be who you ain t
and don t let me catch you in kendale
with a bucket of wealthy man s paint

don t call what you're wearing an outfit

don t sing with a fake british accent
don t act like your family s a joke

i can't recall the last time i was caught between the walls
those razors in the pillowcases seem to cut 'em all
but old foes, dead things, take a toll
remember, it's just a game

been a long time since i rock and rolled
it's only rock and roll but i like it, like it
don't talk   walk, don't feel   real
don't stay   say, you'll need it anyway

oh, it's my own damn fault
i guess it's good to be the enemy
that don't mean it ain't so bad, bad, bad
because it's all downhill from here, motherfucker
it's all downhill from here  motherfucker 
it's all downhill from here
it's all downhill, you can't get home from here

your beast is just a burden that you never keep in line
this 'fabulous' is really less, gets 'em every time
you roll your eyes for money, don't act like you're impressed
you spread your legs for tv time, baby, who fucks you best?

been a long time since i rock and rolled
it's only rock and roll but i like it, like it

aside the wandering eye has opened
a stare all the way bare and broken
the start of a brand new adventure
hey now
catch me quick before i walk away
tell me if there's something i should say
i'll find the quiet corners and the empty spaces
not far a blue guitar is playing
it drew me like it knew
and it's saying
hey now
catch me quick before i walk away
tell me if there's something i should say
i'll find the quiet corners and the empty spaces
we drown in ups and downs
neglecting
the beauty of my sun is setting
in the end there's no way in redemption
hey now
catch me quick before i walk away
tell me if there's something i should say
i'll find the quiet corners and the empty spaces
hey now
catch me quick before i walk away
tell me if there's something i should say


we got style and we got grace
we run wild and never dance alone
in this town, she s fucking famous
but this town will never be her home
the sun sets on a promise kept
i try

but i don t need this modern love
this modern love
oh it always lets me down
 oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh 
this modern love
this modern love
oh it always lets me down
 oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh 

the popularity trap strikes again
you don t need these fools cause you re incroyable
 which is french for incredible 
we found solace at the star and garter
no malice, i can feel you coming alive
ignore the warning signs
and we try

but i don t need this modern love
this modern love
oh it always lets me down
 oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh 
this modern love
this modern love
oh it always lets me down
it lets me down

alright
a bare mattress, a lockless door
two withington hearts on a pique assiette floor
give me back those awkward exchanges
the fumbles in bathtubs
when we were just strangers
we talk about your graduation
and the realisation that we might not be together forever and ever, amen

wide eyed and up all night
this could be good
but i don't want to shy away
i hear them say, "romance is dead"
and i don't need this

modern love
this modern love
oh it always, it lets me down
 oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh 
oh, it lets me down
this modern love
this modern love
oh it always, it lets me down
it lets me down
it lets me down
it lets me down
alright

why'd you feel so underrated?
why'd you feel so negated?

turning away from the light, becoming adult
turning into myself
i wanted to bite not destroy, to feel her underneath
turning into the light

she don't think straight
no, no, no, she don't think straight
she's got such a dirty mind and it never ever stops
and you don't taste like her and you never ever will
and we don't read the papers, we don't read the news
heaven's never enough, we will never be fooled

turning away from the light, becoming adult
turning into myself
i wanted to bite not destroy, to feel her underneath
turning into the light

and if you feel a little left behind
we will wait for you on the other side

bows and flows of angel hair
and ice cream castles in the air
and feathered canyons everywhere
i've looked at clouds that way
but now they only block the sun
they rain and they snow on everyone
so many things i would have done
but clouds got in my way
i've looked at clouds from both sides now
from up and down and still somehow
it's cloud's illusions i recall
i really don't know clouds at all
moons and junes and ferris wheels
the dizzy dancing way you feel
when every fairy tale comes real
i've looked at love that way
but now it's just another show
you leave 'em laughin when you go
and if you care don't let them know
don't give yourself away
i've looked at love from both sides now
from win and lose and still somehow
it's love's illusions i recall
i really don't know love at all
tears and fears and feeling proud
to say, "i love you" right out loud
dreams and schemes and circus crowds
i've looked at life that way
but now old friends are acting strange
they shake their heads, they say i've changed
well something's lost but something's gained
in living every day
i've looked at life from both sides now
from win and lose and still somehow
it's life's illusions i recall
i really don't know life at all

sometimes i feel like i don't have a partner
sometimes i feel like my only friend
is the city i live in, the city of angels
lonely as i am, together we cry
i drive on her streets 'cause she's my companion
i walk through her hills 'cause she knows who i am
she sees my good deeds and she kisses me windy
well, i never worry, now that is a lie

i don't ever wanna feel like i did that day
but take me to the place i love, take me all the way
i don't ever wanna feel like i did that day
but take me to the place i love, take me all the way, yeah, yeah, yeah

it's hard to believe that there's nobody out there
it's hard to believe that i'm all alone
at least i have her love, the city, she loves me
lonely as i am, together we cry

i don't ever wanna feel like i did that day
but take me to the place i love, take me all the way
i don't ever wanna feel like i did that day

jessie is a friend
yeah, i know, he's been a good friend of mine
but lately something's changed that ain't hard to define
jessie's got himself a girl, and i wanna make her mine

and she's watching him with those eyes
and she's lovin' him with that body
i just know it
and he's holding her in his arms late, late at night

you know i wish that i had jessie's girl
i wish that i had jessie's girl
where can i find a woman like that?

i'll play along with this charade
that doesn't seem to be a reason to change
you know i feel so dirty when they start talking cute
i wanna tell her that i love her, but the point is probably moot

cause she's watching him with those eyes
and she's lovin' him with that body
i just know it
and he's holding her in his arms late, late at night

you know i wish that i had jessie's girl
i wish that i had jessie's girl
where can i find a woman like that?
like jessie's girl
i wish that i had jessie's girl
where can i find a woman...
where can i find a woman like that?

and i'm lookin' in the mirror all the time
wonderin' what she don't see in me
i've been funny; i've been cool with the lines
ain't that the way love's supposed to be?

tell me where can i find a woman like that?
you know i wish that i had jessie's girl
i wish that i had jessie's girl
i want jessie's girl
where can i find a woman like that?
like jessie's girl
i wish that i had jessie's girl
i want, i want jessie's girl

oh, what you want? what you need? what'd you come here for?
well, an eye for an eye and an 'f' for fight
they're taking me down as the prisoners riot
eh, yeah

i've got shackles on, my words are tied
fear can make you compromise
with the lights turned up, it's hard to hide
sometimes i want to disappear
eh, oh, eh

when i feel kinda bad and i don't want to stress
i just pass it off on ability
well you got what you want and what you never knew
perfect gift from me to you
yeah, eh, eh

i've got shackles on, my words are tied
fear can make you compromise
with the lights turned up, it's hard to hide
sometimes i want to disappear

 raise up to your ability 
you never knew what i could find
what could come when we realize
i don't want to compromise
 raise up to your ability 
yeah i'm scared but i disappear
running around before it corners you
like he's someone who's lost his way
 raise up to your ability 
i know that you want me
'cause it s simple to see of my ability
 raise up to your ability 
yeah, you're undecided
yeah, it's the right feeling
yeah, i don't wanna runaway

you gotta focus on your ability
focus on your ability
gotta focus on your ability
focus on your ability
then they can't get what they want to steal

i need the violence on the radio
i need a murderous sound just to let me know

everything a little lie, lie, lie

i hear the hollow trace of a tragic line
it got the kids in tow just to feed their mind
but sniffing only can pull apart
it takes a dead end soul to kill a dead end heart

it's another song
then it's gone
it's just another song
and then it's gone

i'll be your innocent lie, lie, lie

everything a little lie, lie, lie

i'm looking at you through the glass
don't know how much time has passed
oh, god, it feels like forever, but no one ever tells you
that forever feels like home, sitting all alone inside your head

how do you feel? that is the question
but i forget you don't expect an easy answer
when something like a soul becomes initialized and folded up
like paper dolls and little notes, you can t expect a bit of hope

so while you re outside looking in, describing what you see
remember what you re staring at is me

 cause i m looking at you through the glass
don t know how much time has passed
all i know is that it feels like forever, but no one ever tells you
that forever feels like home, sitting all alone inside your head

how much is real? so much to question
an epidemic of the mannequins, contaminating everything
we thought came from the heart, but never did right from the start
just listen to the noises, null and void instead of voices

before you tell yourself, it's just a different scene
remember it's just different from what you've seen

i'm looking at you through the glass
don't know how much time has passed
and all i know is that it feels like forever, but no one ever tells you
that forever feels like home, sitting all alone inside your head
'cause i'm looking at you through the glass
don't know how much time has passed
and all i know is that it feels like forever, but no one ever tells you
that forever feels like home, sitting all alone inside your head

and it's the stars, the stars
that shine for you
and it's the stars, the stars
that lie to you, yeah ah

i'm looking at you through the glass
don't know how much time has passed
oh, god, it feels like forever, but no one ever tells you
that forever feels like home, sitting all alone inside your head
'cause i'm looking at you through the glass
don't know how much time has passed
all i know is that it feels like forever, but no one ever tells you
that forever feels like home, sitting all alone inside your head

and it's the stars, the stars
that shine for you, yeah ah

that lie to you, yeah ah

that shine for you, yeah ah
and it's the stars, the stars
that lie to you, yeah yeah

oh and the stars
oh and the stars, they lie


i must admit, i can't explain
any of these thoughts racin' through my brain, it's true
baby i'm howlin' for you

there's something wrong, with this plot
the actors here have not got a clue
baby i'm howlin' for you

i'm worried all day, all day

were you ever lost?
were you ever young?
were you ever safe, little brother?
do you see the sense of the evidence?
are you still part of the struggle?
did you bang your head?
did you go to bed?
does it still pretty funky?
lay back and dream
in the death machine
pity you still think like a monkey
bring it up, bring it down
till you hit the ground
get a rude attitude
turn the world around
shall we see?
shall we disagree?
sing it all in the name of tragedy
do you ever lie?
ever wonder why
nobody believed you, honey?
what a pretty smile
drive the people wild
wonder who ran off with the money
do you ever change?
is it gonna rain?
will it bring you pennies from heaven?
do you know the score?
are you waiting for?
anxious for the new armageddon
live it up, live it down
till we hit the ground
cop a rude attitude
from the world around
shall we see?
shall we disagree?
sing it all in the name of tragedy
marbles in your mouth
what's it all about?
do you know the name of the winner?
if i was to go, would you let it show?
life is not a tv dinner
if you dream of me, will you ever see?
do you want a piece of the auction?
if i wasn't sure, would you do it more?
help me to achieve an erection
get it up, get it down
till you hit the ground
cop a rude attitude
turn the world around
shall we see?
shall we disagree?
all in the name of tragedy
sing it loud, sing it out
make the people shout
get it all, get it on, get it sorted out
be a seer, be sincere
can you really see?
all in the name of tragedy

this is our call to arms
will you stand beside me?
this is our time to fight
no more compromising
and this blackened heart will sing
for sad solidarity
halo over my demise
following a god so blind
sallow in their sickening
swallow not the shit they feed, yeah
this is our right to life
not religious right back
this is abortion's knife
aiming at the womb of
the christian conspiracy
so open my eyes and see
the halo over my demise
following a god so blind
sallow in their sickening
swallow not the shit they feed
let's aim for
our time will come
our time will come
our time is now
our time is now
and i won't pray for you
and i won't pray for you
and i won't pray for you
halo, follow, sallow, swallow
halo over our demise
following a god so blind
sallow in their sickening
swallow not the shit they feed

i hope they shit on you
satisfaction denied to run, turn and cry
cry, turn and cry, no cry, no cry, oh


i've been down this road once or twice before
through the open door
i come falling through it
there's a sign post up ahead
like a watershed
and it opens my eyes
ways, for me to begin
to be born again
and knowing for the first time
ways, all so differently
shine for me to see
the better man that i am

i've been places in my head
behind me worse than what's ahead
and on my path just like a dream
takes me from the inbetween
from out of nowhere you came strong as stone
and now i'll never have to be alone
what it is i know

you have always been my safe home
i walk, i run, i burn out into you
you have always been my safe home
my whole world has moved on

i know what i am and i'll always be
your reality, is better than i could dream
all my fears turn from black to white
and i'd stand and fight
the whole world for you
faith, and destiny
i never did believe
my only god is love and
faith, what i see in you
and i can hold it true
like a weight in my hand

since we're feeling so anaesthetised
in our comfort zone
reminds me of the second time
that i followed you home
we're running out of alibis
from the second of may
reminds me of the summer time
on this winter's day
see you at the bitter end
see you at the bitter end
every step we take that's synchronized
every broken bone
reminds me of the second time
that i followed you home
you shower me with lullabies
as you're walking away
reminds me that it's killing time
on this fateful day
see you at the bitter end
see you at the bitter end
see you at the bitter end
see you at the bitter end
from the time we intercepted
feels a lot like suicide
slow and sad, grown inside us
arouse and see you're mine
 see you at the bitter end 
love has seen your run around
who wanna seek you now?
i want a peace
i'd whine out
 see you at the bitter end 
love's reached his side
grab this gentleness inside
heard a cry
six feet down
in six weeks' time
the mess you left
will end
see you at the bitter end


jane says
i'm done with sergio
he treats me like a ragdoll
she hides the television
says i don't owe him nothing
but if he comes back again
tell him to wait right here for me
or just try again tomorrow
i'm gonna kick tomorrow
gonna kick tomorrow

jane says
have you seen my wig around
i feel naked without it
she knows they all want her to go
but that's okay, man
she don't like them anyway
jane says she's goin' away to spain
when she gets my money saved
i'm gonna start tomorrow
i'm gonna kick tomorrow
gonna kick tomorrow

she gets mad
starts to cry
she takes a swing but
she can't hit
she
don't mean no harm
she just don't know
what else to do about it

jane goes to the store at 8:00
she walk up on st. andrews
she waits and gets her dinner there
she pulls her dinner from her pocket
jane says
i've never been in love
i don't know what it is
she only knows if someone wants her
i want them if they want me
i only know they want me

she gets mad
starts to cry
she takes a swing but
she can't hit
she
don't mean no harm
she just don't know
what else to do about it

my veins are blue and connected
and every single bone in my brain is electric
but i dig ditches like the best of 'em
yo trabajo duro
como en madera y yeso
como en madera y yeso
and even god herself has fewer plans than me
but she never helps me out with my scams for free, though
she grabs a stick and then she pokes it at me
when i say nothin', i say everything
yeah when i say nothin', i say everything
they threw me down in a lazaretto
born rotten, bored rotten
makin' models of people i used to know
out of coffee and cotton
and all my illegitimate kids have begotten
thrown down to the wolves, made feral for nuttin'
quarantined on the isle of man
and i'm tryin' to escape any way that i can, oh
any way that i can, oh
i have no time left
time is lost
no time at all, throw it in a garbage can
and i shake god's hand
i jump up and let her know when i can
this is how i'm gonna do it
 guitar solo 
they wanna blow down the prison
they're lightin' fires with the cash of the masses
and like the dough, i don't fall down
i'm so detroit i make it rise from the ashes


he came from somewhere back in her long ago
the sentimental fool don't see
tryin' hard to recreate
what had yet to be created once in her life
she musters a smile for his nostalgic tale
never coming near what he wanted to say
only to realize it never really was

she had a place in his life
he never made her think twice
as he rises to her apology
anybody else would surely know
he's watching her go

but what a fool believes, he sees
no wise man has the power to reason away
what seems to be
is always better than nothing
than nothing at all

keeps sending him somewhere back in her long ago
where he can still believe there's a place in her life
someday, somewhere
she will return

she had a place in his life
he never made her think twice
as he rises to her apology
anybody else would surely know
he's watching her go

but what a fool believes, he sees
no wise man has the power to reason away
what seems to be
is always better than nothing
than nothing at all
but what a fool believes, he sees
no wise man has the power to reason away
what seems to be
is always better than nothing
than nothing at all


well the cops are taking over
while everyone's in yoga
'cause happiness is still a warm gun
what's it to be free man?
what's a european?
me i just believe in the sun

take me down
through the streets of chinatown
show me that you know some places
god told me
live a life of luxury
all our lives we've both been waiting

telephonic doses
eliminate neurosis
and some say it's the cause of it all
concentrate on winning
forget about beginning
forget about the middle and end

take me down
through the streets of chinatown
show me that you know some places
god told me
live a life of luxury
all our lives we've both been waiting

take me down
through the streets of chinatown

when you were here before
couldn't look you in the eye
you're just like an angel
your skin makes me cry
you float like a feather
in a beautiful world
i wish i was special
you're so fuckin' special

but i'm a creep
i'm a weirdo
what the hell am i doing here?
i don't belong here

i don't care if it hurts
i wanna have control
i want a perfect body
i want a perfect soul
i want you to notice
when i'm not around
you're so fuckin' special
i wish i was special

but i'm a creep
i'm a weirdo

i wish i was special
but i'm a creep

can't get the stink off
he's been hanging 'round for days
comes like a comet
suckered you but not your friends
one day he'll get to you
and teach you how to be a holy cow

you do it to yourself, you do
and that's what really hurts
is that you do it to yourself, just you
you and no one else
you do it to yourself
you do it to yourself

don't get my sympathy
hanging out the fifteenth floor
you've changed the locks three times
he still comes reeling through the door
one day i'll get to you
and teach you how to get to purest hell

you do it to yourself, you do
and that's what really hurts
is that you do it to yourself, just you
you and no one else
you do it to yourself
you do it to yourself

you do it to yourself, you do
and that's what really hurts
is that you do it to yourself, just you
you and no one else
you do it to yourself
you do it to yourself
self


in the shuffling madness
of the locomotive breath
runs the all time loser
headlong to his death
he feels the piston scraping
steam breaking on his brow
old charlie stole the handle
and the train it won't stop going
no way to slow down
oh, oh 
he sees his children jumping off
at the stations   one by one
his woman and his best friend
in bed and having fun
he's crawling down the corridor
on his hands and knees
old charlie stole the handle and
the train it won't stop going
no way to slow down
hey, hey 

he hears the silence howling
catches angels as they fall
and the all time winner
has got him by the balls
oh, he picks up gideon's bible
open at page one
i said, god, he stole the handle and
the train it won't stop goin'
no way to slow down
no way to slow down
no way to slow down
no way to slow down
no way to slow down
no way to slow down

i guess the time was right for us to say
we'd take our time and live our lives
together day by day
we'll make a wish and send it on a prayer
we know our dreams can all come true
with love that we can share
with you i never wonder   will you be there for me?
with you i never wonder   you're the right one for me?

i finally found the love of a lifetime
a love to last my whole life through
i finally found the love of a lifetime
forever in my heart
i finally found the love of a lifetime
with every kiss, our love is like brand new
and every star up in the sky
was made for me and you
still we both know that the road is long
we know that we will be together
because our love is strong




as we walk the golden mile
down the pretty aisle
i know that you are mine
and there's nothin' in this world
that i know i wouldn't do
to be near you every day
every hour, every minute
take my hand
and let me lead the way
all through your life
i'll be by your side
till death do us part
baby, i'll be your friend
my love will never end
till death do us part
when i wake up every day
with you lyin' in my arms
i wonder if i'm dreamin'
when i look into your eyes
i just can't believe it's true
that my heart belongs to you
baby, we can have it all
girl, take my hand
and let me lead the way
all through your life
i'll be by your side
till death do us part

till death do us part
there'll be good times
and there'll be bad
but i will stand beside you
woman, all the way
and through the years
as life will put us through
when snow will fall on winter nights
i'll keep you warm inside

a pounding in my brain
it's driving me crazy

we don't need to talk about it anymore

so this is love, or so you tell me
as you're walkin', out the door
months go by, and i know for certain
it's not the love, i'm lookin' for
some times, just for a moment
i reach out; hope you're still there
miles away
no; you're never turnin' back
i just can't wait anymore
miles away
nothin' left of what we had
just when i needed you most...
you were miles away...
it's hard to tell, what you're goin' through
you kept your feelings locked inside of you
open your heart, and chances are
what you're feelin', i'm feelin' too
if only, just for a moment
hold on, to the dreams that we had
miles away
no; you're never turnin' back
i just can't wait anymore
miles away
nothin' left of what we had
just when i needed you most
you were miles away
when times were tough, and you were down and out
who was there by your side?
now you've gone; i'm so tired of bein' alone..
with only your promises...
lonliness just fades away
thoughts of you; just memories
no cryin' now, for what we're missin'
time won't forget what you meant to me
hold me, just for a moment
hold on, to the dreams that we had
miles away
no; you're never turnin' back
i just can't wait anymore
miles away
nothin' left of what we had
just when i needed you most, whoa oh
miles away
no; you're never turnin' back
i just can't wait anymore
miles away
nothin' left of what we had
just when i needed you most...
you were mi les a way...


would you know my name
if i saw you in heaven?
would it be the same
if i saw you in heaven?
i must be strong and carry on
 cause i know i don't belong here in heaven

would you hold my hand
if i saw you in heaven?
would you help me stand
if i saw you in heaven?
i'll find my way through night and day
 cause i know i just can't stay here in heaven

time can bring you down, time can bend your knees
time can break your heart, have you begging please, begging please
beyond the door there's peace i'm sure
and i know there'll be no more tears in heaven

would you know my name
if i saw you in heaven?
would you feel the same
if i saw you in heaven?
i must be strong and carry on
because i know i don't belong here in heaven

and i was freaking
i was ready to go 
and i swear
besides the hair
she had one white eye
one blank stare
looking up
lying there
on the stand
near her hand

and there was nobody else

went home and learned how
to clean up after myself

i took you out at the start of the week
we went for dinner with people like us
i wanted you to think i could be chic
but we went home on the back of the bus
i said then maybe you're not on my page
but don t you worry you've got to an age
where you can't do this shit anymore
and then i promised you i d never felt like this before

of tryin' to kiss you

if you wanted to

as your lips unfold
shaken purple from the cold

you better learn to crawl

you broke my mouth
the bloody bits are spitting out
is your grave unscathed
the worm is counting down the days

the crucified usa
as their hypocrisy unfolds
oh hell is truly on its way

as we await the wrath
they never went to sunday mass

they want to see us crawl
they want to see us crawl
before they walk away
before they walk away

the reds and the whites and abused
the crucified usa
as their hypocrisy unfolds
oh hell is truly on its way

i've exposed your lies, baby
the underneath's no big surprise
now it's time for changing
and cleansing everything
to forget your love

my plug in baby
crucifies my enemies
when i'm tired of giving, whoa
my plug in baby
in unbroken virgin realities
is tired of living

don't confuse
baby you're gonna lose
your own game
change me
and replace the envying
to forget your love

my plug in baby
crucifies my enemies
when i'm tired of giving, whoa
my plug in baby
in unbroken virgin realities
is tired of living

and i've seen your loving
mine is gone
and i've been in trouble
wooaahhhh

saturday night i was downtown
working for the fbi
sitting in a nest of bad men
whiskey bottles piling high
bootlegging boozer on the west side
full of people who are doing wrong
just about to call up the da man
when i heard this woman singing a song
a pair of 45's made me open my eyes
my temperature started to rise
she was a long cool woman in a black dress
just a 5'9" beautiful tall
with just one look i was a bad mess
'cause that long cool woman had it all
woo 
i saw her head up to the table
with a tall walking big black cat
well, charlie said "i hope that you're able, boy
'cause i'm telling you she knows where it's at"
when suddenly we heard the sirens
and everybody started to run
i jumped down and across the table
when i heard somebody shooting a gun
well, the da was pumping my left hand
and then she was a holding my right
well, i told her "don't get scared
'cause you're gonna be spared"
well i've gotta be forgiven
if i wanna spend my living
with a long cool woman in a black dress
just a 5'9" beautiful tall
well, with just one look i was a bad mess
'cause that long cool woman had it all
had it all, had it all
had it all, had it all
had it all, had it all


culture sucks down words
itemise loathing and feed yourself smiles
organise your safe tribal war
hurt maim kill and enslave the ghetto
each day living out a lie
life sold cheaply forever, ever, ever

under neon loneliness motorcycle emptiness
under neon loneliness motorcycle emptiness

life lies a slow suicide
orthodox dreams and symbolic myths
from feudal serf to spender
this wonderful world of purchase power
just like lungs sucking on air
survivals natural as sorrow, sorrow, sorrow

under neon loneliness motorcycle emptiness
under neon loneliness motorcycle emptiness

all we want from you are the kicks you ve given us
all we want from you are the kicks you ve given us
all we want from you are the kicks you ve given us
all we want from you are the kicks you ve given us

under neon loneliness motorcycle emptiness
under neon loneliness motorcycle emptiness

drive away and it's the same
everywhere death row, everyone's a victim
your joys are counterfeit
this happiness corrupt political shit
living life like a comatose
ego loaded and swallow, swallow, swallow

under neon loneliness motorcycle emptiness
under neon loneliness everlasting nothingness

freedom on like stems from walk away
you gotta hold your time
you gotta hit him with the right of way
maybe black too far for any like the one seen
in a way it's sane, either way it's gotta mean
red sister might be chokin'
but i ain't about that kind
answer me with the rhythm of a body
that was born to lose two times
hey big bo day
he says deny, but you're for tin lie
head my shoulder
big boat deloves, big boat denies
they might try to hide
they have to have some more dead sense
you might be rye like a ball in the wind
poison dandy lifeforms crime
mix both down cross sticky pedal the line
the flavor might be missin'
but he acts to cross that anyway
you can bet he can diddle with the promise
in the power of another day
hey big bo day
he says deny, but you're for tin lie
head my shoulder
big boat deloves, big boat denies
two of you sold my wallet
one of you stole my tie
didn't you say that you're watching?
denied
venomous stole in me
three of you standing by
didn't you say that you've got it?
watch me eye


one time a thing occurred to me
what's real and what's for sale?
blew a kiss and tried to take it home

it isn't you, isn't me
search for things that you can't see
going blind, out of reach
somewhere in the vasoline

two times and it has rendered me
punch drunk and without bail
think i'd be safer all alone

flies in the vasoline we are
sometimes it blows my mind
keep getting stuck here all the time

it isn't you, isn't me
search for things that you can't see
going blind, out of reach
somewhere in the vasoline

you'll see the look and you'll see the lies
you'll eat the lies and you will

the ashtray says
you were up all night
when you went to bed
with your darkest mind
your pillow wept
and covered your eyes
and you finally slept
while the sun caught fire
you've changed

we fell in love
in the key of c
we walked along
down by the sea
you followed me down
the neck to d
and fell again
into the sea
you changed
oh, you've changed

maybe all i need is a shot in the arm
something in my veins bloodier than blood

the ashtray says
you were up all night
when you went to bed
with your darkest mind
you changed
oh, you've changed

what you once were isn't what you want to be any more


you spurn my natural emotions
you make me feel i'm dirt and i'm hurt
and if i start a commotion
i run the risk of losing you and that's worse

ever fallen in love with someone
ever fallen in love, in love with someone
ever fallen in love, in love with someone
you shouldn't've fallen in love with?

i can't see much of the future
unless we find out what's to blame, what a shame
and we won't be together much longer
unless we realize that we are the same

ever fallen in love with someone
ever fallen in love, in love with someone
ever fallen in love, in love with someone
you shouldn't've fallen in love with?

you spurn my natural emotions
you make me feel i'm dirt and i'm hurt
and if i start a commotion

i'm gonna fight 'em off
a seven nation army couldn't hold me back
they're gonna rip it off
taking their time right behind my back
and i'm talking to myself at night
because i can't forget
back and forth through my mind
behind a cigarette

and the message coming from my eyes
says "leave it alone"


don't want to hear about it
every single one's got a story to tell
everyone knows about it
from the queen of england to the hounds of hell
and if i catch it coming back my way
i'm gonna serve it to you
and that ain't what you want to hear
but that's what i'll do

and the feeling coming from my bones
says "find a home"



i'm going to wichita
far from this opera forevermore
i'm gonna work the straw
make the sweat drip out of every pore
and i'm bleeding, and i'm bleeding, and i'm bleeding
right before the lord
all the words are gonna bleed from me
and i will think no more

and the stains coming from my blood
tell me "go back home"



i've got another confession to make, i'm your fool
everyone's got their chains to break, holdin' you
were you born to resist or be abused?

is someone getting the best
the best, the best, the best of you?
is someone getting the best
the best, the best, the best of you?

are you gone and on to someone new?
i needed somewhere to hang my head without your noose
you gave me something that i didn't have, but had no use
i was too weak to give in, too strong to lose
my heart is under arrest again, but i break loose
my head is giving me life or death, but i can't choose
i swear i'll never give in, i refuse

is someone getting the best
the best, the best, the best of you?
is someone getting the best
the best, the best, the best of you?
has someone taken your faith?
it's real, the pain you feel
you trust, you must confess
is someone getting the best
the best, the best, the best of you?
oh, oh oh, oh oh

has someone taken your faith?
it's real, the pain you feel
the life, the love you'd die to heal
the hope that starts the broken hearts
you trust, you must confess

is someone getting the best
the best, the best, the best of you?
is someone getting the best
the best, the best, the best of you?

i've got another confession, my friend, i'm no fool
i'm getting tired of starting again somewhere new
were you born to resist or be abused?
i swear i'll never give in, i refuse

is someone getting the best
the best, the best, the best of you?
is someone getting the best
the best, the best, the best of you?
has someone taken your faith?
it's real, the pain you feel
you trust, you must confess
is someone getting the best
the best, the best, the best of you?


hey little monster, i got my eye on you
where are you going, where you running to?
hey little monster, you know it's all ok
i'm gonna love ya, no matter what you say

i've got love on my fingers
lust on my tongue

another turning point, a fork stuck in the road
time grabs you by the wrist, directs you where to go
so make the best of this test, and don't ask why
it's not a question, but a lesson learned in time

it's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right
i hope you had the time of your life

so take the photographs, and still frames in your mind
hang it on a shelf in good health and good time
tattoos of memories and dead skin on trial
for what it's worth, it was worth all the while

it's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right
i hope you had the time of your life

it's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right
i hope you had the time of your life
it's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right
i hope you had the time of your life

and baby, i feel so down
and i don't know why i keep walking for miles

and say, people, they don't understand
your girlfriends, they can't understand
your grandsons, they won't understand
on top of this, i ain't ever gonna understand

last night, she said, "oh, baby, don't feel so down
oh, it turns me off when i feel left out"
so i, i turned round, oh, baby, gonna be alright
it was a great big lie, 'cause i left that night, yeah

oh, people, they don't understand
no, girlfriends, they don't understand
in spaceships, they won't understand
and me, i ain't ever gonna understand

last night, she said, "oh, baby, i feel so down

so i, i turned 'round, oh, little girl, i don't care no more
i know this for sure, i'm walking out that door, yeah

 hey 
 hey 
 hey 
when you look, you see right through me
cut the rope, fell to my knees
born and broken every single time
always keep me under finger
that's the spot where you run to me
might see some type of pleasure in my mind
yeah, here comes the water
it comes to wash away the sins of you and i
this time, you see
 hey 
 hey 
 hey 
when you seek me, you destroy me
rape my mind and smell the poppies
born and bloodied every single time
always keep me under finger
that's the spot where you might linger
but i see some type of pleasure in my mind
yeah, here comes the water
it comes to wash away the sins of you and i
this time, you see
like holy water
it only burns you faster than you'll ever dry
this time, with me
when you look you see right through me
cut the rope, fell to my knees
born and bloodied
every single time
yeah, here comes the water
it comes to wash away the sins of you and i
this time, you see
like holy water
it only burns you faster than you'll ever dry
this time, with me
 hey 
 hey 
 hey 


a heart that's full up like a landfill
a job that slowly kills you
bruises that won't heal
you look so tired, unhappy
bring down the government
they don't, they don't speak for us
i'll take a quiet life
a handshake of carbon monoxide

and no alarms and no surprises
no alarms and no surprises
no alarms and no surprises
silent, silent

this is my final fit
my final bellyache with

no alarms and no surprises
no alarms and no surprises
no alarms and no surprises, please

such a pretty house
and such a pretty garden

no alarms and no surprises
 let me out of here 
no alarms and no surprises

i won't run away no more
i promise
even when i get bored
i promise
even when you lock me out
i promise
i say my prayers every night
i promise

i know which side i'm spread
i promise
the tantrums and the chitty chats
i promise

even when the ship is wrecked
i promise

i promise

i won't run away no more
i promise
even when i get bored
i promise

even when the ship is wrecked

hey it's me
i i just got off the train
a frightening place
the faces are concrete grey
and i'm wondering, should i turn around?
buy another ticket?
the panic is coming on strong
so cold, from the inside out
no great drama
message coming in
in the oh so smug
glassy eyed light of day
glassy eyed light of day

where the path trails off
and heads down the mountain
through the dry bush
i don't know where it leads
and i don't really care
where the path trails off
and heads down the mountain
through the dry bush
i don't know where it leads
and i don't really care

i feel this love to the core
i feel this love turn cold


they love me like i was a brother
they protect me, listen to me
they dug me my very own garden
gave me sunshine, made me happy

nice dream
nice dream
nice dream

i call up my friend, the good angel
but she's out with her answerphone
she said that she'd love to come help, but
the sea would electrocute us all

nice dream
nice dream
nice dream
nice dream
nice dream
nice dream
nice dream
 if you think that you're strong enough 
nice dream
 if you think you belong enough 
nice dream
 if you think that you're strong enough 
nice dream
 if you think you belong enough 


nice dream
nice dream
nice dream
nice dream


i thought i saw a man brought to life
he was warm, he came around like he was dignified
he showed me what it was to cry
well, you couldn't be that man i adored
you don't seem to know, or seem to care what your heart is for
but i don't know him anymore

there's nothing where he used to lie
my conversation has run dry
that's what's going on

nothing's fine, i'm torn
i'm all out of faith
this is how i feel
i'm cold and i am shamed
lying naked on the floor
illusion never changed
into something real
i'm wide awake and i can see
the perfect sky is torn
you're a little late, i'm already torn

so i guess the fortune teller's right
should have seen just what was there
and not some holy light
but you crawled beneath my veins

and now i don't care, i had no luck
i don't miss it all that much
there's just so many things

that i can touch, i'm torn
i'm all out of faith
this is how i feel
i'm cold and i am shamed
lying naked on the floor
illusion never changed
into something real
i'm wide awake and i can see
the perfect sky is torn
you're a little late, i'm already torn
torn

there's nothing where he used to lie
my inspiration has run dry
that's what's going on

nothing's right, i'm torn
i'm all out of faith
this is how i feel
i'm cold and i am shamed
lying naked on the floor
illusion never changed
into something real
i'm wide awake and i can see
the perfect sky is torn

i'm all out of faith
this is how i feel
i'm cold and i'm ashamed
bound and broken on the floor
you're a little late, i'm already torn
torn
oh
 oh yeah, a little 
 oh yeah, a little 
 oh yeah, a little 


can't get the stink off
he's been hanging 'round for days
comes like a comet
suckered you but not your friends
one day he'll get to you
and teach you how to be a holy cow

you do it to yourself, you do
and that's what really hurts
is that you do it to yourself, just you
you and no one else
you do it to yourself
you do it to yourself

don't get my sympathy
hanging out the fifteenth floor
you've changed the locks three times
he still comes reeling through the door
one day i'll get to you
and teach you how to get to purest hell

you do it to yourself, you do
and that's what really hurts
is that you do it to yourself, just you
you and no one else
you do it to yourself
you do it to yourself

you do it to yourself, you do
and that's what really hurts
is that you do it to yourself, just you
you and no one else
you do it to yourself
you do it to yourself
self


and the wise man said i don't want to hear your voice
and the thin man said i don't want to hear your voice
and they're cursing me, and they won't let me be
and there's nothing to say, and there's nothing to do

stop whispering, start shouting
stop whispering, start shouting

and the mother say we spit on your son some more
and the buildings say we spit on your face some more
and the feeling is that there's something wrong
because i can't find the words and i can't find the songs

stop whispering, start shouting
stop whispering, start shouting

dear sir, i have a complaint
dear sir, i have a complaint
can't remember what it is
it doesn't matter anyway
it doesn't matter anyway

stop whispering, stop whispering
stop whispering, start shouting


destiny, destiny protect me from the world
destiny, hold my hand protect me from the world

here we are with our running and confusion
and i don't see no confusion anywhere

and if the world does turn
and if london burns
i'll be standing on the beach with my guitar
i wanna be in a band when i get to heaven
anyone can play guitar
and they won't be a nothing anymore

grow my hair
grow my hair, i am jim morrison
grow my hair
i wanna be wanna be wanna be jim morrison

here we are with our running and confusion
and i don't see no confusion anywhere

and if the world does turn
and if london burns i'll be standing on the beach with my guitar
i wanna be in a band when i get to heaven
anyone can play guitar
and they won't be a nothing anymore


i can't afford to breathe in this time
nowhere to sit without a gun in my hand
hooked back up to the cathode ray

i'm better off dead, i'm better off dead
i'm better off

prove yourself
prove yourself
prove yourself

i wanna breathe, i wanna grow
i'd say i want it but i don't know how
i work, i bleed, i beg and pray

but i'm better off dead, i'm better off dead
i'm better off

prove yourself
prove yourself

hello, i've waited here for you
everlong
tonight, i throw myself into
and out of the red
out of her head, she sang
come down, and waste away with me
down with me
slow how you wanted it to be
and over my head, out of her head she sang

and i wonder when i sing along with you

if everything could ever feel this real forever
if anything could ever be this good again
the only thing i'll ever ask of you
you've got to promise not to stop when i say when
she sang

breathe out, so i can breathe you in
hold you in
and now i know you've always been
and out of your head, out of my head i sang

and i wonder when i sing along with you

if everything could ever feel this real forever
if anything could ever be this good again
the only thing i'll ever ask of you
you've got to promise not to stop when i say when
she sang


and i wonder...

if everything could ever feel this real forever
if anything could ever be this good again
the only thing i'll ever ask of you
you've got to promise not to stop when i say when

the water is wide, i cannot get o'er
neither have i wings to fly
give me a boat that can carry two
and both shall row, my love and i
where love is planted o there it grows
it grows and blossoms like a rose
it has a sweet and pleasant smell
no flower on earth can it excel
a ship there is and she sails the sea
she's loaded deep as deep can be
but not so deep as the love i'm in
i know not if i sink or swim
oh love is gentle and love is kind
the sweetest flower when first it is new
but love grows old and waxes cold
and fades away like the morning dew


i follow the moskva
down to gorky park
listening to the wind of change
an august summer night
soldiers passing by
listening to the wind of change

the world is closing in
and did you ever think
that we could be so close, like brothers?
the future's in the air
i can feel it everywhere
blowing with the wind of change

take me to the magic of the moment
on a glory night
where the children of tomorrow dream away
in the wind of change

walking down the street
and distant memories
are buried in the past forever
i follow the moskva
and down to gorky park
listening to the wind of change

take me to the magic of the moment
on a glory night
where the children of tomorrow share their dreams
with you and me
take me to the magic of the moment
on a glory night
where the children of tomorrow dream away
in the wind of change

the wind of change blows straight
into the face of time
like a storm wind that will ring
the freedom bell for peace of mind
let your balalaika sing
what my guitar wants to sing

take me to the magic of the moment
on a glory night
where the children of tomorrow share their dreams
with you and me
take me to the magic of the moment
on a glory night
where the children of tomorrow dream away
in the wind of change


she said i don't wanna go out chasing
i kinda wanna go out dancing
forget about the guys
'cause it doesn't feel right
so he left, drinking with the boys in convoy
flirting with the girls who play coy
i doubt he even knows
that it doesn't feel right

it started off with her hair
guess every night has gotta start somewhere
another badly combed frown
'cause mirrors always seem to bring her down
going through the motions of
strangeways, here we come and teenage love
you see there's something inside
a voice that's telling her to stay behind
so as friends approached her
she looked over her shoulder and

she said, i don't wanna go out chasing
i kinda wanna go out dancing
forget about the guys
'cause it doesn't feel right
so he left, drinking with the boys in convoy
flirting with the girls who play coy
i doubt he even knows
that it doesn't feel right

acting like he doesn't care
oh, but he's really the most self aware
he'd cut his heart out to be cool
'cause everybody loves a criminal
knocking back a drink or two
she's on his mind and this he thinks is true
but ain't it funny that we're never
certain of the way we are?
another youth wasted and eternally tainted

she said, i don't wanna go out chasing
i kinda wanna go out dancing
forget about the guys
'cause it doesn't feel right

'cept the look

but the fact is that i may
that's what all the friends i do not like as much as you say
"well, give it just another couple months or so
then you'll be okay."
that's what all the friends i do not like as much as you say

alone, all alone
i am on my own

well, i heard there was a secret chord
that david played and it pleased the lord
but you don't really care for music, do you?
well it goes like this: the fourth, the fifth
the minor fall and the major lift
the baffled king composing hallelujah

hallelujah
hallelujah
hallelujah
hallelujah

your faith was strong but you needed proof
you saw her bathing on the roof
her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you
she tied you to her kitchen chair
she broke your throne and she cut your hair
and from your lips she drew the hallelujah

hallelujah
hallelujah
hallelujah
hallelujah

baby, i've been here before
i've seen this room and i've walked this floor  you know 
i used to live alone before i knew you
and i've seen your flag on the marble arch
and love is not a victory march
it's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah

hallelujah
hallelujah
hallelujah
hallelujah

there was a time when you let me know
what's really going on below
but now you never show that to me, do you?
but remember when i moved in you
and the holy dove was moving too
and every breath we drew was hallelujah

hallelujah
hallelujah
hallelujah
hallelujah

maybe there's a god above
but all i've ever learned from love
was how to shoot somebody who outdrew you
and it's not a cry that you hear at night
it's not somebody who's seen the light
it's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah

hallelujah
hallelujah
hallelujah
hallelujah
hallelujah
hallelujah
hallelujah
hallelujah
hallelujah
hallelujah
hallelujah
hallelujah
hallelujah


one o'clock in the morning
and i'm leaving from the club
my friends are having a party
kind of feel i've had enough

at two o'clock in the morning
sure i'm at the party house
i meet the roommate getting some water
she got a baby in her stomach
oh oh oh oh oah oh
oh oh oh oh oah oh
oh oh oh oh oah oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh

three o'clock in the morning
we hear a scream above the sounds
looks like the baby in her belly
thinks it's time to come on out

four o'clock in the morning
i'm driving all over the road
i swerve a dog on the high street
and crash into the post
oh oh oh oh oah oh
oh oh oh oh oah oh
oh oh oh oh oah oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh

she can't wait any longer
i got to help her come into the world
the police try to arrest us
but then they see the baby girl

five o'clock in the morning
i'm drinking coffee on the ward
i take a walk in to see her
tells me 'bout the dad that took off
oh oh oh oh oah oh
oh oh oh oh oah oh
oh oh oh oh oah oh
all in one night
all in one night

six o'clock in the morning
and now we're 22 months along
she asked me to be the daddy
and get married when it snows
oh oh oh oh oah oh
oh oh oh oh oah oh
oh oh oh oh oah oh
all in one night
all in one night
all in one night
all in one night, one night
all in one night
oh oh oh oh oah oh
oh oh oh oh oah oh
oh oh oh oh oah oh

i didn't see it coming  coming 
but i never really had much faith
in the universe's magic  magic , oh, no
till it pulled us to that time and place
and i'll never forget
when the floodgates opened, we, we cried an ocean
it still has me choking; it's hard to explain
i know you know me, you don't have to show me
i, i feel you're lonely, no need to explain

so don't say you love me; fala, "amo"
just let your heart speak up, and i'll know
no amount of words could ever find a way to make sense of this
so i wanna hear your mother tongue
so don't say you love me; fala, "amo"
just let your heart speak up, and i'll know
no amount of words could ever find a way to make sense of this
so i wanna hear your mother tongue

and yeah, i could be punching
but i always tend to fluctuate
and i feel sick that i'm buzzing, oh, love, i'm in trouble
i'm sorry, but you got me gushing all over the place
i never wanna get wet
but i think we're chosen like our fates were woven
and all of those bad choices were left turns on the way

so don't say you love me; fala, "amo"
just let your heart speak up, and i'll know
no amount of words could ever find a way to make sense of this
so i wanna hear your mother tongue
so don't say you love me; fala, "amo"
just let your heart speak up, and i'll know
no amount of words could ever find a way to make sense of this
so i wanna hear your mother tongue

i think best way to explain, it's like  oh oh, oh oh 
yeah, kinda like that, but a little more  oh oh, oh oh oh 
yeah, all makes sense, right? like  oh oh, oh oh 
like  oh oh, oh oh 
like  oh oh, oh oh oh 

so don't say you love me; fala, "amo"
just let your heart speak up, and i'll know
no amount of words could ever find a way to make sense of this
so i wanna hear your mother tongue
so don't say you love me; fala, "amo"
just let your heart speak up, and i'll know
no amount of words could ever find a way to make sense of this
so i wanna hear your mother tongue
so don't say you love me; fala, "amo"
just let your heart speak up, and i'll know
no amount of words could ever find a way to make sense of this
so i wanna hear your mother tongue


traveling in a fried out kombi
on a hippie trail, head full of zombie
i met a strange lady, she made me nervous
she took me in and gave me breakfast
and she said

where women glow and men plunder
can't you hear, can't you hear the thunder?
you better run, you better take cover

buying bread from a man in brussels
he was six foot four and full of muscles
i said, "do you speak a my language?"
he just smiled and gave me a vegemite sandwich
and he said

i come from a land down under
where beer does flow and men chunder
can't you hear, can't you hear the thunder?
you better run, you better take cover, yeah

lyin' in a den in bombay
with a slack jaw, and not much to say
i said to the man, "are you trying to tempt me
because i come from the land of plenty?"
and he said

do you come from a land down under  oh yeah yeah 
where women glow and men plunder
can't you hear, can't you hear the thunder?
you better run, you better take cover
living in a land down under
where women glow and men plunder

right over our heads while i was sleeping
you said that the clouds were always weeping rain
jennifer, jenn, let's make it come true

just a small town girl
living in a lonely world
she took the midnight train
going anywhere

just a city boy
born and raised in south detroit
he took the midnight train
going anywhere

a singer in a smoky room
a smell of wine and cheap perfume
for a smile they can share the night
it goes on and on and on and on

strangers waiting
up and down the boulevard
their shadows searching in the night
streetlights, people
living just to find emotion
hiding somewhere in the night

working hard to get my fill
everybody wants a thrill
payin' anything to roll the dice
just one more time

some will win, some will lose
some were born to sing the blues
oh, the movie never ends
it goes on and on and on and on

strangers waiting
up and down the boulevard
their shadows searching in the night
streetlights, people
living just to find emotion
hiding somewhere in the night


don't stop believin'
hold on to that feeling
streetlights, people
ohohohhhhhhhhhh
don't stop believin'
hold on
streetlights, people
ohohohhhhhhhhhh
don't stop believin'
hold on to that feeling
streetlights, people
ohohohhhhhhhhhh

steam in the subway earth is afire

and catch my breathing even closer behind
do do do do do do do dodo dododo dodo

in touch with the ground
i'm on the hunt down i'm after you
smell like i sound i'm lost in a crowd
and i'm hungry like the wolf
straddle the line in discord and rhyme
i'm on the hunt down i'm after you
mouth is alive with juices like wine
and i'm hungry like the wolf

stalked in the forest too close to hide
i'll be upon you by the moonlight side
do do do do do do do dodo dododo dodo
high blood drumming on your skin it's so tight
you feel my heat i'm just a moment behind
do do do do do do do dodo dododo dodo

in touch with the ground
i'm on the hunt down i'm after you
scent and a sound. i'm lost and i'm found
and i'm hungry like the wolf
strut on a line it's discord and rhyme
i howl and i whine i'm after you
mouth is alive all running inside
and i'm hungry like the wolf

hungry like the wolf
hungry like the wolf
hungry like the wolf

burning the ground i break from the crowd
i'm on the hunt down i'm after you
i smell like i sound. i'm lost and i'm found

i am a dominant gene, live as i die
never say forever cause forever's a lie
i can see right through you so i can ignore you
the story changes but the ending won't bore you
i tried to tell you but you simply obeyed
they didn't listen so they threw you away
now all you do is talk, i don't want to hear your bullshit
is this what you want? 

this is where it begins
this is where it ends
this is where it begins
and this is where it ends

they called us a dead generation
they told us that we wouldn't survive
they left us alone in the maelstrom
as you can see we're all clearly alive
we know where you are and we're coming
let's see you say that shit to our face
30 30 150 remembers
30 30 150 hates 

in my own peculiar way i feel mercurial
before i get ahead of myself again
i know the where but i still don't know the when
you want to live in a one sided world
be prepared for a whole world of hurt
now it's the grand facade
i don't want to be an angel
i just want to be god

they called us a dead generation
they told us that we wouldn't survive
they left us alone in the maelstrom

i am a fucking machine fueled by the past
a memory's a memory until it's a fact
i can bury the hatchet and let some shit go
but i got too many grudges to hold
saw a lot of people die in the end
i never want to walk that road again
now i will never give up
i don't want to have it all
i just want to have enough

this is where it begins
this is where it ends
this is where it begins
and this is where it ends

they called us a dead generation
they told us that we wouldn't survive
they left us alone in the maelstrom

i've got a secret
it's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
and i'm gonna keep it
i know something you don't know

it sits in silence, eats away at me
it feeds like cancer, this guilt could fill a fucking sea
pulling teeth, wolves at my door
now falling and failing is all i know
this disease is getting worse
i counted my blessings, now i'll count this curse
the only thing i really know: i can't sleep at night
i'm buried and breathing in regret, yeah

i may look happy, but honestly, dear
the only way i'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear
i see the vultures, they watch me bleed
they lick their lips, as all my shame spills out of me

repent, repent, the end is nigh
repent, repent, we're all gonna die
repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
so get on your knees and pray for
repent, repent, the end is nigh
repent, repent, we're all gonna die
repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
so get on your knees and pray for forgiveness

we all carry these things inside that no one else can see
they hold us down like anchors, they drown us out at sea
i look up to the sky, there may be nothing there to see
but if i don't believe in him, why would he believe in me?
why would he believe in me?
why would he believe in me?
why would he believe in me?
why would he believe in me?

angel, put sad wings around me now
protect me from this world of sin
so that we can rise again
oh angel, we can find our way somehow
escaping from the world we're in
to a place where we began
and i know we'll find
a better place and peace of mind
just tell me that it's all you want, for you and me
angel won't you set me free
angel remember how we'd chase the sun
then reaching for the stars at night
as our lives had just begun
when i close my eyes
i hear your velvet wings and cry
i'm waiting here with open arms
oh, can't you see
angel shine your light on me
oh, angel we'll meet once more, i'll pray
when all my sins are washed away
hold me inside your wings and stay
oh, angel take me far away

i've gone so far, my hands are hard
but i wanna touch you
'cause i know you're lonely
i've seen despair, but i still care
my heart is together
my head is exploding

everyone out there says you've been goin' a bit too hard
everyone out there says you've been testin' man and god
tryin' to make the scene
why don't you come back to me
why don't you come back to me
why don't you come back to me

tied off myself, then got some help
i'm comin' and goin'
i can't get enough, man
get high, get saved
look out, be brave
the waves are still rolling, you're hooked on a feeling

everyone out there says you've been goin' a bit too hard

do you wanna start a cult with me?
i'm not vibrating like i oughta be
i need a purpose, i can't keep surfing
through this existential misery
now, we're gonna need some real estate
but if i choose my words carefully
think i could fool you that i'm the guru
wait, how do you spell "epiphany"?

before the truth will set you free, it'll piss you off
before you find a place to be, you're gonna lose the plot
too late to tell you now, one ear and right out the other one
'cause all you ever do is chant the same old mantra
yeah 

could i have your attention, please?
it s time to tap into your tragedy
think you could use a new abuser
close your eyes and listen carefully
imagine you're stood on a beach
water gently lapping at your feet
but now you're sinking, what were you thinking?
that's all the time we have this week

before the truth will set you free, it'll piss you off
before you find a place to be, you're gonna lose the plot
too late to tell you now, one ear and right out the other one
'cause all you ever do is chant the same old mantra

and i know this doesn't make a lot of sense
but do you really wanna think all by yourself now?
all i'm asking for's a little bit of faith
you know it's easy to believe
and i know this doesn't make a lot of sense
you know you gotta work the corners of your mind now
all i'm asking for's a little bit of faith
you know it's easy to, so easy to believe

before the truth will set you free, it'll piss you off
before you find a place to be, you're gonna lose the plot
before the truth will set you free, it'll piss you off

there s an infestation in my mind s imagination
i hope that they choke on smoke 'cause i m smoking them out the basement
this is not rap, this is not hip hop
just another attempt to make the voices stop
rapping to prove nothing, just writing to say something
'cause i wasn t the only one who wasn t rushing to saying nothing
this doesn t mean i lost my dream
it s just right now i got a really crazy mind to clean

gangsters don t cry, therefore, therefore i m
mr. misty eyed, therefore i m

can you save, can you save my
can you save my heavydirtysoul?
can you save, can you save my
can you save my heavydirtysoul?
for me, for me, oh
can you save my heavydirtysoul?
for me, for me, oh
can you save my heavydirtysoul?

nah, i didn t understand a thing you said
if i didn t know better, i'd guess you re all already dead
mindless zombies walking around with a limp and a hunch
saying stuff like,  you only live once"
you've got one time to figure it out
one time to twist and one time to shout
one time to think and i say we start now
sing it with me if you know what i m talking about

gangsters don t cry, therefore, therefore i m
mr. misty eyed, therefore i m

can you save, can you save my
can you save my heavydirtysoul?
can you save, can you save my
can you save my heavydirtysoul?
for me, for me, oh
can you save my heavydirtysoul?
for me, for me, oh
can you save my heavydirtysoul?

death inspires me like a dog inspires a rabbit
death inspires me like a dog inspires a rabbit

can you save, can you save my
can you save my heavydirtysoul?
can you save, can you save my
can you save my heavydirtysoul?
for me, for me, oh
can you save my heavydirtysoul?
for me, for me, oh
can you save my heavydirtysoul?

can you save, can you save my, save my
can you save my heavydirtysoul?
can you save, can you save my, save my
can you save my heavydirtysoul?


i want to drive away
in the night, headlights call my name

i, i'll never be, be what you see inside
you say i'm not alone, but i am petrified
you say that you are close, is close the closest star?
you just feel twice as far, you just feel twice as far
and i'll fall
and i'll break
and i'll fake
all i wanna
 hey hey hey hey... 
and i'll fall down
and i'll break down
and i'll fake you out
all i wanna

i'm so afraid
of what you have to say
cause i am quiet now
and silence gives you space

i'll never be, be what you see inside
you say i'm not alone, but i am petrified
you say that you are close, is close the closest star?
you just feel twice as far, you just feel twice as far
and i'll fall
and i'll break
and i'll fake
all i wanna
 hey hey hey hey... 
and i'll fall down
and i'll break down
and i'll fake you out
all i wanna

it's the same game today as it always is
i don't give you space to speak my name explaining this
and the wrists of my mind have the bleeding lines
that remind me of all the times...
i have committed
dirty dirty crimes that are perfectly form fitted
to what i've done and what i'm doing
i'm brewing and losing and spewing and fusing
and believe me, that's what all the kids are doing
what kids are doing
they're killing themselves
they feel they have no control of their prisoner cell
and if you're one of them then you're one of me
and you would do almost anything just to feel free...
am i right?
of course i am, convince me otherwise
it would take all night
before you walk away, there's one more thing i want to say
our brains are sick but that's okay
 i'll fake you out 
 i'll fake you out 
 i'll fake you out 
 i'll break you down 
 i'll fake you out 
and i'll fall  i'll fake you out 
and i'll break
and i'll fake  all all i wanna 
all i wanna
 i'll fake you out 
 i'll fake you out 
 i'll fake you out 
 i'll break you down 
 i'll fake you out 
 i'll fake you out 
 i'll fake you out 
 i'll break you down 
all i wanna
 yeah, and i'll fall
down
and i'll break
down
and i'll fake you out 
all i wanna
 yeah, and i'll fall down
and i'll break down
and i'll fake you out 
all i wanna
i'm so afraid
of what you have to say
cause i am quiet now
and silence gives you space


i'm taking over my body, back in control, no more "shotty"
i bet a lot of me was lost,
"t"'s uncrossed and "i"'s undotted
i fought it a lot and it seems a lot like flesh is all i got
not any more, flesh out the door, swat 
i must've forgot, you can't trust me
i'm open a moment and closed when you show it
before you know it i'm lost at sea
and now that i write and think about it and the story unfolds
you should take my life, you should take my soul

you are surrounding, all my surroundings
sounding down the mountain range of my left side brain
you are surrounding, all my surroundings
twisting the kaleidoscope behind both of my eyes
and i'll be holding on to you
and i'll be holding on to you

remember the moment you know exactly where you're goin'
cause the next moment before you know it
time is slowin' and it's frozen still
and the windowsill looks really nice, right?
you think twice about your life
it probably happens at night, right?
fight it, take the pain, ignite it, tie a noose around your mind
loose enough to breathe fine and tie it to a tree tell it,
"you belong to me, this ain't a noose
this is a leash and i have news for you
you must obey me "

you are surrounding, all my surroundings
sounding down the mountain range of my left side brain
you are surrounding, all my surroundings
twisting the kaleidoscope behind both of my eyes

entertain my faith, entertain my faith
entertain my faith, entertain my faith
entertain my faith, entertain my faith
entertain my faith, entertain my faith
entertain my faith, entertain my faith

lean with it, rock with it, when we gonna stop with it?
lyrics that mean nothing, we were gifted with thought
is it time to move our feet, to an introspective beat?
it ain't the speakers that bump hearts
it's our hearts that make the beat
lean with it, rock with it, when we gonna stop with it?

ooh, yeah

i did my time, and i want out
so effusive, fade, it doesn't cut, the soul is not so vibrant
the reckoning, the sickening
packaging subversion, pseudo sacrosanct perversion
go drill your deserts, go dig your graves
then fill your mouth with all the money you will save
sinking in, getting smaller again
i'm done, it has begun, i'm not the only one

and the rain will kill us all
throw ourselves against the wall
but no one else can see
the preservation of the martyr in me

psychosocial, psychosocial, psychosocial
psychosocial, psychosocial, psychosocial

there are cracks in the road we laid
but where the temple fell, the secrets have gone mad
this is nothing new, but when we killed it all
the hate was all we had
who needs another mess? we could start over
just look me in the eyes and say i'm wrong
now there's only emptiness
venomous, insipid
i think we're done, i'm not the only one

and the rain will kill us all
throw ourselves against the wall
but no one else can see
the preservation of the martyr in me

psychosocial, psychosocial, psychosocial
psychosocial, psychosocial, psychosocial

the limits of the dead
the limits of the dead
the limits of the dead
the limits of the dead

fake anti fascist lie  psychosocial 
i tried to tell you, but  psychosocial 
your purple hearts are giving out   psychosocial 
can't stop a killing idea  psychosocial 
if it's hunting season  psychosocial 
is this what you want?  psychosocial 
i'm not the only one

and the rain will kill us all
throw ourselves against the wall
but no one else can see
the preservation of the martyr in me

keep holding on
when my brain's ticking like a bomb
guess the black thoughts
have come again to get me
sweet bitter words
unlike nothing i have heard
sing along, mockingbird
you don't affect me
that's right 
deliverance of my heart 
please strike 
be deliberate 

wait, i'm coming undone 
irate, i'm coming undone 
too late, i'm coming undone 
what looks so strong, so delicate 
wait, i'm starting to suffocate 
and soon i anticipate 
i'm coming undone 
what looks so strong, so delicate 

choke, choke again
i thought my demons were my friends
pity me in the end
they're out to get me
since i was young
i tasted sorrow on my tongue
and the sweet sugar gun
does not protect me
that's right 
trigger between my eyes 
please strike 
make it quick now 

wait, i'm coming undone 
irate, i'm coming undone 
too late, i'm coming undone 
what looks so strong, so delicate 
wait, i'm starting to suffocate 
and soon i anticipate 
i'm coming undone 
what looks so strong, so delicate 

i'm trying to hold it together
head is lighter than a feather
looks like i'm not getting better
not getting better

wait, i'm coming undone 
irate, i'm coming undone 
too late, i'm coming undone 
what looks so strong so, delicate 
wait, i'm starting to suffocate 
and soon i anticipate 
i'm coming undone 
what looks so strong, so delicate 


something takes a part of me
something lost and never seen
every time i start to believe
something's raped and taken from me, from me

life's gotta always be messing with me
can't they chill and let me be free?
can't i take away all this pain?
i try to every night, all in vain, in vain

sometimes i cannot take this place
sometimes it's my life i can't taste
sometimes i cannot feel my face
you'll never see me fall from grace

something takes a part of me
you and i were meant to be
a cheap fuck for me to lay
something takes a part of me

feeling like a freak on a leash
feeling like i have no release
how many times have i felt diseased?
nothing in my life is free, is free

sometimes i cannot take this place
sometimes it's my life i can't taste
sometimes i cannot feel my face
you'll never see me fall from grace

something takes a part of me
you and i were meant to be
a cheap fuck for me to lay
something takes a part of me...

hey, i'm feeling tired
my time has gone today
you flirt with suicide
sometimes that's okay
do what others say
i'm here standing hollow
falling away from me
falling away from me
day is here fading
that's when i'm insane
i flirt with suicide
sometimes kill the pain
i can't always say
"it's gonna be better tomorrow"
falling away from me
falling away from me

beating me down 
beating me, beating me
down, down
into the ground 
screaming some sound 
beating me, beating me
down, down
into the ground 

falling away from me
it's spinning round and round
falling away from me
it's lost and can't be found
falling away from me
it's spinning round and round
falling away from me
throw it down

beating me down 
beating me, beating me

faster than a bullet, terrifying scream
enraged and full of anger, he's half man and half machine
rides the metal monster, breathing smoke and fire
closing in with vengeance soaring high

he is the painkiller
this is the painkiller

planets devastated, mankind's on its knees
a saviour comes from out the skies in answer to their pleas
through boiling clouds of thunder, blasting bolts of steel
evil's going under deadly wheels

he is the painkiller
this is the painkiller

faster than a laser bullet
louder than an atom bomb
chromium plated boiling metal
brighter than a thousand suns


flying high on rapture, stronger free and brave
nevermore encaptured, they've been brought back from the grave
with mankind resurrected, forever to survive
returns from armageddon to the skies

he is the painkiller
this is the painkiller
wings of steel painkiller
deadly wheels painkiller

he is the painkiller
this is the painkiller
he is the painkiller
this is the painkiller
pain  pain  killer  killer 
pain  pain  killer  killer 


can't stop the painkiller 
pain 

there's a face in the mirror
and you close your eyes
much easier to turn away
than to take a look inside
so you're thinking it's over
walking away
let your little world crash and burn
oh, what a price to pay
didn't anybody tell you
it's not who's right or wrong?
hold the line
is this what's going on?
where you going now?
when your world's turned inside out
isn't love what it's all about?
where you going now?
when you get to the top of the hill
gonna be there yes i will
there's a crack in the mirror
there's a hole in the sun
full moon in the midnight sky
and you feel like you wanna run
so you blow out the candle
and you turn off the light
then you stumble into darkness
do you believe that love is blind?
didn't anybody tell you
it's never too late to try?
hold the line
before you say goodbye
where you going now?
when your world's turned inside out
isn't love what it's all about?
where you going now?
when you get to the top of the hill
gonna be there yes i will
now i'm not talking 'bout what's good for me
and i'm not saying, how you ought to be
but if there is a message shining on through to you
take a little piece of mind
and let your love light shine
didn't anybody tell you
it's never too late to try?
hold the line
before you say goodbye
where you going now?
when your world's turned inside out
isn't love what it's all about?
where you going now?
when you get to the top of the hill
gonna be there yes i will
where you going now?
when your world's turned inside out
isn't love what it's all about?
where you going now?
when you get to the top of the hill
gonna be there yes i will
gonna be there yes i will

you have forsaken all the love you ve taken
sleeping on a razor, there s nowhere left to fall
your body s aching, every bone is breaking
nothing seems to shake it, it just keeps holding on
ah, ah, ah, ah
ah, ah, ah, ah
ah, ah, ah, ah
ah, ah, ah, ah

your soul is able, death is all you cradle
sleeping on the nails, there s nowhere left to fall
you have admired, every man desires
everyone is king when there s no one left to pawn
ah, ah, ah, ah
ah, ah, ah, ah
ah, ah, ah, ah
ah, ah, ah, ah


there is no peace here, war is never cheap, dear
love will never meet it, it just gets sold for parts
you cannot fight it, all the world denies it
open up your eyelids and let your demons run
ah, ah, ah, ah
ah, ah, ah, ah
ah, ah, ah, ah
ah, ah, ah, ah


i thread the needle through, you beat the devil s tattoo
i thread the needle through, you beat the devil s tattoo

fascinating lady
snowflake in the sun
you make me feel so bourgeois
oh, you've captured everyone
i hear you've been a dancer
at some famous paris show
and million dollar lovers
neatly saw you to your door
nineteen fifty seven
sweetheart of the year
the secret of your beauty
was your moontan and your fear
and now you run this city
you're still honey to the flies
attract the in crowd dandies
faraway look in their eyes
you're the bright
nocturnal vanilla queen
your mask is sterile dignity
tell me why, nocturnal vanilla queen
you haunt me even in my dreams
it couldn't be avoided
we were bound to meet
i knew you would drag me down
and toss me off my feet
sweet moments of desire
sweet moments of relief
you blew down my fences
oh, you're natural make believe
you're the bright
nocturnal vanilla queen
your mask is sterile dignity
tell me why, nocturnal vanilla queen
you haunt me even in my dreams

you're the bright
nocturnal vanilla queen
your mask is sterile dignity

remember that song called "kill me"
from vick timm's last lp
too much of a risk for a golden disc
the price he paid for money
ce soir, ce soir
assassination d'un rock 'n' roll star
ce soir, ce soir
assassination d'un rock 'n' roll star
"sing your song, you can't go wrong,"
tempted his business adviser
"no need for alarm, you'll come to no harm."
he didn't mention the sniper 
ce soir, ce soir
assassination d'un rock 'n roll star
the news is read, the meaning spread
one yawn, two yawn, and back to bed
come on, maman, bend down your head
turn off the light and hold me tight
and just sing on, immortal song
fini belle vie
bonne nuit
remember that song called "kill me"
a lecture on political chicanery
a people's rape
recorded on tape
bought shame to the presidency
tonight, tonight
one more point for human right
tonight, tonight
one more point for human right
remember that song "kill me"
once used by a man from galilee
he had nothin' to lose
he was king of the jews
secured his place in history
ce soir, ce soir
assassination d'un provocateur
one yawn, two yawn, and back to bed
turn off the light and hold me tight
the news is read, the voice is spread
come on, maman, bend down your head
and just sing on, immortal song
fini belle vie
vick played the part, with all his heart
he wasn't prepared for the shock
when howling lead bit into his head
a new martyr for the book of rock 
a new martyr for the book of rock
the book of rock
new martyr for the book of rock
ce soir, ce soir

lie with me now
under lemon tree skies
show me the shy, slow smile you keep hidden
by warm brown eyes
catch the sweet hover of lips just barely apart
and wonder at love's sweet ache
and the wild beat of my heart
oh, rhapsody tearing me apart

and i dreamed i was saying goodbye to my child
she was taking a last look at the sea
wading through dreams, up to our knees in warm ocean swells
while bathing belles, soft beneath
hard bitten shells punch their iphones
erasing the numbers of redundant lovers
and search the horizon
and you'll find my child
down by the shore
digging around for a chain or a bone
searching the sand for a relic washed up by the sea
the last refugee


i ponder of something great
my lungs will fill and then deflate
they fill with fire, exhale desire
i know it's dire, my time today

i have these thoughts so often, i ought
to replace that slot with what i once bought
'cause somebody stole my car radio
and now i just sit in silence

sometimes quiet is violent, i find it hard to hide it
my pride is no longer inside
it's on my sleeve, my skin will scream
reminding me of who i killed inside my dream
i hate this car that i'm driving, there's no hiding for me
i'm forced to deal with what i feel
there is no distraction to mask what is real
i could pull the steering wheel

i have these thoughts so often, i ought
to replace that slot with what i once bought
'cause somebody stole my car radio
and now i just sit in silence

i ponder of something terrifying
'cause this time there's no sound to hide behind
i find over the course of our human existence
one thing consists of consistence
and it's that we're all battling fear
oh dear, i don't know if we know why we're here
oh my, too deep   please stop thinking
i liked it better when my car had sound
there are things we can do
but from the things that work there are only two
and from the two that we choose to do
peace will win and fear will lose
and there's faith and there's sleep, we
need to pick one please because
faith is to be awake
and to be awake is for us to think
and for us to think is to be alive
and i will try with every rhyme
to come across like i am dying
to let you know you need to try to think

i have these thoughts so often, i ought
to replace that slot with what i once bought
'cause somebody stole my car radio
and now i just sit in silence

and now i just sit in silence
and now i just sit in silence
and now i just sit
and now i just sit in silence
and now i just sit in silence
and now i just sit in silence
and now i just sit

i ponder of something great
my lungs will fill and then deflate
they fill with fire
exhale desire
i know it's dire
my time today

i have these thoughts so often, i ought
to replace that slot with what i once bought
'cause somebody stole my car radio
and now i just sit in silence

but he didn't know how to word it

i think you should know you're his favourite worst nightmare

d is for desperately trying to simulate
what it was that was alright
three quarters of an hour ago
that had led him to be in a position

it's so cold in this house
open mouth swallowing us
the children sent home from school
will not stop crying
and i know that you're busy, do i know that you care?
you got your finger on the pulse, you got your eyes everywhere
and it hurts all the time when you don't return my calls
and you haven't got the time to remember how it was
it's so cold in this house
it's so cold in this house

i can't eat, i can't sleep
i can't sleep, i can't dream
an aversion to light
got a fear of the ocean

been walking into the furniture
we've got crosses on our eyes
for richer, for poorer, for better, for worse
we've got crosses on our eyes

always there when he needed them
so he buried them underground
alone with the flowers now
proud of his green hands and blood on his shoes
then he prayed for the rain to come
through the cracks in the autumn clouds
armed with a watering can
dreaming of the greenest field the bodies would grow

running around
have you seen greenhands?
he's up past the wall
fooling us all
he s the organic man
with no one to call

and he shops for the groceries
just to talk with the other men
sweating and stammering
living just to reattach before he gets old
what can the soil teach?
what do the bodies learn?
a sad new afternoon
a dreary mark of solitude stuck under his roots

running around
have you seen greenhands?
he's up past the wall
fooling us all
he's the organic man
with no one to call
running around
have you seen greenhands?
he s up past the wall
fooling us all
he's the organic man
with no one to call
no one to call


running around
have you seen greenhands?
he's up past the wall
fooling us all

i jump from thought to thought like a flea jumps to a light
you could give an aspirin the headache of its life
maybe it's the crazy that i'd miss
watering plastic plants in the hope that they'll grow
seeing a message flash and then smashing up my phone
maybe it's the crazy that i'd miss
it won't get better than this

i like the way your brain works, i like the way you try
to run with the wolf pack when your legs are tied
i like the way you turn me inside and out
i like the way you turn
 woo, ooh ooh, ooh ooh
ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh 
i like the way your brain works
 woo, ooh ooh, ooh ooh
ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh 
i like the way your brain works

i want to get college girl drunk tonight
no morning fears, no mountains to climb
they say the best memories are the ones that we forget
like listening to drake at your best friend's swimming pool
floating anti clockwise in a red mushroom
maybe it's the crazy that i'd miss
it won't get better than this

i like the way your brain works, i like the way you try
to run with the wolf pack when your legs are tied
i like the way you turn me inside and out

baby, it's the crazy i like
i think i saw the world turn in your eyes
baby, it's the crazy i like  ah ah, ah 
and maybe it's the bullshit i'd miss
screaming at the moon in black lipstick
maybe it's the bullshit i'd miss
it won't get better than this


down in the waves
she screams again
roar at the door
my mind can't take much more

i could never drown in

they wanna get my
they wanna get my gold on the ceiling
i ain't blind, just a matter of time
before you steal it

clouds covered love's
barb wired snare
strung up, strung out
i just can t go without

here come dick, he's wearing a skirt
here comes jane, y'know she's sporting a chain
same hair, revolution
same build, evolution
tomorrow who's gonna fuss

and they love each other so
androgynous
closer than you know, love each other so
androgynous
don't get him wrong and don't get him mad
he might be a father, but he sure ain't a dad
and she don't need advice that'll center her
she's happy with the way she looks
she's happy with her gender

and they love each other so
androgynous
closer than you know, love each other so
androgynous
mirror image, see no damage
see no evil at all
kewpie dolls and urine stalls
will be laughed at
the way you're laughed at now
now, something meets boy, and something meets girl
they both look the same
they're overjoyed in this world
same hair, revolution
unisex, evolution
tomorrow who's gonna fuss
and tomorrow dick is wearing pants
and tomorrow janie's wearing a dress
future outcasts and they don't last
and today, the people dress the way that they please
the way they tried to do in the last centuries

and they love each other so
androgynous
closer than you know, love each other so
androgynous

you say you stand by your man
tell me something, i don't understand
you said you love me and that's a fact
and then you left me, you said you felt trapped
well some things you can explain away
but the heartache's with me 'til this day
you didn't stand by me, no not at all
you didn't stand by me, no way
all the times when we were close
i'll remember these things the most
i see all my dreams come tumbling down
i can't be happy without you around
so alone i'll keep the wolves at bay
and there's only one thing i can say
you didn't stand by me, no not at all
you didn't stand by me, no way
you must explain why this must be
did you lie when you spoke to me?
did you stand by me?
no, not at all
now i got a job but it don't pay
i need new clothes, i need somewhere to stay
but without all of these things i can do
but without your love i won't make it through
but you don't understand my point of view
i suppose there's nothing i can do
you didn't stand by me, no not at all
you didn't stand by me, no way
you must explain why this must be
did you lie when you spoke to me?
did you stand by me?
you didn't stand by me, no not at all
you didn't stand by me, no way

caroline laughs and
it's raining all day
she loves to be one of the girls
she lives in the place
in the side of our lives
where nothing is
ever put straight
she turns herself round
and she smiles and she says
'this is it'
'that's the end of the joke'
and loses herself
in her dreaming and sleep
and her lovers walk
through in their coats
pretty in pink
isn't she?
pretty in pink
isn't she?
all of her lovers
all talk of her notes
and the flowers
that they never sent
and wasn't she easy
and isn't she
pretty in pink
the one who insists
he was first in the line
is the last to
remember her name
he's walking around
in this dress
that she wore
she is gone
but the joke's the same
pretty in pink
isn't she?
pretty in pink
isn't she?
caroline talks to you
softly sometimes
she says
'i love you' and
'too much'
she doesn't have anything
you want to steal
well
nothing you can touch
she waves
she buttons your shirt
the traffic
is waiting outside
she hands you this coat
she gives you her clothes
these cars collide
pretty in pink
isn't she?
pretty in pink
isn't she?

i know you better than you think i do
you coulda stuck with me
but i guess a girl's gotta do what she has to
every now and then, my name passes your lips
your late night stroll down a memory lane
on your, your finger tips

do you miss me so much?

feeling like i hypnotised you
feel a burning deep inside you
the only thing that satisfies
you miss me so much
and now you're burning with that old flame
yearning for my old game
you tremble when you hear my name
you miss me so much
well, that's too bad

and we go together like a hand and gun
squeeze off a couple rounds
put me away 'til next time you wanna hurt someone
every now and then, you like to empty your clip, no no
then i go right under your belt on your hip

do you miss me so much?

feeling like i hypnotised you
feel a burning deep inside you
the only thing that satisfies
you miss me so much

i want to have all what's left to go
keeping the lies on the fair, the low

if i put a fight i could save the show
it's over now you can take your stuff
i want to have all what's left to go
keeping the lies on the fair, the low
don't rely on me
i've been told to cause no trouble
i've been told
"too caught in time"
i've been told: don't fight
i feel numb, numb, fine
i'd been told
don't rely on me


sometimes i feel like i don't have a partner
sometimes i feel like my only friend
is the city i live in, the city of angels
lonely as i am, together we cry
i drive on her streets 'cause she's my companion
i walk through her hills 'cause she knows who i am
she sees my good deeds and she kisses me windy
well, i never worry, now that is a lie

i don't ever wanna feel like i did that day
but take me to the place i love, take me all the way
i don't ever wanna feel like i did that day
but take me to the place i love, take me all the way, yeah, yeah, yeah

it's hard to believe that there's nobody out there
it's hard to believe that i'm all alone
at least i have her love, the city, she loves me
lonely as i am, together we cry

i don't ever wanna feel like i did that day
but take me to the place i love, take me all the way
i don't ever wanna feel like i did that day
but take me to the place i love, take me all the way, yeah, yeah, yeah
oh, no, no, no, yeah yeah
love me, i say, yeah yeah
one time

under the bridge downtown
is where i drew some blood
under the bridge downtown
i could not get enough
under the bridge downtown
forgot about my love
under the bridge downtown
i gave my life away
yeah yeah yeah
oh, no, no, no, yeah yeah
here i stay yeah yeah
here i stay

i'll bring you the head of the demon
i'm peeling the skin from his face
the life that you lead is inhuman
its cause and effects a disgrace
you're sowing the seeds of a nightmare from hell
your prayers and your demons are tolling the bell
walking through fire, fate's in my hands
waiting for lightning to strike
man on a wire, bearing the brand
waiting for lightning to strike
lightning to strike
twisted dreams that are formed from delusion
the collusion of fear and torment
decimating to stem this contusion
with a power mad freaking intent
you're sowing the seeds of a nightmare from hell
your prayers and your demons lie dead where they fell
walking through fire, fate's in my hands
waiting for lightning to strike
man on a wire, bearing the brand
waiting for lightning to strike
lightning to strike
i'll spin the world around reeling
i have to when mankind's at stake
i might be left broken and bleeding
for it's all in the fight that we make
you're sowing the seeds of a nightmare from hell
your prayers and your demons are tolling the bell
walking through fire, fate's in my hands
waiting for lightning to strike
man on a wire, bearing the brand
waiting for lightning to strike
lightning to strike
lightning will strike 


the sisyphean dreamer
my fibula and femur
hold the weight of the world
 over and over 
i think, therefore i die
anxiety and i, rolling down a mountain
 over and over 
my shoulder holds the weight of the world

yeah, the wind is blowing
volcanoes blowing, my lungs are blowing
 over and over 
who could not win the mistress, wooed the maid
with no sign of a grave
 over and over 
 over and over 
 oh yeah 

hollow body
wine belly perfidy
move like isotta fraschini
 over and over 
the rock 'n' roller, the young and older
rolling back to the stroller
 over and over 
and although you warned me
the gods have all scorned me now

the wind is blowing
volcanoes blowing, my lungs are blowing
 over and over 
who could not win the mistress, wooed the maid
with no sign of a grave
 over and over 
 over and over 
 over and over 

and i'm punished for the passion
only telling 'cause you're asking
and i'm a glutton for the tasking
and the lovers are drowning
and they're never gonna find 'em
'cause theirs ego's gonna blind 'em
 over and over 
woo 
yeah, my shoulder on a boulder
holds the weight of the world
 yeah 

oh, the wind is blowing
volcanoes blowing, my lungs are blowing
 over and over 
who could not win the mistress, wooed the maid
with no sign of a grave
 over and over 
my shoulder holds the weight of the world
 over and over 
 over and over 

the sisyphean dreamer
my fibula and femur
hold the weight of the world
 over and over 
i think, therefore i die
anxiety and i, rolling down a mountain
 over and over 
 over and over 
and although you've warned me
the gods have all scorned me now


it doesn't come that easy anyway
every time i try, it never feels the way it did at the start
this one for my dawgs
that see where i m coming from and know why it's hard
i do it for you
no one can save me this evening
she does her all but i've never been the easiest ride
she says, "it s okay, we know it's alright"
 so i said, "picture it" 

i can see us in a house next year
 you'll be  making your mind up
you can figure out what goes where
 and stay  keeping it real with me all the time
all the while, they can't touch me anyway
so i'll be holding it down with you every day

 oh, yeah 
holding it down  oh 
oh, oh, i'll be holding it down
holding it down  yeah 
oh, oh

i'm so good at falling asleep
grateful for you waking me
if it weren't for you, i would ve stayed here for weeks
and the bed is just upstairs, the only place i feel peace
there s nothing i forgot to do
nowhere that i'ma need to be
there s no one left for me to impress
how am i meant to know what's good
when nothing good on the screen?
it's been the same way for a while now and i'ma come clean
you know that i haven t been inspired since like i was 18
and the extra stress isn't necessary anyway
so the only thing that's worrying is right in front of me in a line
and life is too short to be staying inside
but i didn't realize i ran from the light
and no one can save me, i'm bleeding
i do my best, but i rarely am a regular guy
at least i've got 3 6 4 more days to get it right
 take a seat, picture this 

i can see us in a house next year
you'll be making your mind up
you can figure out what goes where
you'll be keeping it real with me all the time

no distraction, no one's even tryna reach me
well, not until they need something, honestly
and the trouble is
everybody needs something all the fuckin' time  time 
everybody needs something all the fuckin' time
oh yeah

it doesn't happen like this every day
every time i look at her, i feel the way i did at the start
she's holding me up, i'll never depart
all the emotions straight from the heart
she got me all in my feelings
i wouldn't know how to live life if it wasn't with her
i know what it's worth


when everyone you thought you knew
deserts your fight, i'll go with you
you're facin' down a dark hall
i'll grab my light

and go with you, i'll go with you
i'll go with you, i'll go with you
i'll go with you, i'll go with you
i'll go with you, i'll go with you

surrounded and up against a wall
i'll shred 'em all and go with you
when choices end, you must defend
i'll grab my bat

and go with you, i'll go with you
i'll go with you, i'll go with you, yeah

stay with me, no, you don't need to run
stay with me, my blood, you don't need to run
stay with me, no, you don't need to run
stay with me, my blood, you don't need to run

if there comes a day
people posted up at the end of your driveway
they're callin' for your head and they're callin' for your name
i'll bomb down on 'em, i'm comin' through
did they know i was grown with you?
if they're here to smoke, know i'll go with you
just keep it outside, keep it outside, yeah

stay with me, no, you don't need to run

i'll jump right in and pull my pin

and go with you, i'll go with you
i'll go with you, i'll go with you
 you don't need to run 
i'll go with you, i'll go with you
 you don't need to run 
i'll go with you
my blood, i'll go with you, yeah

starry nights, city lights coming down over me
skyscrapers and stargazers in my head
are we we are, are we we are the waiting unknown

lost and found, city bound in my dreams

and screaming
are we we are, are we we are the waiting
and screaming
are we we are, are we we are the waiting

forget me nots and second thoughts live in isolation
heads or tails and fairytales in my mind
are we we are, are we we are the waiting unknown
the rage and love, the story of my life
the jesus of suburbia is a lie

and screaming
are we we are, are we we are the waiting
and screaming
are we we are, are we we are the waiting unknown
are we we are, are we we are the waiting
and screaming
are we we are, are we we are the waiting unknown

uptown girl
she's been living in her uptown world
i bet she's never had a backstreet guy
i bet her momma never told her why
i'm gonna try for an

uptown girl
she's been living in her white bread world
as long as anyone with hot blood can
and now she's looking for a downtown man
that's what i am
and when she knows what
she wants from her time
and when she wakes up
and makes up her mind

she'll see i'm not so tough
just because
i'm in love with an
uptown girl
you know i've seen her in her uptown world
she's getting tired of her high class toys
and all her presents from her uptown boys
she's got a choice
uptown girl
you know i can't afford to buy her pearls
but maybe someday when my ship comes in
she'll understand what kind of guy i've been
and then i'll win
and when she's walking
she's looking so fine
and when she's talking
she'll say that she's mine

she'll say i'm not so tough
just because
i'm in love with an

uptown girl
she's been living in her white bread world
as long as anyone with hot blood can
and now she's looking for a downtown man
that's what i am

a job that slowly kills you
bruises that won't heal
you look so tired, unhappy

a handshake of carbon monoxide

and no alarms and no surprises

you close the door so i can't see
the love you keep inside
the love you keep for me
it fills me up
it feels like living in a dream
it fills me up so i can't see
the love you keep inside
the love you keep for me

i stay to watch you fade away
i dream of you tonight
tomorrow you'll be gone

this song is about you
and my life now without you
and my reasons just for living and forgiving being known
all alone
if you do it well you better do it right
if you're screwed up well you better screw it tight
it's the way that you're living
i'm forgetting what i know
and i know
do you have what you want?
no, you don't
you can do what you want but you won't
how can you live with yourself now that you're all alone?
when you stare at your face in the glass
when you're driving in your car and you crash
do you know where you're going when it's over and done?
 i dedicate this cord to... 


you might kill me with desire
wind me tighter than a wire
it's something that you do to me
i run away like mercury
and i know you think it's rough
when you're trying to patch us up
and i say honey what is love?
you just say i drink too much

maybe i'm defective
or maybe i'm dumb
i'm sorry, so sorry for what i've done
maybe i'm bad natured
or maybe i'm young
i'm sorry, so sorry for what i've done

and i'm the t shirt that i wear
pick the thorns out of my hair
i broke your heart so carelessly
i made the pieces part of me
and now it hurts what we've become
'cause you taught me how to love
it's me who taught you how to stop
and you just say i drink too much

maybe i'm defective
or maybe i'm dumb
i'm sorry, so sorry for what i've done
maybe i'm bad natured
or maybe i'm young
i'm sorry, so sorry for what i've done

i've waited for this
i'm ready for it
i've waited for this
i'm ready for it
i been waiting so long
i've waited for this
i'm ready for it
i've waited for this
i'm ready for it
i been waiting so long

maybe i'm defective
or maybe i'm dumb
i'm sorry, so sorry for what i've done
maybe i'm bad natured
or maybe i'm young
i'm sorry, so sorry for what i've done

you took a part of me
that i really miss
i keep askin' myself
"how long can it go on like this?"
you told yourself a lie
that's all right, i told myself one, too
well, i try to get closer
but i'm still a million miles from you
you took the silver
you took the gold
you left me standin' out in the cold
people ask about you
i didn't tell them everything i knew
well, i try to get closer
but i'm still a million miles from you
i'm driftin' in and out
of dreamless sleep
somewhow my memory's in a ditch
a ditch so deep
i did some many things
i never did intend to do
and i try to get closer
but i'm still a million miles from you
well, i don't dare close my eyes
and i don't dare wink
maybe in the next life
i'll be able to hear myself think
i feel like talkin' to somebody
i just don't know who
well i try to get closer
but i'm still a million miles from you
rock me pretty baby
rock me all at once
rock me for a little while
and rock me for a couple of months
you know, honey, i'll rock you, too
well i try to get closer
but i'm still a million miles from you
well, there's voices in the night
tryin' to be heard
i'm sittin' here listenin' to every
mind pollutin' word
and i know, i know plenty of people
that'd put me up for a day or two
yes, i try to get closer
but i'm still a million miles
yes, i try to get closer
but i'm still a million miles from you


conquest 
he was out to make a conquest
didn't care what harm was done
just as long as he won the prize

conquest 
she was just another conquest
didn't care whose heart was broke
love to him was a joke
'til he looked into her eyes

and then in the strange way things happen
the roles were reversed from that day
the hunted became the huntress
the hunter became the prey

conquest 
now you know who made the conquest
she, with all her female guile
led him helpless down the aisle
she had finally made a conquest

ahh ahh ahh ahhhhh

so goddamn easy to write this
you make it spill on the page
so drunk on yourself, self righteous
the laughing stock of your own fucking sage

but i ain't one to call names
or throw stones in a house of glass
you try me

this is a motherfucking invitation
the only one you could ever need
this is a motherfucking invitation
you try me

just one time you got a reason
heard you had nothing to lose
a pied preacher for the pin eyed congregation
it must be easy to lose

this is a motherfucking invitation
the only one you could ever need
this is a motherfucking invitation
you try me

you can tell the same lie a thousand times
but it never gets anymore true
so close your eyes once more and once more believe
that they all still believe in you
just one time

this is a motherfucking invitation
the only one you could ever need
this is a motherfucking invitation
just one time

count the hours, face the fear
it's haunting me these days
we're past the post and through the door
hail, commercial suicide
kiss the life you left behind
don't let it bother you
you do what it takes to get what you can
last night i thought about
another life and what i'd do
it's hanging over me
i'm sure to break your loving heart
i'm dying to take a walk
down this sugar coated sonic path
cause i've been hanging around for hours
staring at your hologram
outside a northern harbour
digging up the harder times
i might have known that you'd been
tearing up the photographs
standing on your holy ground
lost sight of all i've done
picking round for higher ground
guests out in paradise
with china dolls and better times
the satellite is always overhead
it's watching you
you know it's living hell
i'm solid gone, coming for no one, no one, no one


my body is a cage that keeps me
from dancing with the one i love
but my mind holds the key
my body is a cage that keeps me
from dancing with the one i love
but my mind holds the key

i'm standing on a stage
of fear and self doubt
it's a hollow play
but they'll clap anyway

my body is a cage that keeps me
from dancing with the one i love
but my mind holds the key

you're standing next to me
my mind holds the key

i'm living in an age
that calls darkness light
though my language is dead
still the shapes fill my head
i'm living in an age
whose name i don't know
though the fear keeps me moving
still my heart beats so slow

my body is a cage that keeps me
from dancing with the one i love
but my mind holds the key

you're standing next to me
my mind holds the key
my body is a

my body is a cage
we take what we're given
just because you've forgotten
that don't mean you're forgiven
i'm living in an age
that screams my name at night
but when i get to the doorway
there's no one in sight
i'm living in an age
that laughs
when i'm dancing
with the one i love
but my mind holds the key

you're standing next to me
my mind holds the key

set my spirit free
set my spirit free
set my body free
set my body free
set my spirit free
set my body free


fuck 

fire and caffeine, a lot of nicotine
i'm going to burn, so i better tell you everything
the competition, the superstition
nevermind 'cause you're never going to give in
it's a crisis, just how you like it
the same drama in a different disguise
i'm bound to walk with a target on my back
at least i'm ready for another attack

the lord of lies, the morning star
you had to be set free
opposing sides, your choices are
the negative one and me
yeah

svengali, why are we the enemies?
i never follow, and i never make apologies
your dementias are gonna get ya
because your walls can't support each other
settle for the cynical, you're so political
you're getting ready 'cause the first move is critical
reciprocity, somebody's listening
what did we learn from our time in captivity?

the lord of lies, the morning star
you had to be set free
opposing sides, your choices are
the negative one and me
the negative one and me
i hope you live to see the day
when your world goes up in flames
and as you die, you see my face
you're the only one to blame
yeah
fuck

the prescient, the nascent, the quotient
they all will fall
the cystic, symbolic, condition
systemic
egregious, replete with these lesions
contaminate
succumb to the selfish creation
your failure

no accountability, divisibility
i point a finger, but it's always looking back at me
the centipede's pulling on the mechanism
unearthing scars of the cataclysm
when the innocent begin to circumvent
the color fades, but the picture is vibrant
what do you believe? does it matter now?
turn away, the killer is disavowed

the lord of lies, the morning star
you had to be set free
opposing sides, your choices are
the negative one and me
the negative one and me
i hope you live to see the day
when your world goes up in flames
and as you die, you see my face
you're the only one to blame
the lord of lies, the morning star
you had to be set free
opposing sides, your choices are
the negative one
the negative one
the negative one
the negative one and me
the negative one and me
the negative one and me
yeah



ticking away
the moments that make up the dull day
fritter and waste the hours in an offhand way
kicking around
on a piece of ground in your hometown
waiting for someone or something to show you the way
tired of lying in the sunshine
staying home to watch the rain
you are young and life is long
and there is time to kill today
and then, one day, you find
ten years have got behind you
no one told you when to run
you missed the starting gun


and you run, and you run
to catch up with the sun, but it's sinking
racing around to come up behind you again
the sun is the same
in a relative way, but you're older
shorter of breath, and one day closer to death
every year is getting shorter
never seem to find the time
plans that either come to naught  oh oh 
or half a page of scribbled lines
hanging on in quiet desperation is the english way
the time is gone, the song is over
thought i'd something more to say

home, home again
i like to be here when i can
and when i come home cold and tired
it's good to warm my bones beside the fire
far away across the field
the tolling of the iron bell
calls the faithful to their knees
to hear the softly spoken magic spells


sippin' on straight chlorine
let the vibe slide over me
this beat is a chemical, beat is a chemical
when i leave, don't save my seat
i'll be back when it's all complete
the moment is medical, moment is medical
sippin' on straight chlorine

lovin' what i'm tastin'  woah 
venom on my tongue, dependent at times
poisonous vibrations  woah 
help my body run

i'm runnin' for my life
runnin' for my life

sippin' on straight chlorine
let the vibe slide over me
this beat is a chemical, beat is a chemical
when i leave, don't save my seat
i'll be back when it's all complete
the moment is medical, moment is medical
sippin' on straight chlorine

fall out of formation  woah 
i plan my escape from walls they confined
rebel red carnation  woa a oh 
grows while i decay

i'm runnin' for my life
runnin' for my life
yeah, i'm runnin' for my life
runnin' for my life

hide you in my coat pocket, where i kept my rebel red
i felt i was invincible, you wrapped around my head
now different lives i lead, my body lives on lead
the last two lines may read incorrect until said
the lead is terrible in flavor
but now you double as a paper maker
i despise you sometimes, i love to hate the fight
and you in my life is like

sippin' on straight chlorine
let the vibe slide over me
this beat is a chemical, beat is a chemical
when i leave, don't save my seat
i'll be back when it's all complete
the moment is medical, moment is medical
sippin' on straight chlorine

let the vibe, let the vibe
let the vibe, let the vibe
beat is a chemical, yeah
let the vibe, let the vibe
let the vibe, let the vibe
moment is medical, yeah


i can see that you're giving up
it should not mean that much to me
and i don't know where the rest go
but everybody's been telling me no

but i'll always have a thing for you
i'd move the earth
but nothing made you want me better
there is nothing i can do
but steal the moon
but nothing made you want me better

oh woman oh man
choose a path for a child
great mirrored plans
oh woman oh man
take a devil by the hands through
yellow sands

and i can see that you're giving up
so tell me it should not mean this much to me
and i don't know where the rest goes
everybody's been telling me no

but i'll always have a thing for you
i'd move the earth
but nothing made you want me better
there is nothing i can do
but steal the moon
and nothing made you want me better

oh woman oh man
choose a path for a child
great mirrored plans
oh woman oh man
take a devil by the hands through
yellow sands

woman choose your man
one who understands  oh 
do you really understand?  oh 
do you really understand?
do you really understand?

oh woman oh man
choose a path for a child
great mirrored plans
oh woman oh man
take a devil by the hands through
yellow sands

woman choose your man
one who understands  oh 
do you really understand?  oh 
do you really understand?

in a darkened room
beyond the reach of god's faith
lies the wounded
the shattered remains of love betrayed
and the innocence
of a child is bought and sold
in the name of the damned
the rage of the angels left silent and cold
forgive me please for i know not what i do
how can i keep inside the hurt i know is true
tell me when the kiss
of love becomes a lie
that bears the scar of sin too deep
to hide behind this fear
of running unto you
please let there be light
in a darkened room
all the precious times
have been put to rest again
and the smile of the dawn
brings tainted lust singing my requiem
can i face the day
when i'm tortured in my trust
and watch it crystalize
while my salvation it crumbles to dust
why can't i steer the ship before it hits the storm
i've fallen to the sea but still i swim for shore
tell me when the kiss
of love becomes a lie
that bears the scar of sin too deep
to hide behind this fear
of running unto you
please let there be light
in a darkened room


i've got another confession to make, i'm your fool
everyone's got their chains to break, holdin' you
were you born to resist or be abused?

is someone getting the best
the best, the best, the best of you?
is someone getting the best
the best, the best, the best of you?

are you gone and on to someone new?
i needed somewhere to hang my head without your noose
you gave me something that i didn't have, but had no use
i was too weak to give in, too strong to lose
my heart is under arrest again, but i break loose
my head is giving me life or death, but i can't choose
i swear i'll never give in, i refuse

is someone getting the best
the best, the best, the best of you?
is someone getting the best
the best, the best, the best of you?
has someone taken your faith?
it's real, the pain you feel
you trust, you must confess
is someone getting the best
the best, the best, the best of you?
oh, oh oh, oh oh

has someone taken your faith?
it's real, the pain you feel
the life, the love you'd die to heal
the hope that starts the broken hearts
you trust, you must confess

is someone getting the best
the best, the best, the best of you?
is someone getting the best
the best, the best, the best of you?

i've got another confession, my friend, i'm no fool
i'm getting tired of starting again somewhere new
were you born to resist or be abused?
i swear i'll never give in, i refuse

is someone getting the best
the best, the best, the best of you?
is someone getting the best
the best, the best, the best of you?
has someone taken your faith?
it's real, the pain you feel
you trust, you must confess
is someone getting the best
the best, the best, the best of you?


on a cobweb afternoon in a room full of emptiness
by a freeway, i confess i was lost in the pages
of a book full of death, reading how we'll die alone
and if we're good, we'll lay to rest anywhere we want to go

in your house, i long to be
room by room, patiently
i'll wait for you there, like a stone
i'll wait for you there, alone

and on my deathbed, i will pray to the gods and the angels
like a pagan to anyone who will take me to heaven
to a place i recall, i was there so long ago
the sky was bruised, the wine was bled, and there you led me on

in your house, i long to be
room by room, patiently
i'll wait for you there, like a stone
i'll wait for you there, alone, alone

and on i read, until the day was gone
and i sat in regret of all the things i've done
for all that i've blessed, and all that i've wronged
in dreams until my death, i will wander on

in your house, i long to be
room by room, patiently
i'll wait for you there, like a stone
i'll wait for you there, alone, alone

what can i do?
will i be getting through?
now, that i must try to leave it all behind
did you see what you have done to me?
so hard to justify, slowly it's passing by
forever and one, i will miss you
however i kiss you yet again
way down in neverland
so hard i was trying
tomorrow, i'll still be crying
how could you hide your lies?
your lies
here i am, seeing you once again
my mind's so far away
my heart's so close to stay
too proud to fight
i'm walking back into night
will i ever find someone to believe?
forever and one, i will miss you
however i kiss you yet again
way down in neverland
so hard i was trying
tomorrow, i'll still be crying
how could you hide your lies?
your lies
forever and one, i will miss you
however i kiss you yet again
way down in neverland
so hard i was trying
tomorrow, i'll still be crying
how could you hide your lies?
your lies, your lies

what's left inside him?
don't he remember us?
can't he believe me?
we seemed like brothers
talked for hours last month
about what we wanna be
i sit now with his hand in mine
but i know he can't feel...
no one knows
what's done is done
it's as if he were dead
i'm close with his mother
and she cries endlessly
lord how we miss him
at least what's remembered
it's so important to make best friends in life
but it's hard when my friend sits with blank expressions
no one knows
what's done is done
it's as if he were dead
he as hollow as i alone now
he as hollow as i alone now
he as hollow as i alone now
he as hollow as i alone now
he as hollow as i alone
a shell of my friend
just flesh and bone
there's no soul
he sees no love
i shake my fists at skies above
mad
at god
mad
he as hollow as i converse
i wish he'd waken from this curse
hear my words before it's through
i want to come in after you
my
best friend
my
best friend
whoa yeah
come back 
he as hollow as i alone now
he as hollow as i alone now

times have changed and times are strange
here i come, but i ain't the same
mama, i'm coming home
time's gone by,it seems to be
you could have been a better friend to me
mama, i'm coming home
you took me in and you me drove out
yeah, you had me hypnotized, yeah
lost and found and turned around
by the fire in your eyes
you made me cry, you told me lies
but i can't stand to say goodbye
mama, i'm coming home
i could be right, i could be wrong
it hurts so bad, it's been so long
mama, i'm coming home
selfish love, yeah we're both alone
the ride before the fall, yeah
but i'm gonna take this heart of stone
i've just got to have it all
i've seen your face a hundred times
every day we've been apart
i don't care about the sunshine, yeah
cause mama, mama, i'm coming home
i'm coming home
you took me in and you drove me out
yeah, you had me hypnotized, yeah
lost and found and turned around
by the fire in your eyes
i've seen your face a thousand times
every day we've been apart
i don't care about the sunshine, yeah
cause mama, mama i'm coming home
i'm coming home
i'm coming home
i'm coming home



bury all your secrets in my skin
come away with innocence, and leave me with my sins
the air around me still feels like a cage
and love is just a camouflage for what resembles rage again

so if you love me, let me go
and run away before i know
my heart is just too dark to care
i can't destroy what isn't there
deliver me into my fate
if i'm alone i cannot hate
i don't deserve to have you
ooh my smile was taken long ago
if i can change i hope i never know

i still press your letters to my lips
and cherish them in parts of me that savor every kiss
i couldn't face a life without your light  without your light 
but all of that was ripped apart when you refused to fight

so save your breath, i will not care
i think i made it very clear
you couldn't hate enough to love
is that supposed to be enough?
i only wish you weren't my friend
then i could hurt you in the end
i never claimed to be a saint
ooh my own was banished long ago
it took the death of hope to let you go

oh, oh

so break yourself against my stones
and spit your pity in my soul
you never needed any help
you sold me out to save yourself
and i won't listen to your shame
you ran away, you're all the same
angels lie to keep control
ooh my love was punished long ago
if you still care, don't ever let me know
if you still care, don't ever let me know



i could stay awake just to hear you breathin'
watch you smile while you are sleeping
while you're far away and dreaming
i could spend my life in this sweet surrender
i could stay lost in this moment forever
where every moment spent with you is a moment i treasure

don't want to close my eyes
i don't want to fall asleep
'cause i'd miss you, baby
and i don't wanna miss a thing
'cause even when i dream of you  even when i dream 
the sweetest dream would never do
i'd still miss you, babe
and i don't want to miss a thing

lying close to you feeling your heart beating
and i'm wondering what you're dreaming
wonderin' if it's me you're seeing
then i kiss your eyes and thank god we're together
and i just want to stay with you
in this moment forever
forever and ever

i don't want to close my eyes
i don't want to fall asleep
'cause i'd miss you, baby
and i don't wanna miss a thing
'cause even when i dream of you  even when i dream 
the sweetest dream would never do
i'd still miss you, baby
and i don't want to miss a thing

i don't want to miss one smile
i don't want to miss one kiss
well, i just want to be with you
right here with you, just like this
i just want to hold you close
i feel your heart so close to mine
and just stay here in this moment
for all the rest of time
yeah  yeah

don't want to close my eyes
don't want to fall asleep
'cause i'd miss you, baby
and i don't wanna miss a thing

in my smoked out boring room
my hair is shagging in my eyes
dragging my feet to hit the street tonight
to drive along these shit town lights

i'm not growing up
i'm just burning out
and i stepped in line
to walk amongst the dead

apathy has rained on me
now i'm feeling like a soggy dream
so close to drowning but i don't mind
i've lived inside this mental cave
throw my emotions in the grave
hell, who needs them anyway

i'm not growing up
i'm just burning out
and i stepped in line
to walk amongst the dead
i'm not growing up
i'm just burning out
and i stepped in line
to walk amongst the dead
dead


i'm not growing up
i'm just burning out
and i stepped in line
to walk amongst the dead
i'm not growing up
i'm just burning out
and i stepped in line
to walk amongst the dead
dead

i walk a lonely road
the only one that i have ever known
don't know where it goes
but it's home to me, and i walk alone
i walk this empty street
on the boulevard of broken dreams
where the city sleeps
and i'm the only one, and i walk alone
i walk alone, i walk alone
i walk alone, i walk a 

my shadow's the only one that walks beside me
my shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
sometimes i wish someone out there will find me
'til then i walk alone

i'm walking down the line
that divides me somewhere in my mind
on the borderline
of the edge and where i walk alone
read between the lines
what's fucked up, and everything's all right
check my vital signs
to know i'm still alive, and i walk alone
i walk alone, i walk alone
i walk alone, i walk a 

my shadow's the only one that walks beside me
my shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
sometimes i wish someone out there will find me
'til then i walk alone
i walk alone, i walk a

call you up in the middle of the night
like a firefly without a light
you were there like a blowtorch burning
i was a key that could use a little turning
so tired that i couldn't even sleep
so many secrets i couldn't keep
promised myself i wouldn't weep
one more promise i couldn't keep
it seems no one can help me now
i'm in too deep
there's no way out
this time i have really led myself astray
runaway train never going back
wrong way on a one way track
seems like i should be getting somewhere
somehow i'm neither here nor there
can you help me remember how to smile?
make it somehow all seem worthwhile
how on earth did i get so jaded?
life's mystery seems so faded
i can go where no one else can go
i know what no one else knows
here i am, just drowning in the rain
with a ticket for a runaway train
and everything seems cut and dry
day and night
earth and sky
somehow i just don't believe it
runaway train never going back
wrong way on a one way track
seems like i should be getting somewhere
somehow i'm neither here nor there
bought a ticket for a runaway train
like a madman laughing at the rain
a little out of touch, a little insane
it's just easier than dealing with the pain
runaway train never going back
wrong way on a one way track
seems like i should be getting somewhere
somehow i'm neither here nor there
runaway train never coming back
runaway train tearing up the track
runaway train burning in my veins
runaway but it always seems the same


billy ray was a preacher's son
and when his daddy would visit he'd come along
when they gathered around and started talkin'
that's when billy would take me walkin'
out through the back yard we'd go walkin'
then he'd look into my eyes
lord knows, to my surprise

the only one who could ever reach me
was the son of a preacher man
the only boy who could ever teach me
was the son of a preacher man
yes he was
he was, ooh
yes he was

bein' good isn't always easy
no matter how hard i try
when he started sweet talkin' to me
he'd come'n tell me "everything is all right"
he'd kiss and tell me "everything is all right"
can i get away again tonight?

the only one who could ever reach me
was the son of a preacher man
the only boy who could ever teach me
was the son of a preacher man
yes he was
he was, ooh
yes he was

how well i remember
the look that was in his eyes
stealin' kisses from me on the sly
takin' time to make time
tellin' me that he's all mine
learnin' from each other's knowin'
lookin' to see how much we've grown and

the only one who could ever reach me
was the son of a preacher man
the only boy who could ever teach me
was the son of a preacher man
yes he was,  was 
he was,  was 
ooh, yes he was
 the only one who could ever reach me 
he was the sweet talkin' son of a preacher man
 the only boy who could ever teach me 
i kissed the son of a preacher man
 the only one who could ever move me 
the sweet lovin' son of a preacher man
 the only one who could ever groove me
was the son of a preacher man
the only one who could ever reach me
was the son of a preacher man

the road is long
with many a winding turn
that leads us to who knows where?
who knows where?
but i'm strong
strong enough to carry him
he ain't heavy, he's my brother
so on we go
his welfare is my concern
no burden is he to bear
we'll get there
for i know
he would not encumber me
he ain't heavy, he's my brother
if i'm laden at all
i'm laden with sadness
that everyone's heart
isn't filled with the gladness
of love for one another
it's a long, long road
from which there is no return
while we're on the way to there
why not share?
and the load
doesn't weigh me down at all
he ain't heavy, he's my brother
he's my brother
he ain't heavy, he's my brother

we took a vow in summertime
now we find ourselves in late december
i believe that new year's eve
will be the perfect time for their great surrender
but they don't remember

anger wants a voice, voices wanna sing
singers harmonize 'til they can't hear anything
i thought that i was free from all that questionin'
but every time a problem ends, another one begins

and the stone walls of harmony hall bear witness
anybody with a worried mind could never forgive the sight
of wicked snakes inside a place you thought was dignified
i don't wanna live like this, but i don't wanna die

ooh, ooh, ooh
i don't wanna live like this, but i don't wanna die

within the halls of power lies a nervous heart that beats
like a young pretender's
beneath these velvet gloves i hide
the shameful, crooked hands of a moneylender
'cause i still remember

anger wants a voice, voices wanna sing
singers harmonize 'til they can't hear anything
i thought that i was free from all that questionin'
but every time a problem ends, another one begins

and the stone walls of harmony hall bear witness
anybody with a worried mind could never forgive the sight
of wicked snakes inside a place you thought was dignified
i don't wanna live like this, but i don't wanna die

ooh, ooh, ooh
i don't wanna live like this, but i don't wanna die


and the stone walls of harmony hall bear witness
anybody with a worried mind could never forgive the sight
of wicked snakes inside a place you thought was dignified
i don't wanna live like this, but i don't wanna die

ooh, ooh, ooh
i don't wanna live like this, but i don't wanna die

and the stone walls of harmony hall bear witness
anybody with a worried mind could never forgive the sight
of wicked snakes inside a place you thought was dignified
i don't wanna live like this, but i don't wanna die

hard times in the city
i get over, i get under
don't it make you feel dizzy?
all the anger
i don't mean to be jealous
but my eyes have seen you with fellas
i find it hard to be part of the city when it's so unjust
it makes me feel like i wanna die, that's why

i don't drink alone
 i never drink alone 
i got a big fine mamma at home
 i just can't get enough 
she calls me chicken bone
 my midnight tone 
and then she rolls me like a stone
 i just can't get enough 

bricked up in the city and the buildings are laughing
pay check burning my pocket
going to buy a gold chain and a locket
makes me feel like i'm gonna lie, that's why

i don't drink alone
 i never drink alone 
i got a big fine mamma at home
 i just can't get enough 
she calls me chicken bone
 my midnight tone 
and then she rolls me like a stone
 i just can't get enough 

she sings when it's over
when it's over she sings
she doesn't worry as i walk out the door
'cos tomorrow i'll bring
two small chocolates and a bottle of wine, a very nice time
all my pennies, my farthings for my mortgage that i'm under
at her place all the sorrows of the world can wait 'til tomorrow
she makes me feel like it's all alright, that's why

i don't drink alone
 i never drink alone 
i got a big fine mamma at home
 i just can't get enough 
she calls me chicken bone
 my midnight tone 
and the she rolls me like a stone
 i just can't get enough

a growing sickness in the heart
defective, lack of control
the cure is somewhere in the silence
but i'm crushed by the noise inside

don't lock the door on me
you'd kill me, face down, dead
another part of me falls for you

another day in the dark
no, no
stranded in the night
stranded in the cold

don't lock the door on me
you'd kill me, face down, dead
another part of you gone to waste
please hear me out
you kill me, face down, dead
another day in the dark

don't lock the door on me
you'd kill me, face down, dead
another part of you gone to waste
please hear me out
you kill me, face down, dead
another day in the dark

i push my fingers into my eyes
it's the only thing that slowly stops the ache
but it's made of all the things i have to take
jesus, it never ends, it works its way inside
if the pain goes on

i have screamed until my veins collapsed
i've waited as my time's elapsed
now all i do is live with so much fate
i've wished for this, i've bitched at that
i've left behind this little fact
you cannot kill what you did not create
i've gotta say what i've gotta say
and then i swear i'll go away
but i can't promise you'll enjoy the noise
i guess i'll save the best for last
my future seems like one big past
you're left with me 'cause you left me no choice

i push my fingers into my eyes
it's the only thing that slowly stops the ache
if the pain goes on, i'm not gonna make it

put me back together or separate the skin from bone
leave me all the pieces, then you can leave me alone
tell me the reality is better than the dream
but i found out the hard way, nothing is what it seems

i push my fingers into my eyes
it's the only thing that slowly stops the ache
but it's made of all the things i have to take
jesus, it never ends, it works its way inside
if the pain goes on, i'm not gonna make it

all i've got, all i've got is insane
all i've got, all i've got is insane
all i've got, all i've got is insane
all i've got, all i've got is insane
all i've got, all i've got is insane

i did my time, and i want out
so effusive, fade, it doesn't cut, the soul is not so vibrant
the reckoning, the sickening
packaging subversion, pseudo sacrosanct perversion
go drill your deserts, go dig your graves
then fill your mouth with all the money you will save
sinking in, getting smaller again
i'm done, it has begun, i'm not the only one

the preservation of the martyr in me

psychosocial, psychosocial, psychosocial
psychosocial, psychosocial, psychosocial

there are cracks in the road we laid
but where the temple fell, the secrets have gone mad
this is nothing new, but when we killed it all
the hate was all we had
who needs another mess? we could start over
just look me in the eyes and say i'm wrong
now there's only emptiness
venomous, insipid
i think we're done, i'm not the only one

and the rain will kill us all
throw ourselves against the wall
but no one else can see
the preservation of the martyr in me

psychosocial, psychosocial, psychosocial
psychosocial, psychosocial, psychosocial

the limits of the dead
the limits of the dead

sheets of empty canvas, untouched sheets of clay
were laid spread out before me as her body once did
all five horizons revolved around her soul
as the earth to the sun
now the air i tasted and breathed has taken a turn, ooh
and all i taught her was everything
ooh, i know she gave me all that she wore

and now my bitter hands chafe beneath the clouds
of what was everything
oh, the pictures have all been washed in black
tattooed everything

i take a walk outside
i'm surrounded by some kids at play
i can feel their laughter, so why do i sear
oh and twisted thoughts that spin round my head
i'm spinning, oh i'm spinning
how quick the sun can drop away

and now my bitter hands cradle broken glass
of what was everything
all the pictures have all been washed in black
tattooed everything

all the love gone bad turned my world to black
tattooed all i see, all that i am, all i'll be yeah
oh oh ooh

came in from a rainy thursday
on the avenue
thought i heard you talking softly
i turned on the lights, the tv
and the radio
still i can't escape the ghost of you
what has happened to it all?
crazy, some'd say
where is the life that i recognize?
gone away
but i won't cry for yesterday
there's an ordinary world
somehow i have to find
and as i try to make my way
to the ordinary world
i will learn to survive
passion or coincidence
once prompted you to say
"pride will tear us both apart"
well now pride's gone out the window
cross the rooftops
run away
left me in the vacuum of my heart
what is happening to me?
crazy, some'd say
where is my friend when i need you most?
gone away
but i won't cry for yesterday
there's an ordinary world
somehow i have to find
and as i try to make my way
to the ordinary world
i will learn to survive
papers in the roadside
tell of suffering and greed
fear today, forgot tomorrow
ooh, here beside the news
of holy war and holy need
ours is just a little sorrowed talk
 just blown away 
and i don't cry for yesterday
there's an ordinary world
somehow i have to find
and as i try to make my way
to the ordinary world
i will learn to survive
every world
is my world
 i will learn to survive 
any world
is my world
 i will learn to survive 
any world
is my world
every world
is my world...

know it sounds funny
but, i just can't stand the pain
girl, i'm leaving you tomorrow
seems to me girl
you know i've done all i can
you see i begged, stole, and i borrowed   yeah 

ooh that's why i'm easy
i'm easy like sunday morning
that's why i'm easy
i'm easy like sunday morning 
i wanna be high, so high
i wanna be free to know
the things i do are right
i wanna be free
just me  whoa, oh  baby 
ugh 




too alarming now to talk about
take your pictures down and shake it out
truth or consequence, say it aloud
use that evidence, race it around

there goes my hero
watch him as he goes
there goes my hero
he's ordinary

don't the best of them bleed it out
while the rest of them peter out
truth or consequence, say it aloud
use that evidence, race it around

there goes my hero
watch him as he goes
there goes my hero
he's ordinary

kudos, my hero
leaving all the best

and shovin' into overdrive

highway to the danger zone

until you get it on the red line overload
you'll never know what you can do
until you get it up as high as you can go

out along the edges
always where i burn to be
the further on the edge
the hotter the intensity

highway to the danger zone

undo these chains, my friend, i'll show you the rage i've hidden
perish the sacrament, swallow but nothing's forgiven
you and i can't decide which of us was taken for granted
make amends, some of us are destined to be outlived

step inside, see the devil in i
too many times we've let it come to this
step inside, see the devil in i
you'll realize i'm not your devil anymore

under the words of men, something is tempting the father
where is your will, my friend? insatiates never even bother
you and i, wrong or right, traded a lie for the leverage
in between the lens in light, you're not what you seem

step inside, see the devil in i
too many times we've let it come to this
step inside, see the devil in i
you'll realize i'm not your devil
i'm not your devil anymore

your station is abandoned
fooled you 'cause i know what you've done
sensation, deprivation
you should've burned when you turned on everyone

so step inside, see the devil in i
too many times we've let it come to this
step inside, see the devil in i
i know you'll find your answers in the end
step inside, see the devil in i
you'll realize i'm not your devil anymore

so step inside
step inside
see the devil in i
see the devil in i


to pick up the tip doesn't mean a lot
fiddle inside your drawers
if we own the night, then spread it out
or pack up without a clue

well, caused by their own
and by default
time to vamanos

like your face getting forced to the floor

then i got a taste of the benefits
five foot and change
there's no better way to hash it out
so let's set up your time to fail

well course now the cracks
should we intervene?
i hold this albatross

like your face getting forced to the floor
and either way, you're way too close to it all

pay up, never wait 'em out
clever, madoff, take it all
take it all
 your mouth blessed 
take it all the way, right back down
 clueless mess 
pay up, never take it all
take it all
 chorus]
like your face getting forced to the floor
 in a league of your own 
and either way, you're way too close to it all
 you cannot veto the world 

like your face  like your face 
getting forced  getting forced  to the floor
 in a league of your own 
and either way  and either way 
you're way too close to it all
too close to it all

harrowed the light i could face the bulb
i'm on a tide like a perished boat
and i'd keep you mine in a phasing tone
carrying my lies like an aeolus son
i wanted time, i could've faired the rope
keeping alive all the parables
i want to have all what's left to go
saving a life i can't bare to show
don't rely on me
if i put a fight i could save the show
it's over now you can take your stuff
i want to have all what's left to go
keeping the lies on the fair, the low
don't rely on me
i've been told to cause no trouble
i've been told
"too caught in time"
i've been told: don't fight
i feel numb, numb, fine
i'd been told
don't rely on me

over bridge of sighs
to rest my eyes in shades of green
under dreamin' spires
to itchycoo park, that's where i've been
what did you do there?
i got high
what did you feel there?
well i cried
but why the tears there?
i'll tell you why
it's all too beautiful
it's all too beautiful
it's all too beautiful
it's all too beautiful
i feel inclined to blow my mind
get hung up feed the ducks with a bun
they all come out to groove about
be nice and have fun in the sun
tell you what i'll do  what will you do? 
i'd like to go there now with you
you can miss out school  won't that be cool 
why go to learn the words of fools?
what will we do there?
we'll get high
what will we touch there?
we'll touch the sky
but why the tears then?
i'll tell you why
it's all too beautiful
it's all too beautiful
it's all too beautiful
it's all too beautiful
i feel inclined to blow my mind
get hung up feed the ducks with a bun
they all come out to groove about
be nice and have fun in the sun

it's all too beautiful
ha  it's all too beautiful
it's all too beautiful
it's all too beautiful

ocean blue
what have i done to you?
cut so deep
yet growing through and through
drawn apart new york and london
all i see now are distant drumlins
the roads i knew became a city
and i wonder, will you wait for me?

although
i'm far away
i know i'll stay, i know i'll stay right there with you
though
it might be too late
what would you say? what would you say? what would you do?
i built a hive became one with the bees
but we fell like rain got lost into the sea
if i don't know the wind will carry me
so just hold tight

although
i'm far away
i know i'll stay, i know i'll stay right there with you
though
it might be too late
what would you say? what would you say? what would you do?
over and over many setting suns
i have run, i have waited for the rain to come
when through that mist i see the shape of you
and i know, and i know that i'm in love with you

although
i'm far away
i know i'll stay, i know i'll stay right there with you
though
it might be too late
what would you say? what would you say? what would you do?

another friday night of agitation
so many people but no conversation
all the bands they know
and they're so outgoing

buy your tickets for the execution
the kids are lines up for a prosecution
and they've hung us all
on their bedroom walls

and as entertaining as it is
give up the freak show binge
and rest

oh now, undertaker
looks like we're getting out to explore
death pop, music maker
filling hades left to right

oh now, undertaker

i've never seen so many pale males
but i'm the dullest in this fairytale
in my khaki crown
and colourless gown

innocent and happy smiles
so amused and so unaware
of death

oh now, undertaker
looks like we're getting out to explore
death pop, music maker
filling hades left to right

i walk a lonely road
the only one that i have ever known
don't know where it goes
but it's home to me, and i walk alone
i walk this empty street
on the boulevard of broken dreams
where the city sleeps
and i'm the only one, and i walk alone
i walk alone, i walk alone
i walk alone, i walk a 

my shadow's the only one that walks beside me
my shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
sometimes i wish someone out there will find me
'til then i walk alone

i'm walking down the line
that divides me somewhere in my mind
on the borderline
of the edge and where i walk alone
read between the lines
what's fucked up, and everything's all right
check my vital signs
to know i'm still alive, and i walk alone
i walk alone, i walk alone
i walk alone, i walk a 

my shadow's the only one that walks beside me
my shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
sometimes i wish someone out there will find me
'til then i walk alone
i walk alone, i walk a 


i walk this empty street
on the boulevard of broken dreams
where the city sleeps
and i'm the only one, and i walk a 

my shadow's the only one that walks beside me
my shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
sometimes i wish someone out there will find me
'til then i walk alone



i've got another confession to make, i'm your fool
everyone's got their chains to break, holdin' you
were you born to resist or be abused?

is someone getting the best
the best, the best, the best of you?
is someone getting the best
the best, the best, the best of you?

are you gone and on to someone new?
i needed somewhere to hang my head without your noose
you gave me something that i didn't have, but had no use
i was too weak to give in, too strong to lose
my heart is under arrest again, but i break loose
my head is giving me life or death, but i can't choose
i swear i'll never give in, i refuse

is someone getting the best
the best, the best, the best of you?
is someone getting the best
the best, the best, the best of you?
has someone taken your faith?
it's real, the pain you feel
you trust, you must confess
is someone getting the best
the best, the best, the best of you?
oh, oh oh, oh oh

has someone taken your faith?
it's real, the pain you feel
the life, the love you'd die to heal
the hope that starts the broken hearts
you trust, you must confess

is someone getting the best
the best, the best, the best of you?
is someone getting the best
the best, the best, the best of you?

i've got another confession, my friend, i'm no fool
i'm getting tired of starting again somewhere new
were you born to resist or be abused?
i swear i'll never give in, i refuse

is someone getting the best
the best, the best, the best of you?
is someone getting the best
the best, the best, the best of you?
has someone taken your faith?
it's real, the pain you feel
you trust, you must confess
is someone getting the best
the best, the best, the best of you?

and you should always know
wherever you may go
no matter where you are
i never will be far away

goodnight, my angel
now it's time to sleep
and still so many things i want to say
remember all the songs you sang for me
when we went sailing on an emerald bay
and like a boat out on the ocean
i'm rocking you to sleep
the water's dark
and deep inside this ancient heart
you'll always be a part of me

goodnight, my angel
now it's time to dream
and dream how wonderful your life will be
someday your child may cry
and if you sing this lullabye
then in your heart
there will always be a part of me

someday we'll all be gone
but lullabyes go on and on
they never die
that's how you
and i
will be

welcome to the room of people
who have rooms of people that they loved one day
locked away
just because we check the guns at the door
doesn't mean our brains will change from hand grenades
you're lovin' on the psychopath sitting next to you
you're lovin' on the murderer sitting next to you
you'll think, "how'd i get here, sitting next to you?"
but after all i've said, please don't forget

all my friends are heathens, take it slow
wait for them to ask you who you know
please don't make any sudden moves
you don't know the half of the abuse

we don't deal with outsiders very well
they say newcomers have a certain smell
you have trust issues, not to mention
they say they can smell your intentions
you're lovin' on the freakshow sitting next to you
you'll have some weird people sitting next to you
you'll think "how did i get here, sitting next to you?"
but after all i've said, please don't forget
 watch it, watch it 

all my friends are heathens, take it slow  in the city, boy, in the city

why'd you come? you knew you should have stayed  it's blasphemy 
i tried to warn you just to stay away  wouldn't listen to me 
and now they're outside ready to bust  to bust   and guess what 
it looks like you might be one of us


i took my love and i took it down
i climbed a mountain and i turned around
and i saw my reflection in the snow covered hills
till the landslide brought me down
oh, mirror in the sky
what is love?
can the child within my heart rise above?
can i sail through the changing ocean tides?
can i handle the seasons of my life?
hmmmm

well, i've been afraid of changing
'cause i've built my life around you
but time makes you bolder
even children get older
i'm getting older too

well, i've been afraid of changing

but time makes you bolder
even children get older
and i'm getting older too
oh, i'm getting older too

i took my love, i took it down
oh if you climb a mountain and turned around
and if you see my reflection in the snow covered hills
well the landslide will bring you down
and if you see my reflection in the snow covered hills
well the landslide will bring you down
oh, the landslide will bring it down


jessie is a friend
yeah, i know, he's been a good friend of mine
but lately something's changed that ain't hard to define
jessie's got himself a girl, and i wanna make her mine

and she's watching him with those eyes
and she's lovin' him with that body
i just know it
and he's holding her in his arms late, late at night

you know i wish that i had jessie's girl
i wish that i had jessie's girl
where can i find a woman like that?

i'll play along with this charade
that doesn't seem to be a reason to change
you know i feel so dirty when they start talking cute
i wanna tell her that i love her, but the point is probably moot

cause she's watching him with those eyes
and she's lovin' him with that body
i just know it
and he's holding her in his arms late, late at night

you know i wish that i had jessie's girl
i wish that i had jessie's girl
where can i find a woman like that?
like jessie's girl
i wish that i had jessie's girl
where can i find a woman...
where can i find a woman like that?

and i'm lookin' in the mirror all the time
wonderin' what she don't see in me
i've been funny; i've been cool with the lines
ain't that the way love's supposed to be?

tell me where can i find a woman like that?
you know i wish that i had jessie's girl
i wish that i had jessie's girl
i want jessie's girl
where can i find a woman like that?
like jessie's girl
i wish that i had jessie's girl
i want, i want jessie's girl

i am an old woman named after my mother
my old man is another child that's grown old
if dreams were lightning, thunder were desire
this old house would have burnt down a long time ago

make me an angel that flies from montgomery
make me a poster of an old rodeo
just give me one thing that i can hold on to
to believe in this living is just a hard way to go
when i was a young girl well, i had me a cowboy
he weren't much to look at, just free rambling man
but that was a long time and no matter how i try
the years just flow by like a broken down dam

make me an angel that flies from montgomery
make me a poster of an old rodeo
just give me one thing that i can hold on to
to believe in this living is just a hard way to go
there's flies in the kitchen. i can hear 'em, they're buzzing
and i ain't done nothing since i woke up today
how the hell can a person go to work in the morning
and come home in the evening and have nothing to say

make me an angel that flies from montgomery
make me a poster of an old rodeo
just give me one thing that i can hold on to
to believe in this living is just a hard way to go

i pictured a rainbow
you held it in your hands
i had flashes
but you saw the plan
i wandered out in the world for years
while you just stayed in your room
i saw the crescent
you saw the whole of the moon
the whole of the moon
you were there in the turnstiles
with the wind at your heels
you stretched for the stars
and you know how it feels
to reach too high
too far
too soon
you saw the whole of the moon
i was grounded
while you filled the skies
i was dumbfounded by truth
you cut through lies
i saw the rain dirty valley
you saw brigadoon
i saw the crescent
you saw the whole of the moon
the whole of the moon
i spoke about wings
you just flew
i wondered i guessed and i tried
you just knew
i sighed
... but you swooned 
i saw the crescent
you saw the whole of the moon
with a torch in your pocket
and the wind at your heels
you climbed on the ladder
and you know how it feels
to get too high
too far too soon
you saw the whole of the moon
the whole of the moon 
unicorns and cannonballs
palaces and piers
trumpets towers and tenements
wide oceans full of tears
flags rags ferryboats
scimitars and scarves
every precious dream and vision
underneath the stars
you climbed on the ladder
with the wind in your sails
you came like comet
blazing your trail
too high too far too soon
you saw the whole of the moon

it is the night
my body's weak
i'm on the run
no time to sleep
i've got to ride
ride like the wind
to be free again
and i've got such a long way to go
to make it to the border of mexico
so i'll ride like the wind
ride like the wind
i was born the son of a lawless man
always spoke my mind with a gun in my hand
lived nine lives
gunned down ten
gonna ride like the wind
and i've got such a long way to go
to make it to the border of mexico
so i'll ride like the wind
ride like the wind
accused and tried and told to hang
i was nowhere in sight when the church bells rang
never was the kind to do as i was told
gonna ride like the wind before i get old
it is the night
my body's weak
i'm on the run
no time to sleep
i've got to ride
ride like the wind
to be free again
and i've got such a long way to go
to make it to the border of mexico
so i'll ride like the wind
ride like the wind
and i've got a long way to go
to make it to the border of mexico
so i'll ride like the wind
ride like the wind
gonna ride like the wind
ride
gonna ride like the wind
gonna ride

when i woke up this morning, things were looking bad
seem like total silence was the only friend i had
bowl of oatmeal tried to stare me down and won
and it was twelve o'clock before i realized
that i was having no fun
ah, but fortunately i have the key to escape reality
and you may see me tonight with an illegal smile
it don't cost very much, but it lasts a long while
won't you please tell the man i didn't kill anyone
no i'm just trying to have me some fun
last time i checked my bankroll, it was getting thin
sometimes it seems like the bottom
is the only place i've been
chased a rainbow down a one way street, dead end
and all my friends turned out to be insurance salesmen
ah, but fortunately i have the key to escape reality
and you may see me tonight with an illegal smile
it don't cost very much, but it lasts a long while
won't you please tell the man i didn't kill anyone
no i'm just trying to have me some fun
well, i sat down in my closet with all my overalls
trying to get away from all the ears inside my walls
i dreamed the police heard
everything i thought, what then
well i went to court and the judge's name was hoffman
ah, but fortunately i have the key to escape reality
and you may see me tonight with an illegal smile
it don't cost very much, but it lasts a long while
won't you please tell the man i didn't kill anyone
no i'm just trying to have me some fun
well done
hot dog bun
my sister's a nun


lately it's hard to let you know that i'll never learn
i am explosive and volatile, i'm on the turn

it's time to squirm, i've backed into a wall
my cage has spilled it's contents on the floor
my grave concern's i can't ignore the past
i'll look into the future to make it last

i am explosive and volatile, i'm on the turn
so i'm gonna howl like an animal
'cause lately it's hard to let you know...

there's no return and there's no one to call
i picked a phone connected to the gods
my stitches burst but don't produce a scar
why can't i see this time what's done is done?

i'm never gonna sleep again  i'm never gonna sleep again 
i get to do it all wrong  i get to do it all wrong 
i'm never gonna sleep again, again again, again...

'cause baby it's hard to let you know that i'll never learn
 i got the rage, i always got the rage 
i am explosive and volatile, i'm on the turn
 i got the rage, i always got the rage 
so i'm gonna howl like an animal  like an animal 
'cause lately it's hard to let you know
that i'll never learn learn learn learn...

at home drawin' pictures of mountain tops
with him on top, lemon yellow sun
arms raised in a "v"
and the dead lay in pools of maroon below

daddy didn't give attention
to the fact that mommy didn't care
king jeremy the wicked
ruled his world

jeremy spoke in class today
jeremy spoke in class today

clearly i remember picking on the boy
seemed a harmless little fuck
but we unleashed a lion
gnashed his teeth and bit the recess lady's breast
how could i forget?
and he hit me with a surprise left
my jaw left hurting, dropped wide open
just like the day, oh, like the day i heard

daddy didn't give affection, no
and the boy was something that mommy wouldn't wear
king jeremy the wicked
ruled his world

jeremy spoke in class today
jeremy spoke in class today
jeremy spoke in class today

try to forget this  try to forget this 
try to erase this  try to erase this 
from the blackboard

jeremy spoke in class today
jeremy spoke in class today
jeremy spoke in, spoke in
jeremy spoke in, spoke in
jeremy spoke in class today
 spoke in, spoke in, spoke in... 
 spoke in, spoke in, spoke in... 
 spoke in, spoke in, spoke in... 


down in the waves
she screams again
roar at the door
my mind can't take much more

i could never drown in

they wanna get my
they wanna get my gold on the ceiling
i ain't blind, just a matter of time
before you steal it
it's all right, ain't no guarding my high

clouds covered love's
barb wired snare
strung up, strung out
i just can t go without

i could never drown in

they wanna get my
they wanna get my gold on the ceiling
i ain't blind, just a matter of time
before you steal it
it's all right, ain't no guarding my high
they wanna get my
they wanna get my
gold on the ceiling
i ain't blind, just a matter of time
before you steal it
it's all right, ain't no guarding my high


cold fire feeling, is the cold fire feeling in my bones
skylines breathing as the sun lies beating down the door

i'm tired of watching the shadows on the wall
my eyes are foreseeing
the shackles open, we're finally free to bolt
if you're done with believing

hold my flame and set alight
hold my fire screaming inside
hold my flame and set alight
hold my fire screaming inside out
hold my flame and set alight
hold my fire screaming inside
hold my flame and set alight
hold my fire screaming inside out

found true meaning, now my head starts spinning out the cave
you won't come with me cause you're just too comfortable in chains

i'm tired of watching the shadows on the wall
my eyes are foreseeing
the shackles open, we're finally free to bolt
if you're done with believing

hold my flame and set alight
hold my fire screaming inside
hold my flame and set alight
hold my fire screaming inside out
hold my flame and set alight
hold my fire screaming inside

you know it's the place i need
but you got me walking circles like a dog on a lead
and the doctors say i'm crazy, that i'm eight miles thick
i'm like the taste of macaroni on a seafood stick
and you got me switched on, baby, like electric eel
and i'm tight with axel foley, that's just how i feel
like a grapefruit and a magic trick, the prodigal son
i'm walking, i'm walking, i'm walking, i walk so quick

and it just don't mean a thing
we've been waiting far too long
we'll play it out again
this is just my serenade

you're in love with a psycho
you're in love with a psycho
and there's nothing you can do about it
i got you running all around it
you're in love with a psycho
you're in love with a psycho
and there's nothing you can do about it
you never gonna be without it

jibber jabber at the bargain booze
and reciting charles bukowski, i got nothing to lose
and i wait for you to follow me to share my chips
but you're walking, you're walking, you walk, you walk so quick

nobody's gonna take you there
i stick around for the thousand yard stare
i go to sleep in a duffle bag
i'm never up, never down, down, down, down

hey, you're in love with a psycho
you're in love with a psycho
and there's nothing you can do about it
i got you running all around it
you're in love with a psycho
you're in love with a psycho
and there's nothing you can do about it
you're never gonna be with  

maybe this way we'll find a solution
maybe this way we'll find a solution 

you're in love with a psycho
you're in love with a psycho
and there's nothing you can do about it
i got you running all around it
you're in love with a psycho
tu amor es muy loco
and there's nothing you can do about it
you never gonna be without it


we got style and we got grace
we run wild and never dance alone
in this town, she s fucking famous
but this town will never be her home
the sun sets on a promise kept
i try

but i don t need this modern love
this modern love
oh it always lets me down
 oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh 
this modern love
this modern love
oh it always lets me down
 oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh 

the popularity trap strikes again
you don t need these fools cause you re incroyable
 which is french for incredible 
we found solace at the star and garter
no malice, i can feel you coming alive
ignore the warning signs
and we try

but i don t need this modern love
this modern love
oh it always lets me down
 oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh 
this modern love
this modern love
oh it always lets me down
it lets me down

alright
a bare mattress, a lockless door
two withington hearts on a pique assiette floor
give me back those awkward exchanges
the fumbles in bathtubs
when we were just strangers
we talk about your graduation
and the realisation that we might not be together forever and ever, amen

wide eyed and up all night
this could be good
but i don't want to shy away
i hear them say, "romance is dead"
and i don't need this

modern love
this modern love
oh it always, it lets me down
 oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh 
oh, it lets me down
this modern love
this modern love
oh it always, it lets me down
it lets me down
it lets me down
it lets me down
alright
 oh oh oh oh oh,  oh oh oh oh oh 


i didn't see it coming  coming 
but i never really had much faith
in the universe's magic  magic , oh, no
till it pulled us to that time and place
and i'll never forget
when the floodgates opened, we, we cried an ocean
it still has me choking; it's hard to explain
i know you know me, you don't have to show me
i, i feel you're lonely, no need to explain

so don't say you love me; fala, "amo"
just let your heart speak up, and i'll know
no amount of words could ever find a way to make sense of this
so i wanna hear your mother tongue
so don't say you love me; fala, "amo"
just let your heart speak up, and i'll know
no amount of words could ever find a way to make sense of this
so i wanna hear your mother tongue

and yeah, i could be punching
but i always tend to fluctuate
and i feel sick that i'm buzzing, oh, love, i'm in trouble
i'm sorry, but you got me gushing all over the place
i never wanna get wet
but i think we're chosen like our fates were woven
and all of those bad choices were left turns on the way

so don't say you love me; fala, "amo"
just let your heart speak up, and i'll know
no amount of words could ever find a way to make sense of this
so i wanna hear your mother tongue
so don't say you love me; fala, "amo"
just let your heart speak up, and i'll know
no amount of words could ever find a way to make sense of this
so i wanna hear your mother tongue

i think best way to explain, it's like  oh oh, oh oh 
yeah, kinda like that, but a little more  oh oh, oh oh oh 
yeah, all makes sense, right? like  oh oh, oh oh 
like  oh oh, oh oh 
like  oh oh, oh oh oh 

so don't say you love me; fala, "amo"
just let your heart speak up, and i'll know
no amount of words could ever find a way to make sense of this
so i wanna hear your mother tongue
so don't say you love me; fala, "amo"
just let your heart speak up, and i'll know
no amount of words could ever find a way to make sense of this
so i wanna hear your mother tongue
so don't say you love me; fala, "amo"
just let your heart speak up, and i'll know
no amount of words could ever find a way to make sense of this
so i wanna hear your mother tongue


when i first met her she was seventeen
seventeen
jump like an arsonist to a perfect match
burned alive

we run 'til no one could find us
girl, we outrun everyone

but it doesn't matter now
just come and love me how
like the way you used to do
yeah

is love mental disease or lucky fever dream?
fine with either
gave birth to monsters who will terrorize normalcy, yeah
they'll terrorize

if the world exploded behind us
i never noticed if it done
let nobody dare confine us
i'll bury anyone who does

but it doesn't matter now
just come and love me how
like the way you used to do

now
the way you used to do

my heart, a ding a ling
a puppet on a string
c'est la vie
so lay your hands across my beating heart, love

if the world exploded behind us
i never noticed if it done
let nobody dare confine us
i'll bury anyone who does

but it doesn't matter now
just come and love me how
like the way you used to do

used to do
like the way you used to do
come and love me now
like the way you used to do
like the way you used to do


you might kill me with desire
wind me tighter than a wire
it's something that you do to me
i run away like mercury
and i know you think it's rough
when you're tryna patch us up
and i say, "honey, what is love?"
you just say i drink too much

maybe i'm defective
or maybe i'm dumb
i'm sorry, so sorry for what i've done
maybe i'm bad natured
or maybe i'm young
i'm sorry, so sorry for what i've done

and on the t shirt that i wear
pick the thorns out of my hair
i broke your heart so carelessly
but made the pieces part of me
and now it hurts what we've become
'cause you taught me how to love
it's me who taught you how to stop
and you just say i drink too much

maybe i'm defective
or maybe i'm dumb
i'm sorry, so sorry for what i've done
maybe i'm bad natured
or maybe i'm young
i'm sorry, so sorry for what i've done

i've waited for this
i'm ready for it
i've waited for this
i'm ready for it
i've been waiting so long
i've waited for this
i'm ready for it
i've waited for this
i'm ready for it
i've been waiting so long

maybe i'm defective
or maybe i'm dumb
i'm sorry, so sorry for what i've done
maybe i'm bad natured
or maybe i'm young
i'm sorry, so sorry for what i've done


i see a mountain at my gates
i see it more and more each day
what i give, it takes away
whether i go or when i stay

i see a mountain at my gates
i see it more and more each day
i see a fire out by the lake
i'll drive my car without the brakes

i see a mountain in my way
it's looming larger by the day
i see a darkness in my fate
i'll drive my car without the brakes

oh, gimme some time
show me the foothold from which i can climb
yeah, when i feel low
you show me a signpost for where i should go

i see a mountain at my gates
i see it more and more each day
and my desire wears a dark dress
but each day, i see you less

oh, gimme some time
show me the foothold from which i can climb
yeah, when i feel low
you show me a signpost for where i should go

through lanes and stone rows
black granite, wind blows
fire lake and far flame
go now but come again
dark clouds gather 'round
will i run or stand my ground?

oh, when i come to climb
show me the mountain so far behind
yeah, it's farther away
its shadow gets smaller day after day

yeah, gimme my way
gimme my love
gimme my choice
you keep me coming around
gimme my fate
gimme my lungs
gimme my voice
you keep me coming around
gimme my lungs
gimme my, gimme my, gimme my, gimme my
gimme my, gimme my, gimme my, gimme my, gimme my way
gimme my fate
gimme my lungs
gimme my choice
you keep me coming round

put your money on me
'cause i can barely breathe
put your money on me

put your money on me
if you think i'm losing you, you must be crazy
all your money on me
i'm never gonna let you go, even when it's easy
put your money on me
or tuck me into bed, and wake me when i'm dead
i know that you gotta be free
but i'm never gonna let it go

if there was a race, a race for your heart
it started before you were born
above the chloroform sky
clouds made of ambien
sitting on carpets in the basement of heaven
we were born innocent, but it lasts a day
and baby you can give all the money away
but if there's a race, a race for your heart
it's over before it starts
singing

put your money on me
if you think i'm losing you, you must be crazy
all your money on me

put your money on me
or tuck me into bed, and wake me when i'm dead
i know that you gotta be free
but i'm never gonna let it go

all my presents are broken before they're open
and the promises, the second they're spoken
i know i've been different
my skin keeps shedding
my mother was crying on the day of our wedding
trumpets of angels call for my head
i fight through the ether and i'll quit when i'm dead
if you want to know who'll be there in the end
when you bury me, baby, i'll still be your friend
singing

put your money on me
if you think i'm losing you, you must be crazy
all your money on me
i'm never gonna let you go, even when it's easy
put your money on me
or tuck me into bed, and wake me when i'm dead
i know that you gotta be free
but i'm never gonna let it go

singing put your money on
all your money on me
put your money on
i know it's not the last time
put your money on
all your money on
put your money on
i know it's not easy

 to put your money on me 
 'cause i can barely breathe 
 when you put your money on me 
when silicon valley's melted back into silicon
we'll find a way to survive
singing

put your money on me
if you think i'm losing you, you must be crazy
all your money on me
i'm never gonna let you go, even when it's easy
put your money on me

take a step outside your house
and have a look around, it's all the same to me
tiny places hold for you
many memories that only you describe

new, new, new, new
new, new, new, new

it's going to take a while to change
get used to the journeys home on stormy nights
weekends never far away
you two could always come and stay, it's all alright

new, new, new, new
new, new, new, new

and all this in different houses
we'll all get what we wish that we pray for
and all this in different houses

we'll all get
we'll all get
we'll all get
we'll all get

this is our last goodbye
i hate to feel the love between us die
but it's over
just hear this and then i'll go
you gave me more to live for
more than you'll ever know
this is our last embrace
must i dream and always see your face?
why can't we overcome this wall?
baby, maybe its just because i didn't know you at all
kiss me, please kiss me
but kiss me out of desire, babe, not consolation
oh, you know it makes me so angry
cause i know that in time, i'll only make you cry
this is our last goodbye ohhh
ohhh ohhh ohhh
did you say, "no, this can't happen to me"
did you rush to the phone to call
was there a voice unkind in the back of your mind
saying maybe you didn't know him at all
you didn't know him at all, oh oh, ya didn't know
ooo didn't know
well, the bells out in the church tower chime
burning clues into this heart of mine
thinking so hard on her soft eyes
and the memories, offer signs that it's over
over


make our escape
you're my own papillon
the world turns too fast
feel love before it's gone
it kicks like a sleep twitch
my papillon, feel love when it's shone

it kicks like a sleep twitch

darling
just don't put down your guns yet
if there really was a god here
he'd have raised a hand by now
now darling
you're born, get old and die here
well that's quite enough for me
we'll find our own way home somehow

no sense of doubt
or what you could achieve
well i've found you out
i've seen the life you wish to leave
but when it kicks like a sleep twitch
you will choke
choke on the air you try to breathe

it kicks like a sleep twitch

darling
now just don't put down your guns yet
if there really was a god here
he'd have raised a hand by now
darling
you're born, get old and die here
well that's quite enough for me, dear
we'll find our own way home somehow
how, how?

it kicks like a sleep twitch
it kicks like a sleep twitch

darling
just don't put down your guns yet
if there really was a god here
he'd have raised a hand by now
darling
oh, you're born, get old and die here
well that's quite enough for me, dear
we'll find our own way home somehow

it kicks like a sleep twitch

it kicks like a sleep twitch


every inch of sky's got a star
and every inch of skin's got a scar
i guess that you've got everything now
and every inch of space in your head
is filled up with the things that you read
i guess that you've got everything now
and every film that you've ever seen
fills the spaces up in your dreams
that reminds me
 everything now 
everything now  

every inch of road's got a sign
and every boy uses the same line
i pledge allegiance to everything now
and every song that i've ever heard
is playing at the same time, it's absurd
and it reminds me, we've got everything now
we turn the speakers up 'til they break
'cause every time you smile, it's a fake
stop pretending, you've got

 everything now   i need it
 everything now   i want it
 everything now   i can't live without
 everything now   i can't live without
 everything now 
everything now  
everything now

every inch of road's got a town
daddy, how come you're never around?
i miss you, like everything now
mama, leave the food on the stove
leave your car in the middle of the road
this happy family with everything now
we turn the speakers up 'til they break
'cause every time you smile, it's a fake
stop pretending, you've got

 everything now   i need it
 everything now   i want it
 everything now   i can't live without
 everything now   i can't live without
 everything now 
everything now  

'til every room in my house
is filled with shit i couldn't live without

 everything now   i need it
 everything now   i can't live without
 everything now 
everything now  
everything now

la, la, la, la, la, la la la
la, la, la, la, la la la
la, la, la, la, la la
la, la, la, la, la, la la la
la, la, la, la, la la la
la, la, la, la, la la
stop pretending, you've got

 everything now   i need it
 everything now   i want it
 everything now   i can't live without
 everything now   i can't live without
 everything now   i can't live
 everything now  

and every room in my house
is filled with shit i couldn't live without

 everything now   i need it
 everything now   i can't live without
 everything now   i can't live
 everything now  
every inch of space in my heart
is filled with something i'll never start

the ashes of everything now
and then you're black again
can't make it back again
from everything now


you were waiting for an answer
it was the hardest thing to hear
so strung out eclipsed by shivers
molleycoddled and sincere

it's a lonely life, a long and lonely life
stay with me and
be a ghost tonight, be a ghost tonight

but don't you be so cold

you were waiting for elation
like it would fall out of the sky
maybe time's the greatest healer
but baby everything will die

it's a lonely life, a long and lonely life
stay with me and
be a ghost tonight, be a ghost tonight

but don't you be so cold
don't you be so cold
don't you be so cold
don't you be so cold

it's a lonely life, a long and lonely life
stay with me and
be a ghost tonight, be a ghost tonight

but don't you be so cold
don't you be so cold
don't you be so cold
don't you be so cold
don't you be so cold
don't you be so cold
don't you be so cold

there's a time and place for everything, for everyone
we can push with all our might, but nothing's gonna come
oh no, nothing's gonna change
and if i asked you not to try
oh could you let it be
i wanna hold you and say
we can't throw this all away
tell me you won't go, you won't go
do you have to hear me say

i can't stop lovin' you
and no matter what you say or do
you know my heart is true, oh
i can't stop lovin' you
you can change your friends, your place in life
you can change your mind
we can change the things we say
and do it anytime
oh no, but i think you'll find
that when you look inside your heart
oh baby, i'll be there
hold on
i'm holding on
baby, just come on, come on, come on
i just wanna hear you say

oh, i'm twisted and tied
and all i can remember
is how hard we tried
only to surrender
and when it's over
i know how it's gonna be
and true love will never die
no, not fade away

and i know what i got to do
hey ray, what you said is true
i can't stop lovin' you, oh
oh, i can't stop lovin' you

i see forever when i look in your eyes
you're all i ever wanted
i always want you to be mine
let's make a promise till the end of time
we'll always be together
and our love will never die
so here we are face to face
and heart to heart
i want you to know we will
never be apart
now i believe that wishes can come true
'cause i see my whole world
i see only you
when i look into your eyes
i can see how much i love you
and it makes me realize
when i look into your eyes
i see all my dreams come true
when i look into your eyes
i've looked for you all of my life
now that i've found you
we will never say goodbye
i can't stop this feeling
and there's nothing i can do
'cause i see everything when i look at you
when i look into your eyes
i can see how much i love you
and it makes me realize
when i look into your eyes
i see all my dreams come true
when i look into your eyes
when i look into your eyes
i can see how much i love you
and it makes me realize
when i look into your eyes
we will always be together
and our love will never die
when i look into your eyes
i see that only dreams come true
when i look into your eyes
when i look into your eyes

should have told you by now, but i can't find the words, oh no
if i could show you somehow, but i don't have the nerve, oh yeah
you don't see me looking at you, how can love be so blind
somehow you don't notice me, sooner or later there will come a time, baby
if you needed somebody, the way that i need you
if you wanted somebody, the way that i want you
oh yeah, the way that i want you
if i could hold you tonight, it would last me forever
but the time's never right, when will we be together, oh no
if i could make you understand, what you're doing to me
maybe there will come a time, when sooner or later i will make you see, baby
if you needed somebody, the way that i need you
if you wanted somebody, the way that i want you
ooh, if i could tell you now, the way you make me feel
ooh, if i could show you somehow, don't you know my lovin' is oh so real
if you needed somebody, the way that i need you
if you wanted somebody, the way that i want you
 if you needed somebody  i need you, i want you, i gotta tell you
the way that i need you
and if you wanted somebody, the way that i want you...

lay where you're laying
don't make a sound
i know they're watching
watching
all the commotion
the kiddie like play
it has people talking
talking

you 
your sex is on fire

the dark of the alley
the breaking of day
head while i'm driving
i'm driving
soft lips are open
them knuckles are pale
feels like you're dying
you're dying

you 
your sex is on fire
consumed 
with what's just transpired

hot as a fever
rattle of bones
i could just taste it
taste it
but it's not forever
but it's just tonight
oh we're still the greatest
the greatest, the greatest

you 
your sex is on fire
you 
your sex is on fire, ahh
consumed 
with what's to transpire
and you 
your sex is on fire
consumed 
with what's to transpire


many nights we've prayed
with no proof anyone could hear
in our hearts a hopeful song
we barely understood
now, we are not afraid
although we know there's much to fear
we were moving mountains
long before we knew we could

there can be miracles when you believe
though hope is frail, it's hard to kill
who knows what miracles you can achieve?
when you believe, somehow you will
you will when you believe

in this time of fear
when prayer so often proves in vain
hope seems like the summer birds
too swiftly flown away
yet now i'm standing here
my heart's so full, i can't explain
seeking faith and speaking words
i never thought i'd say

there can be miracles when you believe
though hope is frail, it's hard to kill
who knows what miracles you can achieve?
when you believe, somehow you will
you will when you    believe

they don't always happen when you ask
and it's easy to give in to your fears
but when you're blinded by your pain
can't see your way clear through the rain
a small but still resilient voice says, "help is very near "

there can be miracles when you believe
though hope is frail, it's hard to kill
who knows what miracles you can achieve?
when you believe, somehow you will
now, you will, you will when you believe
you will when you believe, just believe
just believe, you will when you believe


i could stay awake just to hear you breathin'
watch you smile while you are sleeping
while you're far away and dreaming
i could spend my life in this sweet surrender
i could stay lost in this moment forever
where every moment spent with you is a moment i treasure

don't want to close my eyes
i don't want to fall asleep
'cause i'd miss you, baby

you could be my unintended choice
to live my life extended

pieces of the life i had before

i cry for you, you were the song in my life

harrowed the light i could face the bulb
i'm on a tide like a perished boat
and i'd keep you mine in a phasing tone
carrying my lies like an aeolus son
i wanted time, i could've faired the rope
keeping alive all the parables
i want to have all what's left to go
saving a life i can't bare to show
don't rely on me
if i put a fight i could save the show
it's over now you can take your stuff
i want to have all what's left to go
keeping the lies on the fair, the low
don't rely on me
i've been told to cause no trouble
i've been told
"too caught in time"
i've been told: don't fight
i feel numb, numb, fine
i'd been told
don't rely on me


so if you're lonely, you know i'm here waiting for you
i'm just a crosshair, i'm just a shot away from you
and if you leave here, you leave me broken, shattered i lie
i'm just a crosshair, i'm just a shot, then we can die

i know i won't be leaving here with you

i say, don't you know? you say you don't know
i say: take me out
i say, you don't show, don't move, time is slow
i say: take me out
well, i say, you don't know, you say you don't know
i say: take me out
if i move, this could die, if eyes move, this could die
i want you to take me out

i know i won't be leaving here  with you 
i know i won't be leaving here  with you 
i know i won't be leaving here  with you 
i know i won't be leaving here with you

i say, don't you know? you say you don't know
i say: take me out
if i wane, this could die, i wait this, could die
i want you to take me out
if i move, this could die, eyes move, this can die
come on, take me out

i know i won't be leaving here  with you 
i know i won't be leaving here  with you 
i know i won't be leaving here  with you 
i know i won't be leaving here with you

such a shame to believe in escape
a life on every face
and that's a change
'til i'm finally left with an eight
tell me to relax, i just stare
maybe i don't know if i should change
a feeling that we share
it's a shame

 such a shame 
number me with rage, it's a shame
 such a shame 
number me in haste  such a shame 
this eagerness to change
it's a shame

the dice decide my fate
and that's a shame
in these trembling hands
my faith tells me to react, i don't care
maybe it's unkind that i should change
a feeling that we share
it's a shame

 such a shame 
number me with rage, it's a shame
 such a shame

don't get me wrong
if i'm looking kind of dazzled
i see neon lights
whenever you walk by
don't get me wrong
if you say hello and i take a ride
upon a sea where the mystic moon
is playing havoc with the tide
don't get me wrong
don't get me wrong
if i'm acting so distracted
i'm thinking about the fireworks
that go off when you smile
don't get me wrong
if i split like light refracted
i'm only off to wander
across a moonlit mile
once in a while, two people meet
seemingly for no reason, they just pass on the street
suddenly, thunder showers everywhere
who can explain the thunder and rain?
but there's something in the air
don't get me wrong
if i come and go like fashion
i might be great tomorrow
but hopeless yesterday
don't get me wrong
if i fall in the mode of fashion
it might be unbelievable
but let's not say so long
it might just be fantastic
don't get me wrong


in the dark, in the dark

ooh, i've done it again
dug a little deep and it's all caved in
now, i free fall in a black hole
i know i'm getting warm 'cause i feel so cold

but i'm looking on the bright side now
tryna figure out somehow
 none of this is real, no 
it's looking like a write off now
i think we need to talk like now

so don't swear to god, he never asked you
it's not his heart you drove a knife through
it's not his world you turned inside out
not his tears still rolling down
jesus christ, you're so damn cold
don't you know you've lost control?
forget about the things you think i know
no secrets, you can't keep me
in the dark, in the dark

deathblow, look at you go
brought a t 62 to a rodeo
so tall, it broke the fourth wall

tryna figure out somehow
 none of this is real, no 
you can give the act up now
yeah, go ahead and take a bow

so don't swear to god, he never asked you
it's not his heart you drove a knife through

i'm not looking for salvation
just a little faith in anyone or anything
i'm not looking for salvation
just a little faith in anyone or anything
i'm not looking for salvation  oh no, 'cause it's all come caving in 
just a little faith in anyone or anything
i'm not looking for salvation
just a little faith in anyone or anything
and it's time i knew you, so

don't swear to god, he never asked you  oh no 
it's not his heart you drove a knife through  oh no 
it's not his world you turned inside out  inside out

you've gone too far this time
but i'm dancing on the valentine
i tell you somebody's fooling around
with my chances on the danger line
i'll cross that bridge when i find it
another day to make my stand, oh woah
high time is no time for deciding
if i should find a helping hand, oh woah
why don't you use it?
try not to bruise it
buy time, don't lose it
oh, why don't you use it?
try not to bruise it
buy time, don't lose it
the reflex is a lonely child, who's waiting by the park
the reflex is in charge of finding treasure in the dark
and watching over lucky clover, isn't that bizarre?
and every little thing the reflex does
leaves you answered with a question mark
i'm on a ride and i want to get off
but they won't slow down the roundabout
i sold the renoir and tv set
don't wanna be around when this gets out
so, why don't you use it?
try not to bruise it
buy time, don't lose it
why don't you use it?
the reflex is a lonely child, he's waiting in the park
the reflex is in charge of finding treasure in the dark
and watching over lucky clover, isn't that bizarre?
and every little thing the reflex does
leaves an answer with a question mark, play
so, why don't you use it?
try not to bruise it
buy time, don't lose it
the reflex is a lonely child who's waiting by the park
the reflex is in charge of finding treasure in the dark
and watching over lucky clover, isn't that bizarre?
and every little thing the reflex does
leaves me answered with a question mark
oh, the reflex, what a game, he's hiding all the cards
the reflex is in charge of finding treasure in the dark

 outro 

everybody's talking at me
i don't hear a word they're saying
only the echoes of my mind
people stopping, staring
i can't see their faces
only the shadows of their eyes
i'm going where the sun keeps shining
through the pouring rain
going where the weather suits my clothes
banking off of the northeast winds
sailing on a summer breeze
and skipping over the ocean like a stone
wah, wah wah wah wah
wah wah wah wah, wah wah wah
wahhh
i'm going where the sun keeps shining

in time i want to be your best friend
east side love is living on the west end
knocked out, but boy, you better come to
don't die, you know, the truth as some do
go write your message on the pavement
burnin' so bright, i wonder what the wave meant
white heat is screamin' in the jungle
complete the motion if you stumble
go ask the dust for any answers
come back strong with fifty belly dancers

the world i love, the tears i drop
to be part of the wave, can't stop
ever wonder if it's all for you?
the world i love, the trains i hop

the gender of a generation
the birth of every other nation
worth your weight, the gold of meditation
this chapter's gonna be a close one
smoke rings, i know you're gonna blow one
all on a spaceship, persevering
use my hands for everything but steering
can't stop the spirits when they need you
mop tops are happy when they feed you
j. butterfly is in the treetop
birds that blow the meaning into bebop

wait a minute, i'm passin' out win or lose, just like you
far more shockin' than anything i ever knew, how about you?
ten more reasons why i need somebody new, just like you
far more shockin' than anything i ever knew, right on cue

can't stop, addicted to the shindig
chop top, he says i'm gonna win big
choose not a life of imitation
distant cousin to the reservation
defunct, the pistol that you pay for
this punk, the feelin' that you stay for
in time i want to be your best friend
east side love is living on the west end
knocked out, but boy, you better come to
don't die, you know, the truth is some do

burnin' so bright, i wonder what the wave meant
kick start the golden generator
sweet talk but don't intimidate her
can't stop the gods from engineering
feel no need for any interfering
your image in the dictionary
this life is more than ordinary

comin' from the space to teach you of the pleiades
can't stop the spirits when they need you
this life is more than just a read through

i thought love was only true in fairy tales
meant for someone else but not for me
love was out to get me

disappointment haunted all my dreams

i couldn't leave her if i tried

i thought love was more or less a givin' thing
seems the more i gave the less i got

hey, where did we go?
days when the rains came
down in the hollow
playin' a new game
laughing and a running hey, hey
skipping and a jumping
in the misty morning fog with
our hearts a thumpin' and you
my brown eyed girl
you, my brown eyed girl

whatever happened
to tuesday and so slow?
going down the old mine
with a transistor radio
standing in the sunlight laughing
hiding behind a rainbow's wall
slipping and sliding
all along the waterfall, with you
my brown eyed girl
you, my brown eyed girl

do you remember when we used to sing
sha la la la la la la la la la la te da
just like that
sha la la la la la la la la la la te da la te da

so hard to find my way
now that i'm all on my own
i saw you just the other day
my, how you have grown
cast my memory back there, lord
sometimes i'm overcome thinking 'bout
making love in the green grass
behind the stadium with you
my brown eyed girl
you, my brown eyed girl

do you remember when we used to sing
sha la la la la la la la la la la te da
sha la la la la la la la la la la te da la te da

i ain't nothing but tired

hey there baby, i could use just a little help

you can't start a fire without a spark
this gun's for hire
even if we're just dancing in the dark

message keeps getting clearer
radio's on and i'm moving 'round the place
i check my look in the mirror
i wanna change my clothes, my hair, my face
man, i ain't getting nowhere
i'm just living in a dump like this
there's something happening somewhere
baby, i just know that there is

you can't start a fire
you can't start a fire without a spark
this gun's for hire
even if we're just dancing in the dark

you sit around getting older
there's a joke here somewhere and it's on me
i'll shake this world off my shoulders
come on, baby, the laugh's on me

stay on the streets of this town
and they'll be carving you up all right
they say you gotta stay hungry
hey, baby, i'm just about starving tonight
i'm dying for some action
i'm sick of sitting 'round here trying to write this book
i need a love reaction
come on now, baby, gimme just one look

you can't start a fire
sitting 'round crying over a broken heart
this gun's for hire
even if we're just dancing in the dark
you can't start a fire
worrying about your little world falling apart
this gun's for hire
even if we're just dancing in the dark

even if we're just dancing in the dark

i'm sure you've heard it all before but you never really had a doubt

and all the lights that lead us there are blinding

you're gonna be the one that saves me
and after all
you're my wonderwall

i felt i was invincible, you wrapped around my head
now different lives i lead, my body lives on lead
the last two lines may read incorrect until said
the lead is terrible in flavor
but now you double as a paper maker
i despise you sometimes, i love to hate the fight
and you in my life is like

i've been tested like the ends of
a weathered flag that's by the sea
can you build my house with pieces?
i'm just a chemical
can you build my house with pieces?
i'm just a chemical
can you build my house with pieces?

i just wanna stay in the sun where i find
i know it's hard sometimes
pieces of peace in the sun's peace of mind
i know it's hard sometimes
yeah i think about the end just way too much
but it's fun to fantasize
on my enemies i wouldn't wish who i was
but it's fun to fantasize  size, size 

oh oh ohhh, oh oh ohhh, i'm falling
so i'm taking my time on my ride
oh oh ohhh, i'm falling

taking my time on my ride

"i'd die for you," that's easy to say
we have a list of people that we would take
a bullet for them, a bullet for you
a bullet for everybody in this room
but i don't seem to see many bullets coming through
see many bullets coming through
metaphorically, i'm the man
but literally, i don't know what i'd do
"i'd live for you," and that's hard to do
even harder to say when you know it's not true
even harder to write when you know that tonight
there were people back home who tried talking to you
but then you ignore them still
all these questions they re for real
like who would you live for? who would you die for?
and would you ever kill?

'cause i'm telling you she knows where it's at"

and everybody started to run

and then she was a holding my right

'cause you're gonna be spared"
well i've gotta be forgiven

with a long cool woman in a black dress
just a 5'9" beautiful tall

it's nine o'clock on a saturday
the regular crowd shuffles in
there's an old man sitting next to me
making love to his tonic and gin
he says, "son, can you play me a memory?
i'm not really sure how it goes
but it's sad and it's sweet and i knew it complete
when i wore a younger man's clothes."

la la la, di da da
la la, di da da da dum

sing us a song, you're the piano man
sing us a song tonight
well, we're all in the mood for a melody
and you've got us feeling alright

now john at the bar is a friend of mine
he gets me my drinks for free
and he's quick with a joke or to light up your smoke
but there's someplace that he'd rather be
he says, "bill, i believe this is killing me."
as the smile ran away from his face
"well i'm sure that i could be a movie star
if i could get out of this place"

la la la, di da da
la la, di da da da dum

now paul is a real estate novelist
who never had time for a wife
and he's talkin' with davy, who's still in the navy
and probably will be for life
and the waitress is practicing politics
as the businessmen slowly get stoned
yes, they're sharing a drink they call loneliness
but it's better than drinkin' alone

sing us a song, you're the piano man
sing us a song tonight
well, we're all in the mood for a melody
and you've got us feeling alright

it's a pretty good crowd for a saturday
and the manager gives me a smile
 cause he knows that it's me they've been comin' to see
to forget about life for a while
and the piano, it sounds like a carnival
and the microphone smells like a beer
and they sit at the bar and put bread in my jar
and say, "man, what are you doin' here?"

la la la, di da da
la la, di da da da dum

sing us a song, you're the piano man
sing us a song tonight
well, we're all in the mood for a melody
and you've got us feeling alright

silver rings and magic things
your children should not know
evil deeds are rotten seeds
the kind that never grow
you put them in the ground you know
what you will become
mmm mmm, i'll tell you son
she traded life for happiness
with no regrets at all
it left a rotten emptiness
it left her feeling small
it left her nothing there at all
except something she despised
mmm mmm, you see it in her eyes
she fell in love with lies
mmm mmm, she's not a sinner
she traded love for liberty
a bold pursuit of fun
she gave away her sanity
and found that she had none
watch quickly now as she becomes
the thing that she despised
mmm mm, feel it in her
she's living in the lie, mmm mmm
and she's the center
she gave away her life
mmm mmm, she's not a sinner


i wish i found some better sounds no one's ever heard
i wish i had a better voice that sang some better words
i wish i found some chords in an order that is new
i wish i didn't have to rhyme every time i sang
i was told, when i get older, all my fears would shrink
but now i'm insecure, and i care what people think

my name's blurryface and i care what you think
my name's blurryface and i care what you think

wish we could turn back time to the good old days
when our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out
wish we could turn back time to the good old days
when our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out
we're stressed out

sometimes a certain smell will take me back to when i was young
how come i'm never able to identify where it's coming from?
i'd make a candle out of it, if i ever found it
try to sell it, never sell out of it, i'd probably only sell one
it'd be to my brother, 'cause we have the same nose
same clothes, home grown, a stone's throw from a creek we used to roam
but it would remind us of when nothing really mattered
out of student loans and tree house homes, we all would take the latter

my name's blurryface and i care what you think
my name's blurryface and i care what you think

wish we could turn back time to the good old days
when our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out
wish we could turn back time to the good old days
when our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out

used to play pretend, give each other different names
we would build a rocket ship and then we'd fly it far away
used to dream of outer space, but now they're laughin' at our face
sayin', "wake up, you need to make money ", yeah
used to play pretend, give each other different names

we used to play pretend, used to play pretend, bunny
we used to play pretend, wake up you need the money

and the lamb lies down on broadway
early morning manhattan
ocean winds blow on the land
the movie palace is now undone
the all night watchmen have had their fun
sleeping cheaply on the midnight show
it's the same old ending   time to go
get out 
it seems they cannot leave their dream
there's something moving in the sidewalk steam
and the lamb lies down on broadway
nightime's flyers feel their pains
drugstore takes down the chains
metal motion comes in bursts
but the gas station can quench that thirst
suspension cracked on unmade road
the trucker's eyes read 'overload'
and out on the subway
rael imperial aerosol kid
exits into daylight, spraygun hid
and the lamb lies down on broadway
the lamb seems right out of place
yet the broadway street scene finds a focus in its face
somehow it's lying there
brings a stillness to the air
though man made light, at night is very bright
there's no whitewash victim
as the neons dim, to the coat of white
rael imperial aerosol kid
wipes his gun he's forgotten what he did
and the lamb lies down on broadway
suzanne tired her work all done
thinks money honey be on neon
cabman's velvet glove sounds the horn
and the sawdust king spits out his scorn
wonder women draw your blind 
don't look at me  i'm not your kind
i'm rael 
something inside me has just begun
lord knows what i have done
and the lamb lies down on broadway
on broadway
they say the lights are always bright on broadway
they say there's always magic in the air

and you know i give myself to you

i've built my world around you and i want you to know
i need you, like i've never needed anyone before
i live my life for you
i want to be by your side in everything that you do
and if there's only one thing you can believe is true
i live my life for you
i dedicated my life to you
you know that i would die for you
but our love would last forever
and i will always be with you
and there is nothing we can't do
as long as we're together
i just can't live without you, and i want you to know
i need you like i've never needed anyone before
i live my life for you
i want to be by your side in everything that you do
and if there's only one thing you can believe is true
i live my life for you
i've built my world around you and i want you to know
i need you, like i've never needed anyone before
wow, yeah i live my life for you

i know that she's waitin'
for me to say forever
i know that i sometimes
just don't know how to tell her
i want to hold and kiss her
give her my love, make her believe
she doesn't know
she doesn't know
you're all i need beside me girl
you're all i need to turn my world
you're all i want inside my heart
you're all i need when we're apart
you're all that i need   yeah
i know that she's always
there when i need her loving
i know that i never
told her how much i love her
i see her face before me
i look in her eyes
just wondering why
she doesn't know
she doesn't know
she doesn't know
you're all i need beside me girl
you're all i need to turn my world
you're all i want inside my heart
you're all i need when we're apart
say, say that you'll be there
whenever i reach out to feel your hand in mine
stay, stay within my heart
whenever i'm alone, i know that you are there
oooooh
 2 times 
you're all i need beside me girl
you're all i need to turn my world
you're all i want inside my heart
you're all i need when we're apart
all that i need is for you to believe
all that i need is you

how can i convince you, what you see is real
who am i to blame you for doubting what you feel
i was always reachin', you were just a girl i knew
i took for granted the friend i have in you
i was living for a dream, loving for a moment
taking on the world, that was just my style
now i look into your eyes, i can see forever
the search is over, you were with me all the while
can we last forever, do we fall apart
at times it's so confusing, the questions of the heart
you followed me through changes and patiently you'd wait
till i came to my senses through some miracle of fate
i was living for a dream, loving for a moment
taking on the world, that was just my style
now i look into your eyes, i can see forever
the search is over, you were with me all the while
now the miles stretch out behind me
loves that i have lost
broken hearts lie victims of the game
then good luck it finally struck
like lightnin' from the blue
every highway is leadin' me back to you
now at last i hold you, now all is said and done
the search has come full circle, our destinies are one
so if you ever loved me, show me that you give a damn
you'll know for certain, the man i really am
i was living for a dream, loving for a moment
taking on the world, that was just my style
then i touched your hand, i could hear you whisper
the search is over, love was right before my eyes


i cut off my head and my cheetah tongue
i can't think straight and my mouth is numb
don't shut your eyes till we fade to black
cause maybe this time the good stuff could last

you won me over
my orange cola got black flamingos crying for ya
well i'll see you later
i could be your faker
my hands shake like jellyfish when you're near

i cut off my head and my cheetah tongue
i can't think straight and my mouth is numb
don't shut your eyes till we fade to black
cause maybe this time the good stuff could last

you're a hammer, sweet firecracker
stumbling through chinatown
liar, liar, my house is on fire
somewhere between chinatown and here

i cut off my head and my cheetah tongue
i can't think straight and my mouth is numb
don't shut your eyes till we fade to black
cause maybe this time the good stuff could last

come a little closer, it's alright
i'll be your character with flaws tonight
come a little closer, my firefly
you're not the only one who doesn't want to be alone tonight

i cut off my head and my cheetah tongue
i can't think straight and my mouth is numb
don't shut your eyes till we fade to black
cause maybe this time the good stuff could last

yeah 
don t look back into the sun
now you know that the time is come
and they said it would never come for you oh oh oh oh
oh my friend you haven t changed
you're looking rough and living strange
and i know you got a taste for it too oh oh oh
they'll never forgive you but they won't let you go  oh no 
she'll never forgive you but she won't let you go, oh no 
don't look back into the sun
you've cast your pearls but you're on the run
and all the lies you said, who did you save?
but when they played that song at the death disco
it started fast but it ends so slow
and all the time just reminded me of you
they'll never forgive you but they won't let you go  let me go  
she'll never forgive you but she won't let you go, oh no 


you would keep the secrets in ya'
you've been keeping paraphernalia, oh
i think you know
anyone can walk up to ya'
anyone can see right through your eyes
all night

and i don't mean to be unkind
but i see what's in your mind
and the stone you throw
will turn back in its path
one day you'll shatter like a wall of glass
wall of glass
wall of glass
one day you'll shatter like a wall of glass

you believe in fascinations
and designer vaccinations, love
you get along
you were sold a one direction
i believe the resurrection's on
and you were wrong

and i don't mean to be unkind
but i see what's in your mind
and the stone you throw
will turn back in its path
one day you'll shatter like a wall of glass
wall of glass
wall of glass
one day you'll shatter like a wall of glass

and i don't mean to be unkind
but i see what's in your mind
and the stone you throw
will turn back in its path
one day you'll shatter like a wall of glass
wall of glass
wall of glass
one day you'll shatter like a wall of glass


stop making the eyes at me, i'll stop making the eyes at you
what it is that surprises me is that i don't really want you to

and your shoulders are frozen  cold as the night 
oh, but you're an explosion  you're dynamite 
your name isn't rio, but i don't care for sand
and lighting the fuse might result in a bang, b b bang oh

i bet that you look good on the dancefloor
i don't know if you're looking for romance or
i don't know what you're looking for
i said, i bet that you look good on the dancefloor
dancing to electro pop like a robot from 1984
well, from 1984

i wish you'd stop ignoring me because it's sending me to despair
without a sound, yeah, you're calling me and i don't think it's very fair

that your shoulders are frozen  cold as the night 
oh, but you're an explosion  you're dynamite 
your name isn't rio, but i don't care for sand
and lighting the fuse might result in a bang, b b bang oh

i bet that you look good on the dancefloor

i don't know what you're looking for
i said, i bet that you look good on the dancefloor
dancing to electro pop like a robot from 1984
well, from 1984

and no there in't no love, no montagues or capulets
just banging tunes and dj sets and
dirty dancefloors and dreams of naughtiness

well i bet that you look good on the dancefloor
i don't know if you're looking for romance or
i don't know what you're looking for
i said, i bet that you look good on the dancefloor
dancing to electro pop like a robot from 1984
said, from 1984

do you have the time to listen to me whine?
about nothing and everything all at once
i am one of those
melodramatic fools
neurotic to the bone
no doubt about it

sometimes i give myself the creeps
sometimes my mind plays tricks on me
it all keeps adding up
i think i'm cracking up
am i just paranoid?
or am i just stoned?

i went to a shrink
to analyze my dreams
she says it's lack of sex that's bringing me down
i went to a whore
he said my life's a bore
so quit my whining 'cause it's bringing her down

sometimes i give myself the creeps
sometimes my mind plays tricks on me
it all keeps adding up
i think i'm cracking up
am i just paranoid?
i'm just stoned

grasping to control
so i better hold on

sometimes i give myself the creeps
sometimes my mind plays tricks on me
it all keeps adding up
i think i'm cracking up
am i just paranoid?
i'm just stoned


god money, i'll do anything for you

bow down before the one you serve
you're going to get what you deserve
bow down before the one you serve
you're going to get what you deserve

god money's not looking for the cure
god money's not concerned about the sick among the pure
god money, let's go dancing on the backs of the bruised

i'd say it was the right time
to walk away
when dreaming takes you nowhere
it's time to play
bodies working overtime
your money don't matter
the time keeps ticking
when someone's on your mind
on your mind
i'm moving in slow motion
feels so good
it's a strange anticipation
knock, knock
knocking on wood
bodies working overtime
it's man against man
and all that ever matters is, baby
who's ahead in the game
funny
but it's always the same

playing
playing with the boys
staying
playing with the boys
after chasing sunsets
one of life's simple joys
is playing with the boys

said it was the wrong thing
for me to do
i said it's just a boys' game
but girls play too
my heart is working overtime
in this kind of game
people get hurt
i'm thinking that the people is me
if you wanna find me
i'll be

playing
playing with the boys
staying
playing with the boys
after chasing sunsets
one of life's simple joys
 is the boys 

i don't wanna be
the moth around your fire
 with the boys 
i don't wanna be
obsessed by my desire
 you're shining, you're smiling, i'll see it now 
with the boys
 i'm staying here 
you play too rough

playing
playing with the boys
i'll be staying
playing with the boys
after chasing sunsets
one of life's simple joys
is playing with the boys
playing with the boys
playing
 playing with the boys 
playing
 playing with the boys 
get up, get up
playing
 playing with the boys 
get up, get up

arabella's got some interstellar gator skin boots
an' a helter skelter 'round her little finger
an' i ride it endlessly
she's got a barbarella silver swimsuit
an' when she needs to shelter from reality
she takes a dip in my daydreams

my days end best when the sunset gets itself behind
that little lady sittin' on the passenger side
it's much less picturesque without her catchin' the light
the horizon tries but it's just not as kind on the eyes
as arabella, oh
as arabella

just might ve tapped into your mind and soul
you can't be sure

arabella's got a '70s head
but she's a modern lover
it's an exploration, she's made of outer space
an' her lips are like the galaxy's edge
an' her kiss the colour of a constellation
fallin' into place

my days end best when the sunset gets itself behind
that little lady sittin' on the passenger side
it's much less picturesque without her catchin' the light
the horizon tries but it's just not as kind on the eyes
as arabella, oh
as arabella

 that's magic  in a cheetah print coat
 just a slip  underneath it, i hope
 asking if  i can have one of those
 organic  cigarettes that she smokes
 wraps her lips  'round a mexican coke
 makes you wish  that you were the bottle
 takes a sip  of your soul, an' it sounds like


just might ve tapped into your mind and soul
you can't be sure


come away, from the window
there's nothing for you there
there s nothing for you there
frost is growing, on the glass
where you left your face
pick it up and we can change

under the sun
i'm calling
where you belong
you're crawling
back to my arms
in dreams i make believe
please don t be long
you know i don't believe

lucy
oh oh
lucy
oh oh

come away, from the window
haven't you learnt?
that in dreams you can't get burned
and i will meet you there
under purest skies
it's where i'll be
when they're finished with me

under the sun
i'm calling
where you belong
you re crawling
back to my arms
in dreams i make believe
please don t be long
you know i don't believe

lucy

in the dream i can see your face
in reality, you re always two steps away

lucy

know my only goal is to see
when i'm only fast asleep
it takes more than strength to find
this piece of mind

so i'll hold, hold, hold
hold it close to my heart beating
with every step
hold, hold, hold it close

he sleeps alone
he needs no army where he's headed cause he knows
that they're just ghosts
and they can't hurt him if he can't see them, ohh
and i may go
to places i have never been to just to find
the deepest desires in my mind

we, we only know what we see
cause we're always fast asleep
is it so hard not to believe?
that we'll never know

oh, hold hold hold
hold me close
i've never been this far from home
hold hold hold me close

he sleeps alone
he needs no army where he's headed cause he knows
that they're just ghosts
and they can't hurt him if he can't see them, ohh
and i may go
to places i have never been to just to find
the deepest desires in my mind

it's in my head and i have said
that i must be like him now
he sleeps alone, he sleeps alone
and one last chance to make sense
of what is long escaped ours
he sleeps alone, i sleep alone

he sleeps alone
he needs no army where he's headed cause he knows
that they're just ghosts
and they can't hurt him if he can't see them, ohh
and i don't know
if in the morning i will be here and it's old
but if he'd known
that i was worthy, i was worthy
i was worthy, i was

ohh  oh oh oh  oh oh oh  ohh 
ohh  oh oh oh  oh oh oh  ohh 


village waiting
nice and easy, gently does it now
but rest is never allowed
'cause the king's men, they wanna know
how much gold's enough to reach god
but god won't speak till the land is dead
so capital is on our heads

don't wake hatsune
she fell asleep and she dreams of war
miku sleep with you

and as the day turns over
when in our evening slumber
in a half lit squander
we'll stay inside
because we're torn and dumb
kept warm in little smart houses  houses 
little smart houses  houses 

pleasant forest
long forgotten, distant memories
herbal tea remedies
are ridiculous, only believe
in what the human eye can see
but free yourself and you will conceive
a life beyond your wildest dreams

people flee to stars
far away stars

and as the day turns over
when in our evening slumber
in a half lit squander
we'll stay inside
because we're torn and dumb
kept warm in little smart houses  houses 
little smart houses  houses 
in little smart houses  houses 
little smart houses  houses 


and as the day turns over
when in our evening slumber
in a half lit squander
we'll stay inside
because we're torn and dumb
kept warm in little smart houses  houses 
little smart houses  houses 
in little smart houses  houses 
little smart houses  houses 


jesus, don't cry
you can rely on me honey
you can combine anything you want
i'll be around
you were right about the stars
each one is a setting sun

tall buildings shake
voices escape singing sad sad songs
tuned to chords strung down your cheeks
bitter melodies turning your orbit around

don't cry
you can rely on me honey
you can come by any time you want
i'll be around
you were right about the stars
each one is a setting sun

tall buildings shake
voices escape singing sad sad songs
tuned to chords strung down your cheeks
bitter melodies turning your orbit around

voices whine
skyscrapers are scraping together
your voice is smoking
last cigarettes are all you can get
turning your orbit around

our love
our love
our love is all we have
our love
our love is all of god's money
everyone is a burning sun

tall buildings shake
voices escape singing sad sad songs
tuned to chords strung down your cheeks
bitter melodies turning your orbit around

voices whine
skyscrapers are scraping together
your voice is smoking
last cigarettes are all you can get
turning your orbit around

last cigarettes are all you can get
turning your orbit around
last cigarettes are all you can get
turning your orbit around

well, i took a stroll on the old long walk
of a day i ay i ay
i met a little girl and we stopped to talk
of a fine soft day i ay
and i ask you, friend, what's a fella to do
because her hair was black and her eyes were blue
and i knew right then i'd be taking a whirl
around the salthill prom with a galway girl
we were halfway there when the rain came down
of a day i ay i ay
and she asked me up to her flat down town
of a fine soft day i ay
and i ask you, friend, what's a fella to do
because her hair was black and her eyes were blue
so i took her hand and i gave her a twirl
and i lost my heart to a galway girl
when i woke up i was all alone
with a broken heart and a ticket home
and i ask you now, tell me what would you do
if her hair was black and her eyes were blue
'cause i've traveled around, i've been all over this world
boys i ain't never seen nothing like a galway girl


i watched you walk away
hopeless, with nothing to say
i strain my eyes
hoping to see you again

this is my curse  the longing 
this is my curse  time 
this is my curse  the yearning 
this is my curse
there is love burning to find you
will you wait for me?
will you be there?

your silence haunts me
but still i hunger for you

this is my curse  the wanting 
this is my curse  time 
this is my curse  the needing 
this is my curse
there is love burning to find you
will you wait for me?

and still i want
and still i ache
but still i wait

to see you again
dying, inside, these walls
dying, inside, these walls
and i see your face in these tears
in these tears
and i see your face

there is love
there is love
there is love
there is love
there is love
there is love
there is love
there is love

blank face in the windowpane
made clear in seconds of light
disappears and returns again
counting hours, searching the night
might be waiting for someone
might be there for us to see
might be in need of talking
might be staring directly at me
inside plays a lullaby
slurred voice over children cry
on the inside
haunting loneliness in the eye
skin covering a secret scar
his hand is waving a goodbye
there's no response or action returned
there is deep prejudice in me
outshines all reason inside
given dreams all ridden with pain
and projected unto the last


life in a world untold, question the unknown
this prison captures me, my cell is all i know
i thought i knew it all, stubborn in my ways
my sentence has begun, my future's what i waste

next chapter of my life is filled with violent scenes
i stay awake at night hiding from my dreams
the voices haunting me, driving me insane
can't seem to get away, they're calling out my name
i feel i am slipping
are they out to get me?
my life is upside down
more than meets the eye

for now, i am in control, choosing my own fate
and now i sleep at night because i'm not afraid
the demons haunting me, i chased them all away
i've conquered all my fears, my destiny awaits
i'm no longer slipping
 i'm not slipping away 
no one is out to get me
 no one will get in my way 
no longer upside down
 i've turned my life around 
more than meets the eye
more than...
more than...
more than...
more than meets the eye

i, i can't get these memories out of my mind
and some kind of madness has started to evolve, mmm
and i, i tried so hard to let you go
but some kind of madness is swallowing me whole, yeah

i have finally seen the light
and i have finally realized what you mean

and now i need to know   is this real love
or is it just madness keeping us afloat? mmm
and when i look back at all the crazy fights we've had
like some kind of madness was taking control, yeah

and now i have finally seen the light
and i have finally realized what you need

but now i have finally seen the end
 finally seen the end 
and i'm not expecting you to care, no
 expecting you to care 
that i have finally seen the light
 finally seen the light 
and i have finally realized
 realized 
i need to love
i need to love

come to me, just in a dream
come on and rescue me
yes i know i can be wrong
maybe you're too headstrong
our love is...

on the mountain where i was born
there are trees that would call my name
on the wind, they would bring a song
for every feral lead to claim
they said keep your eyes open
and we'll teach you to dream while you are awake
well, they haven't spoken
since their branches were broken for the fire that they told me to

feral roots calling me back home
feral roots are calling me back home

on the book where my page was torn
there are words that i don't understand
all my elders they tell me those ones
were not written by human hands
well, i just don't believe that's true
if the truth can be written, then the truth can be hid
those words are commanding you
though your body may grow old in your mind
you must remain a kid

feral roots are calling me back home
feral roots calling me back home
feral roots calling me back home
feral roots calling me back home

you used to get it in your fishnets
now you only get it in your night dress
discarded all the naughty nights for niceness
landed in a very common crisis
everything's in order in a black hole
nothing seems as pretty as the past though
that bloody mary's lacking in tabasco
remember when you used to be a rascal?

oh, the boy's a slag, the best you ever had
the best you ever had is just a memory and those dreams

my love, when you dream them up

flicking through a little book of sex tips
remember when the boys were all electric?
now when she's told she's gonna get it
i'm guessing that she'd rather just forget it
clinging to not getting sentimental
said she wasn't going but she went still
likes her gentlemen not to be gentle
was it a mecca dauber or a betting pencil?

oh, the boy's a slag, the best you ever had
the best you ever had is just a memory and those dreams
weren't daft as they seem, not as daft as they seem

coming like a hell bent killing machine

undefeated counterfeit cunts with a reason to fear

'68 into the world born
and the seventies, a breath after the war
life was confusing because of my age
should my eyes open for tomorrow s gains?
i can't help the way i am
there's no trust and there's no end
what is my name?

it will never change
so here it stays
forever is my name

from now on, can't look the other way
keep in mind and listen to what i say
take under wing all the ones who are lost
build up around them an infinite wall
don't you know just who i am?
take the hand of wisdom's friend
what is my name?

it's time to change
it can't stay the same
revolution is my name


what is my name? 
forever
what is my name? 
revolution




waters of chaos have invaded all space
the flood on earth again, i have to find the whales
that once did guide us to dry lands of life
i won't despair, i'll break this dark around

under heavy sea
i'll search the flight of whales

beneath the seas, i searched and had a different view
of us on earth, the sinking ship of men
but it's beyond the stars, i found the place where
they were, and they finally came to light

over the winds, they dwell in light
like the arrow in the sky, i found myself on higher grounds from up here
for i see them always in flight

now i can see the whales
looming out of the dark
like arrows in the sky
i can't believe my eyes, but it's true

huge tunnel ends in light
like banks of clouds, they gather
see massive shape of flesh
swimming giants in the clear
the mightiest comes to me
i'm on the wing, wide open
they teach me how to fly
slowly moving in the air

so much told with no words at all
powerful presence for only speech
breath

over the winds, they dwell in light
fly

crawl through the flames
that eat your flesh
drowned in the waters
that know you best
step inside
i've been waiting here for you
on your knees where you shall crawl
flying so high, you never fall
step inside
we've been waiting here for you
bow down, you chose your maker
he never gives, he's always a taker
the electric burns that fuel the fire
it's just your suicide messiah
bow down, you chose your maker
he never gives, he's always a taker
electric burns that fuel the fire
it's just your suicide messiah
walk through the streets
that know your name
all that's pure is now insane
step inside
i've been waiting here for you
another trip, another lie
life's hand of doom
you're feeling fine
step inside
we've been waiting here for you
bow down, you chose your maker
never gives, he's always a taker
the electric burns that fuel the fire
it's just your suicide messiah
bow down, you chose your maker
he never gives, he's always a taker
electric burns that fuel the fire
it's just your suicide messiah
bow down, you chose your maker
he never gives, he's always a taker
bow down, you chose your maker
he never gives, he's always a taker
electric burns that fuel the fire

an ending fitting for the start
you twist'n'tore our love apart
your light fingers threw the dart
that shattered the lamp and into darkness cast us

you were waiting for an answer
it was the hardest thing to hear
so strung out eclipsed by shivers
molleycoddled and sincere

it's a lonely life, a long and lonely life
stay with me and
be a ghost tonight, be a ghost tonight

but don't you be so cold

you were waiting for elation
like it would fall out of the sky
maybe time's the greatest healer
but baby everything will die

it's a lonely life, a long and lonely life
stay with me and
be a ghost tonight, be a ghost tonight

once i thought the world was crazy
everyone was sad and chasing
happiness and love and
i was the only one above it
once i thought without a doubt
i had it all figured out
universe with hands unseen
i was cold as gasoline

took too long to think
i was wrong to believe in me only

once my life was a game so unfair
it beat me down and kept me there
unaware of my naysayer
solitaire was all i was playing


como nicolas cage en leaving las vegas
veo caer la nieve en la hierba
un robinson en una isla desierta
como nicolas cage en leaving las vegas
soy el invierno contra tu primavera
un dorian gray sin pasado ni patria ni bandera
ser  tu voz, ser  el licor
ser n las luces de esta habitaci n
ser  el poder de una canci n
pero esta noche morir a por vos
ser  el champagne, ser  el color de tus ojos verdes
de ciencia ficci n
la última cena para los dos
pero esta noche morir a por vos
como nicolas cage en leaving las vegas
no tengo planes m s all  de esta cena
es un misterio hacia d nde la noche nos lleva
como nicolas cage en leaving las vegas
vamos, mi ni o, a perder la cabeza
como si fuera nuestro último d a en la tierra
ser  tu voz, ser  el licor
ser n las luces de esta habitaci n
ser  que suena marquee moon

i'm gonna fight 'em off
a seven nation army couldn't hold me back
they're gonna rip it off
taking their time right behind my back
and i'm talking to myself at night
because i can't forget
back and forth through my mind
behind a cigarette

and the message coming from my eyes
says "leave it alone"


don't want to hear about it
every single one's got a story to tell
everyone knows about it
from the queen of england to the hounds of hell
and if i catch it coming back my way
i'm gonna serve it to you
and that ain't what you want to hear
but that's what i'll do

and the feeling coming from my bones
says "find a home"



i'm going to wichita
far from this opera forevermore
i'm gonna work the straw
make the sweat drip out of every pore
and i'm bleeding, and i'm bleeding, and i'm bleeding
right before the lord
all the words are gonna bleed from me
and i will think no more

and the stains coming from my blood
tell me "go back home"



we're rolling "suicide"

time has come and time is gone
cities burn, we got youth to spend
and time to waste in love
to live again, my friend
through the flames and through the fire
cities burn, we don't give a damn
'cause we got all our friends right here
we got youth to spend

'cause time away from me
is what i need to clear my sight and clear my head
i'm coming down over it, coming down over

when all is said and all is done
our fathers run and leave all the damage
they've done behind
left us with the blind leading the blind
and time has come and time is done
cities burn, we don't give a damn
'cause we got all our friends right here
we got youth to spend

time away from me is what i need
to clear my sight and clear my head
i'm coming down over it, coming down over
coming down over
i'll be right there, i'm coming down over it
coming down over again

be right there, i'll be right there
down i go, i'll scream, i'll go down again
i feel my blood, i did my time
i'm deep in my head, i'm deep in my way
i'm deep in my soul
here i go
i'll be right there

i'm over it now, over it now, over it, i'm over it
over it, over it, over it
going over it, over and over it
finally over it, over it, over it
over and over it, over and over it
i mean over it, over and over it
over it, over and over it
over and over it

started out last night, i was thinking of days gone by
of the times i've had and the things that i've left behind
some change, some die, still we manage to survive
it's knowing when and what to do, it's up to you
don't know what's going on, i can't wait 'til

one summer, i'll find a way
one summer will always remain
one summer, remember the way

hauled down, turned around, find myself facing the wall
i think back to school, it's all the same, slightly different rules
outside on your own, watch yourself 'cause you're all alone
i know what's going on, i can't wait 'til

one summer, i'll find a way
one summer will always remain
one summer, remember the way
one summer, never the same

oh oh oh oh oh
i think back not far, driving down the beach in my car
another place, same time, icky runs along a fine line
down there, no chance, he's trapped in a different romance
his life a fait accompli, he never did see

one summer, i'll find a way
one summer will always remain
one summer, remember the way
one summer, never the same
one summer, i'll find a way
one summer will always remain
one summer, remember the way
one summer, i'll find a way
one summer will always remain

go 

stapled shut, inside an outside world and i'm
sealed in tight, bizarre but right at home
claustrophobic, closing in and i'm catastrophic, not again
i'm smeared across the page and doused in gasoline
i wear you like a stain yet i'm the one who's obscene
catch me up on all your sordid little insurrections
i've got no time to lose, i'm just caught up in all the cattle

fray the strings 
throw the shapes 
hold your breath 
listen 

i am a world before i am a man
i was a creature before i could stand
i will remember before i forget
before i forget that 
i am a world before i am a man
i was a creature before i could stand
i will remember before i forget
before i forget that 

i'm ripped across the ditch and settled in the dirt and i
wear you like a stitch yet i'm the one who's hurt
pay attention to your twisted little indiscretions
i've got no right to win, i'm just caught up in all the battles

locked in clutch 
pushed in place 
hold your breath 
listen 

i am a world before i am a man
i was a creature before i could stand
i will remember before i forget
before i forget that 
i am a world before i am a man
i was a creature before i could stand
i will remember before i forget
before i forget that 

my end, it justifies my means
all i ever do is delay
my every attempt to evade
the end of the road
and my end, it justifies my means

yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh 


quit moaning about fate and change
stand up on your feet and rise
with every fall you get the pain, you learn the lesson
start now, open your eyes
dead bodies falling from the sky
we are the ape with the vision of the killing
a rain of shame that fills the mines
no other blood in me but mine

time to open your eyes to this genocide
when you clear your mind, you see it all
you're receiving the gold of a better life
when you change yourself, you change the world

your heart is pounding in the brain
as they drag you naked in the mud
a devil's dancing in the rain
how could you fall so low?

no, we will never let go
let us watch them die


time to open your eyes to this genocide
when you clear your mind, you see it all
you're receiving the gold of a better life
when you change yourself, you change the world

i need your arms around me
i need to feel your touch
i need your understanding, i need your love
so much
you tell me that you love me so
you tell me that you care
but when i need you,  baby 
baby,  you're never there 
on the phone
long long distance
always through such
strong resistance
when first you say
you're too busy
i wonder if you
even miss me
never there
you're never there
you're never, ever
ever ever there
a golden bird that flies away
a candle's fickle flame
to think i held you yesterday
your love was just a game
a golden bird that flies away
a candle's fickle flame
to think i held you yesterday
your love was just a game
you tell me that you love me so
you tell me that you care
but when i need you,  baby 
baby
take the time
to get to know me
if you want me
why can't you just show me
we're always on
this roller coaster
if you want me
why can't you get closer
never there
you're never there
you're never, ever
ever ever there
never there
you're never there
you're never, ever
ever ever there

uptown girl
she's been living in her uptown world
i bet she's never had a backstreet guy
i bet her momma never told her why
i'm gonna try for an

uptown girl
she's been living in her white bread world
as long as anyone with hot blood can
and now she's looking for a downtown man
that's what i am
and when she knows what
she wants from her time
and when she wakes up
and makes up her mind

she'll see i'm not so tough
just because
i'm in love with an
uptown girl
you know i've seen her in her uptown world
she's getting tired of her high class toys
and all her presents from her uptown boys
she's got a choice
uptown girl
you know i can't afford to buy her pearls
but maybe someday when my ship comes in
she'll understand what kind of guy i've been
and then i'll win
and when she's walking
she's looking so fine
and when she's talking
she'll say that she's mine

she'll say i'm not so tough
just because
i'm in love with an

uptown girl
she's been living in her white bread world
as long as anyone with hot blood can
and now she's looking for a downtown man
that's what i am

i've been caught stealing;
once when i was 5...
i enjoy stealing
it's just as simple as that
well, it's just a simple fact
when i want something
i don't want to pay for it
i walk right through the door
walk right through the door
hey all right  if i get by, it's mine
mine all mine 
my girl, she's one too
she'll go and get her a skirt
stick it under her shirt
she grabbed a razor for me
and she did it just like that
when she wants something
she don't want to pay for it
she walk right through the door
walk right through the door
hey all right  if i get by, it's mine
mine all mine 
we sat around the pile
we sat and laughed
we sat and laughed and
waved it into the air 
and we did it just like that
when we want something
we don't want to pay for it
we walk right through the door
walk right through the door
hey, all right  if i get by, it's mine
mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine...


reluctantly crouched at the starting line
engines pumping and thumping in time
the green light flashes, the flags go up
churning and burning, they yearn for the cup
they deftly maneuver and muscle for rank
fuel burning fast on an empty tank
reckless and wild, they pour through the turns
their prowess is potent and secretly stern
as they speed through the finish, the flags go down
the fans get up and they get out of town
the arena is empty except for one man
still driving and striving as fast as he can

the sun has gone down and the moon has come up
and long ago somebody left with the cup
but he's driving and striving and hugging the turns
and thinking of someone for whom he still burns

he's going the distance
he's going for speed
she's all alone
in her time of need
because he's racing and pacing and plotting the course
he's fighting and biting and riding on his horse
he's going the distance

no trophy, no flowers, no flashbulbs, no wine
he's haunted by something he cannot define
bowel shaking earthquakes of doubt and remorse
assail him, impale him with monster truck force
in his mind, he's still driving, still making the grade
she's hoping in time that her memories will fade
cause he's racing and pacing and plotting the course
he's fighting and biting and riding on his horse

down in the gutter and looking for trouble
or something to that effect
and there she was, a metal cross ironically 'round her neck
and then she kissed me on the lips
and a fever came without a warning
said give me a holla
and then i will follow you down into the dark
and i was left in the depths surrounding her feral heart
oh, there's just something about the sun
that seems so very, very boring

what did you think when you made me this way?
what did you think when you left me this way?
hold me so close when we get to the gates
and we'll be together forever and ever and more

if you desire then you be my fire and i'll be your gasoline
i'm getting sick of all the kicks this city is selling me
and she said: "hey, let's get away
and i'll be your new religion, baby"

what did you think when you made me this way?
what did you think when you left me this way?
hold me so close when we get to the gates
and we'll be together forever and ever and more

 hold me close 
 smother me 
 hold me close 
 smother me 
 hold me close 
 smother me 
 hold me close 
 smother me 
 hold me close 
 smother me 
 hold me close 
 smother me 
 hold me close 
 smother me 
 hold me close 
 smother me 
hold me close
my little draculove
wrap your arms around me
my draculove
my draculove

what did you think when you made me this way?
what did you think when you left me this way?
hold me so close when we get to the gates
and we'll be together forever and ever and more


walk into the venue, you slipped me your cd
asked me if i'd listen, give you my critique
i listened to it, but halfway through it
i had to quit, your band sounds like shit

so, here we go
don't get mad at me, i'm just being honest
i should have lied
don't get mad at me, i'm just being honest

walk into the bedroom, you were standing there
turned around and smiled at me and said you just cut your hair
but then i told you i thought you looked better before
you said, "hope you like sleeping on the floor"

so, here we go
don't get mad at me, i'm just being honest
i should have lied
now you're mad at me, i'm just being honest
how 'bout from now on you'll write the script, i'll read the lines
so, here we go
don't get mad at me, i'm just being honest

and now i'm staring at her napkin
with seven digits that i can't make out
she wrote it down in purple lipstick
i shoulda never, i shoulda never opened up
and maybe it's because i'm irish
i just couldn't keep my big mouth shut
is that an eight, is that a zero?
i should have never, i should have never opened up

so, here we go
don't get mad at me, i'm just being honest
i should have lied
now you're mad at me, i'm just being honest
how 'bout from now on you'll write the script, i'll read the lines
so, here we go
don't get mad at me, i'm just being honest  i'm just being honest 

whoa oh oh  i'm just being honest 
whoa oh oh  i'm just being honest 


do you wanna start a cult with me?
i'm not vibrating like i oughta be
i need a purpose, i can't keep surfing
through this existential misery
now, we're gonna need some real estate
but if i choose my words carefully
think i could fool you that i'm the guru
wait, how do you spell "epiphany"?

before the truth will set you free, it'll piss you off
before you find a place to be, you're gonna lose the plot
too late to tell you now, one ear and right out the other one
'cause all you ever do is chant the same old mantra
yeah 

could i have your attention, please?
it s time to tap into your tragedy
think you could use a new abuser
close your eyes and listen carefully
imagine you're stood on a beach
water gently lapping at your feet
but now you're sinking, what were you thinking?
that's all the time we have this week

before the truth will set you free, it'll piss you off
before you find a place to be, you're gonna lose the plot
too late to tell you now, one ear and right out the other one
'cause all you ever do is chant the same old mantra

and i know this doesn't make a lot of sense
but do you really wanna think all by yourself now?
all i'm asking for's a little bit of faith
you know it's easy to believe
and i know this doesn't make a lot of sense
you know you gotta work the corners of your mind now
all i'm asking for's a little bit of faith
you know it's easy to, so easy to believe

before the truth will set you free, it'll piss you off
before you find a place to be, you're gonna lose the plot
before the truth will set you free, it'll piss you off
before you find a place to be, you're gonna lose the plot
too late to tell you now, one ear and right out the other one
'cause all you ever do is chant the same old mantra
oh 


now the sea eats the sky
but they say it's a lie
there's no birds left to fly
we'll hide out
oh, the weather's against us
houses underground
the flowers upside down
in our dreams
in the eye of the storm
the land where you were born
try to make no sound
we hide out
'cause they watch us in sleep
the language that we speak
and the secrets that we keep

in our dreams, in our dreams, in our dreams
in our dreams, in our dreams, in our dreams

i said i'm so sorry
to have kept you waiting around
i wish i could've come up
i could've shouted out loud
they got exits covered
all the exits underground
i wish i could figure it out
but the world's upside down
in a world upside down

oh, to dream this all off
in the islands of the mind
the places they can't find
we'll hide out
and the black sky came down
and the cities underground
the flowers upside down
in our dreams
oh, to meet you again
to pass you on the stairs
to see you everywhere
in my dreams
'cause they watch us in sleep
and the language that we speak
and the secrets that we keep

to ourselves in our dreams, in our dreams
in our dreams, in our dreams, in our dreams

i said i'm so sorry
to have kept you waiting around
i wish i could've come up
i could've shouted out loud
they got exits covered
all the exits underground
i wish i could figure it out
but the world's upside down

i said i'm so sorry
that the world has fallen down
i wish i could do something more
i could shout it out loud
they got exits covered
all the exits underground
i wish i could figure it out
but the world's upside down
in a world upside down


 up 
 upside down, oh 
 upside down, oh 
 upside down, oh 

back to the days of yore, when we were sure of a good long summer
i hope you could be found out of ground, our long lost brother
we share all of our dreams into the screen but not with each other
back to the days of yore, when we were sure of a good long summer
i hope you could be found out of ground, our long lost brother
we share all of our dreams into the screen but not with each other
back to the days of yore, when we were sure of a good long summer


i'm trapped and my back's up against the wall
i see no solution or exit out
i'm grinding it out, no one can see
the pressure's growing exponentially
i'm trying to keep up to speed with you
your lane changing is oscillating me
i'm hitting the ground and i'm sprinting
i'm falling behind now i'm tuning out

i see your corruption
i'm not blind
i'll carry the burden and take the strain
and when i am done i will make you pay

some people are a lot like clouds, you know
 clouds, you know, clouds, you know 
'cause life's so much brighter when they go
you rained on my heart for far too long  far too long 
couldn't see the thunder for the storm
because i cut my teeth and bit my tongue
till my mouth was dripping blood
but i never dished the dirt, just held my breath
while you dragged me through the mud
i don't know why i tried to save you 'cause
i can't save you from yourself
when all you give a shit about is everybody else

and you just can't quit, why don't you deal with it?
i think it's time to stop

you need a taste of your own medicine
'cause i'm sick to death of swallowing
watch me take the wheel like you, not feel like you
act like nothing's real like you
so i'm sorry for this, it might sting a bit

some people are a lot like clouds, you know
 clouds, you know, clouds, you know 
'cause life's so much brighter when they go

i couldn't see the thunder for the storm

but you won't admit, why don't you get a grip?
'cause you can't keep going on and on and on and on like this
and you just can't quit, why don't you deal with it?
i think it's time to stop

you need a taste of your own medicine
'cause i'm sick to death of swallowing

climb into my corner, my self inflicted coma
stand up, lay down, repeat in the same order
fall straight through the floor and let the time just run me over
another mirrored image corrupted and distorted
i'm underwhelmed, uninterested, i wonder why i'm over it
walk it off, the kettle's black
the dotted line, the house is glass

 the house is glass  the house is glass
 the house is glass  the house is glass

it's an illusion, this admiration
of mutilation, my isolation
it's an illusion, this admiration
of mutilation, my isolation, my isolation
my isolation, it's an illusion

slide on down the staircase, that picture perfect moment
receiver projected, act like if you own it
smile for the camera, repeat and do it over
smile for the camera, repeat and do it over
joke's on you, the needle prick
cut me down, i need a break
walk it off, the kettle's black
the dotted line, this house is glass

 the house is glass  the house is glass
 the house is glass  the house is glass

it's an illusion, this admiration
of mutilation, my isolation

sun went down, sun went down over pompeii
on both sides the vow was broken
oh my my, i'm the one
trying to hide this damage done
one day, all our secrets will be spoken

as we slow dance, i became your statue, frozen
 times i wonder, are we just a puff of smoke? yeah
underneath this bed of ashes, still withholding everything
like we were never close

don't you worry baby, no sense trying to change it
i'mma strike these matches, never had control
i m ready to let go, no, was i fooling myself
i'mma spread these ashes, never had control
i'm ready, i'm ready, i'm ready to let go

sun went down, sun went down over pompeii
on holy ground, our vows were broken
we met up, we broke bread
i was blue, your dress was red, ain't it strange?
we both knew this day was coming

as we slow dance, i became your statue, frozen
'times i wonder, are we just a puff of smoke? yeah
underneath this bed of ashes, still withholding everything
like we were never close

don't you worry baby, no sense trying to change it
i mma strike these matches, never had control
i m ready to let go, no, was i fooling myself
i'mma spread these ashes, never had control
i m ready, i'm ready, i'm ready to let go

don't you worry baby, no sense trying to change it
i mma strike these matches never had control
i'm ready to let go, no, was i fooling myself
i'mma spread these ashes, never had control
i'm ready, i'm ready, i'm ready to let go


i lost my land like i lost my way
so no loose ends
nothing to see me down
how are we going to work this out?

dreams are bad, our heads are mad
i love the girl
but god only knows it's
getting hard to see the sun coming through
i love you...
but what are we going to do?

picture i'm a dreamer
i'll take you deeper
down to the sleepy glow
time is a low
don't you know?
what are we going to do?
when we go down
for all the sacred selfless days
only left with heartache
i want to see you again
i love you...
but what are we going to do?



been dazed and confused for so long it's not true
wanted a woman, never bargained for you
lots of people talk and few of them know
soul of a woman was created below, yeah

you hurt and abuse telling all of your lies
run around sweet baby, lord how they hypnotize
sweet little baby, i don't know where you've been
gonna love you baby, here i come again

if you're going to san francisco
be sure to wear some flowers in your hair
if you're going to san francisco
you're gonna meet a lot of gentle people there

every day i work so hard bringing home my hard earned pay
try to love you baby, but you push me away
don't know where you're going, only know just where you've been
sweet little baby, i want you again


been dazed and confused for so long it's not true
wanted a woman, never bargained for you
take it easy baby, let them say what they will
did your tongue wag so much when i sent you the bill?


sick at heart and lonely
deep in dark despair
thinking one thought only
"where is she, tell me where?"

and if she says to you
she don't love me
just give her my message
tell her of my plea

and i know
that if she had me back again
i would never make her sad
i've got a heart full of soul


and i know
if she had me back again
i would never make her sad
i've got a heart full of soul

she's been gone such a long time
longer than i can bear
but if she says she wants me
tell her that i'll be there

and if she says to you
she don't love me
just give her my message
tell her of my plea

and i know
that if she had me back again
i would never make her sad
i've got a heart full of soul

good morning to you, i hope you're feeling better, baby
thinking of me while you are far away
counting the days until they set you free again
writing this letter hoping you're okay
saved you the room you used to stay in every sunday
the one that is warmed by sunshine every day
and we'll get to know each other for a second time
and then you can tell me 'bout your prison stay
feels so good you're coming home soon
it's gonna to be good to have you back again with me
watching the laughter play around your eyes
come up and fetch you, saved up for the train fare money
kiss and make up and it will be so nice
feels so good you're coming home soon
walking the way we used to walk
and it could be so nice
we're talking the way we used to talk
and it could be so nice
it's gonna be good to have you back again with me
watching the laughter play around your eyes
come up and fetch you, saved up for the train fare money
kiss and make up and it will be so nice
feels so good you're coming home soon
feels so good you're coming home soon

come gather 'round people, wherever you roam
and admit that the waters around you have grown
and accept it that soon you ll be drenched to the bone
if your time to you is worth saving
then you better start swimmin' or you ll sink like a stone
for the times they are a changin'
come writers and critics, who prophesize with your pen
and keep your eyes wide, the chance won t come again
and don t speak too soon
for the wheel s still in spin
and there s no tellin' who that it s namin'
for the loser now will be later to win
for the times they are a changin'
come senators, congressmen, please heed the call
don t stand in the doorway, don t block up the hall
for he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled
the battle outside ragin'
will soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
for the times they are a changin'
come mothers and fathers throughout the land
and don t criticize what you can t understand
your sons and your daughters are beyond your command
your old road is rapidly aging
please get outta' the new one if you can t lend your hand
for the times they are a changin'
the line it is drawn, the curse it is cast
the slow one now will later be fast
as the present now will later be past
the order is rapidly fading
and the first one now will later be last
for the times they are a changin'

dani the girl is singing songs to me
beneath the marquee
overload

steak knife, card shark
con job, boot cut
skin that flick, she's such a little dj
to get there quick by street but not the freeway

dogtown, blood bath
rib cage, soft tail

black jack, dope dick
pawn shop, quick pick
kiss that dyke, i know you want to hold one
not on strike but i'm about to bowl one
bite that mic, i know you never stole one
girls that like a story, so i told one
song bird, main line
cash back, hard top

standing in line to see the show tonight

i'm looking at you through the glass
don't know how much time has passed
oh, god, it feels like forever, but no one ever tells you
that forever feels like home, sitting all alone inside your head

how do you feel? that is the question
but i forget you don't expect an easy answer
when something like a soul becomes initialized and folded up
like paper dolls and little notes, you can t expect a bit of hope

so while you re outside looking in, describing what you see
remember what you re staring at is me

 cause i m looking at you through the glass
don t know how much time has passed
all i know is that it feels like forever, but no one ever tells you
that forever feels like home, sitting all alone inside your head

how much is real? so much to question
an epidemic of the mannequins, contaminating everything
we thought came from the heart, but never did right from the start
just listen to the noises, null and void instead of voices

before you tell yourself, it's just a different scene
remember it's just different from what you've seen

i'm looking at you through the glass
don't know how much time has passed
and all i know is that it feels like forever, but no one ever tells you
that forever feels like home, sitting all alone inside your head
'cause i'm looking at you through the glass
don't know how much time has passed
and all i know is that it feels like forever, but no one ever tells you
that forever feels like home, sitting all alone inside your head

and it's the stars, the stars
that shine for you
and it's the stars, the stars
that lie to you, yeah ah
