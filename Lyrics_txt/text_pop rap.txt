

1988 senior year at garvey high
where all the guys were corny but the girls were mad fly
lounging with the tipster, cooling with sha
scoping out the honeys they know who they are
i was the b ball playing, fly rhyme saying
fly girl getting but never was i sweating
'cause when it came to honeys i would go on a stroll
until i met my match her name was flo
yeah, i messed around with the one called flo
all the troopers 'round the way used to call her a ho
but deep down in my heart i knew that flo was good to go
'cause i thought it was me like bell biv devoe
but little did i know that she was playing with my mind
the only thing i learned is good girls are hard to find
i feel like heavy d, i need somebody for me
not someone whose mind is blank and tryna juice me for my banks
swinging with my main man lucky behind my back
what type of crap is that yo, how's about a smack?
word life, i can't front, thought i was all that
but now it seems, i've met my match
i was a stone cold lover, you couldn't tell me jack
settling down with one girl, wasn't trying to hear that
i had tonya, tamika, sharon, karen
tina, stacy, julie, tracy
used to love 'em, leave 'em, skeeze 'em, tease 'em
find 'em, lose 'em   also abuse 'em
my whole attitude was new day, next hon
and believe it or not, they all got done
well here comes flo with the crazy whip appeal
and i'm all true man like alexander o'neal
is this really love, then again how would i know
after all this time trying to be a super ho
she finally played me, but yo i'd find another
'cause i got the crazy game and yo, i'm smooth like butter

ayo, it's like butter, it's like butter baby
it's like butter, it's like butter baby
it's like butter, it's like butter baby
it's like butter, it's like butter baby
it's like butter, it's like butter baby
it's like butter, it's like the butter baby
not no parkay, not no margarine
strictly butter, strictly butter, baby

i remember when girls were goodie two shoes but now they turning freaks
all of a sudden  we love you phife   ease off ho, my name's malik
phife this, phife that, where you going, where you at
these girls don't know me from jack, yet i feel like the mack
you didn't want me then, so yo hon, don't want me now
here, here   take the towel, wipe off your brow
and take the contact out your eye, you're far from looking fly
you get an e for effort, and t for nice try
now tell me what's the reason, for dying your hair
slum village gold still dangling in your ear
you barely have a neck but still sporting a rope
four finger ring just so phifer can scope
you looked in the mirror, didn't know what to do
yesterday your eyes were brown but today they are blue
your whole appearance is a lie and it could never be true
and if you really liked yourself then you would try and be you
if your hair and eyes were real, i wouldn't have dissed ya
but since it was bought, i had to dismiss ya
but if you can't achieve it, then why not try and weave it
if you can't extend it then you might as well suspend it
if you can't braid it, best thing to do is fade it
i asked who did your hair and you tell me, "diane made it"
if you were you and just you, talk to you, maybe
but i can't stand, no bionic lady
trying hard to look fly, but yo, you're looking dumber
if i wanted someone like you i would've swung with jaime sommers
you wanna be treated right, see father mc
or check ralph tresvant, for sensitivity
'cause i am not the one, i got more game than parker brothers
phife dawg is on the mic and i'm smooth like butter


yo, microphone check one, two, what is this?
the five foot assassin with the roughneck business
i float like gravity, never had a cavity
got more rhymes than the winans got family
no need to sweat arsenio to gain some type of fame
no shame in my game cause i'll always be the same
styles upon styles upon styles is what i have
you wanna diss the phifer but you still don't know the half
i sport new balance sneakers to avoid a narrow path
mess around with this you catch a size eight up your ass
i never half step cause i'm not a half stepper
drink a lot of soda so they call me dr. pepper
refuse to compete with bs competition
your name ain't special ed
so won't you seckle with the mission
i never walk the street thinking it's all about me
even though deep in my heart, it really could be
i just try my best to like go all out
some might even say yo shorty black you're buggin' out

zulu nation, brothers last creation
minds get flooded, ejaculation
right on the two inch tape
the abstract poet incognito, runs the cape
not the best not the worst and occasionally i curse
to get my point across, so bust, the floss
as i go in between, the grit and the dirt
listen to the mission listen miss as i do work, umm
as i crack the, monotone
children of the jazz so, get your own
smokin r b cause they try to do me
or the best of the pack but they can't do rap
for it's abstract, original
you can't get your own and that's, pitiful
i know i'd be the man if i cold yanked the plug
on r b, but i can't and that's bugged

buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out

yo when you bug out
you usually have a reason for the action
sometimes you do it just for mere satisfaction
people be hounding, always surrounding
pulsing, just like a migraine pounding
you don't really fret, you stay in your sense
camouflage your feeling, of absolute tense
you soar off to another world, deep in your mind
but people seem to take that, as being unkind
"oh yo he's acting stank," really on a regal?
a man of the fame not a man of the people
believe that if you wanna but i tell you this much
riding on the train with no dough, sucks
once again a case of your feet in my nike's
if a crowd is in my realm i'm saying    mic please
hip hop is living, can't yank the plug
if you do the result, will end up kind of bugged

yo, i am not an invalid although
i used to smoke the weed out
ali shaheed muhammad used to say i had to be out
scheming on the cookies with the crazy booming back buns
pushing on them real hard just so we can have the big fun
when i left for road, see, i was boulevard status
battling a mc was when tip was at his maddest
it was one mc after one mc
what the world could they be wanting see from little old me
do i have the formula to save the world?
or was it just because i used to
swipe the women and all the girls
i'm the type of brother with the crazy extended hand, kid
dissed by all my brothers i was all up what my man did
supposed to be my man
but now i wonder cause you're feeble
i go out with the strongies and i separate the evils
it's your brain against my mind, for those about to boot out
all you nasty critters even though you see i bug out

buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out


woo...grand groove, grand groove
woo...grand groove, grand groove

rough, rough, rugged
tough like a nugget
listen to the abstract poetic, don't snub it
the midnight marauder is the hype beat arranger
don't front on my lyrics or the tool 'cause it's danger
hook you like a junkie, you'll flip like a monkey
to the openness of the rhythm, so proceed because i'm funky
i get down, down like a fly hooker's panties
make you catch a spirit and motivate a fanny
i be the fly poet, rappers, they get jelly
upset when i rock, 'cause yo, they rhymes is smelly
see, i got it going on like a forbes tax return
listening to these lyrics when it's hot will make it burn
baby burn, baby burn, up into the heavens
the skies up above, the one you think of
is the highly regarded, hell of the people
your mic and my mic? come on, yo, no equal  word  
so if ya wanna do it to yourself
that is to mess around with the jazz, then just blame yourself
'cause you made your bed, so now you lay in it
that's your shit on the floor, then go and play in it
i refuse to catch a 'l' in a battle
'cause yo, i got the jazz and i'll whup a rapper's ass
into little next to nuthin'
test me if i'm frontin'
i'll pass with flying colors 'cause yo, i am that brotha that can rock

who got the jazz?  we've got the jazz 
who got the jazz?  we've got the jazz 
who got the jazz?  we've got the jazz 
who got the jazz?  we've got the jazz 
we've got the jazz, we've got the jazz, come on

no need for introductions 'cause you know who i be
 the phife dawg  yep, the one who loves to slaugher mc's
i got style, grace and razamatazz
i'm like my girl patrice rushen, yo, i add pizzazz, now
most people remember phife from the phife like smoothness
but now it's time to hit you with roughneck rudeness
i'm still vexed, fuming, gots to come raw
the first punk that tries to flex, i'll be cracking your jaw
i'll mold you, fold you, roll you up like a spliff
don't ever try for test or else that ass will get whipped
i'm forever poppin' junk, it's like a fat invite
to any mc who wants to flex, yo, we can do this tonight
gel up my posse up on linden and 1 9 2
pull up my brothas from sayers ave., the brooklyn zoo
all my crew up in strong island, so yo, don't sleep
'cause it only takes a beat to watch that ass get beat
brothas wanna play rough, but they can all get some
wanna be hero, but you're a zero, that means you gets none
don't ever try to step to a kid you can't get with
why mess with a brotha that your girl once slept with?
i'm a negro, he's a negro, wanna be a negro too?
but beatin' on a girl, is somethin' that a puss' would do
i love jazz, but that doesn't mean that i'm timid
not really a gangsta rapper but i can swing it for a minute

who got the jazz?  we've got the jazz 
who got the jazz?  we've got the jazz 
who got the jazz?  we've got the jazz 
who got the jazz?  we've got the jazz 
come on

 ad lib 


all we want in this life
is peace, prosperity and a little paper
objects, they seem greater
but i'm sure we overcome when we illin' on a drum

we in a world that places heavy emphasis on money synthesis
y'all can be my witnesses
that a fella fascination with money has grown
to the point that he will shit on his own
we got to have it y'all, its not a spike lee cinematic
a piece of paper making niggas get dramatic
but the money doesn't come automatic
gotta motivate ourselves to go and grab it
we got to get it y'all, in an orderly fashion
some cats go about it with too much passion
we got to mediate our greedy levels
'cause the lust of currency can have us sleepin with the devil
gotta recognize it, realize the power
that this little ma huckin piece of paper will devour
man can be greater than the thing he creates
see, i'mma do my thing and see how much i can scrape
yo, i'd rather have respect than money, no doubt
but listen to me y'all, i want the mass amount
that the sesame street dracula can't count
so that i can give my people when that thing surmounts
to higher levels.. of being.. so when i'm mc ing
i hope to see you there steady g ing  say word 
but the only way we can truly reach that goal
is finding true inner peace and prospering souls
it's like that


here comes your royal highness, one of queens finest
believe me, honest, you know you can't stop it
come on son, never leave your mic 'round me
true mc for real, ask my man shaheed
strictly focused on what i'm in this rap game for
not for fame and screwing every whore after whore
with all that aids stuff going round
tell me how that sound
rather hit the studio and hear some beats that pound
now, don't get me wrong, i love honeys galore
but see hip hop's my bread and butter
'cause that's what i get paid for
see this is what i wanted, allah helped me to get it
and if the beat is wicked, you know malik will rip it
from the bottom of my heart, that's where the love starts
the love for breakdancing, my love for the art
and with this love i do hip hop from the soul
a real mc, who never sweats how many copies are sold
yeah, i want to go gold, platinum, uh huh, etcetera
but why put out some wackness when no one will respect ya?
i'm staying true, nuff respect to those that paved the way
from bambaataa down to shah; that be my dj
without my peeps i don't know how the hell i'd make it, word
sometimes i feel that my career is headed for the curb
one love for lending hand and giving all your help
believing in me when i didn't believe in my own self
the abstract with whom i'm always making rugged tunes
kid hood resting in heaven, i hope to see you soon
i keep things hot and this year they're even hotter
big mu and shah, one day i'll take my shahada
out


look into my eyes
you will see what you mean to me
search your heart, search your soul
oh, when you find me there you'll search no more

don't tell me it's not worth tryin' for
you can't tell me it's not worth dyin' for
you know it's true, everything i do, i do it for you

look into your heart, you will find
there is nothin' there to hide
take me as i am, take my life
i would give it all, i would sacrifice

don't tell me it's not worth tryin' for
you can't tell me it's not worth dyin' for
you know it's true, everything i do, i do it for you

there is no love, like your love
an' no other could give me more love
there's nowhere, unless your there
all the time, all the way

you can't tell me it's not worth tryin' for
i just can't help it, there's nothin' in the world i want more
oh, i would fight for you
yeah, i'd lie for you
walk the wire for you
yeah, i'd die for you

you know it's true, everything i do, i do it for you


i'm still alive but i'm barely breathing
just praying to a god that i don't believe in
'cause i got time while she got freedom
'cause when a heart breaks no it don't break even

her best days will be some of my worst
she finally met a man that's gonna put her first
while i'm wide awake she's no trouble sleeping
'cause when a heart breaks no it don't breakeven
even... no

what am i supposed to do when the best part of me was always you?
and what am i supposed to say when i'm all choked up and you're ok?
i'm falling to pieces, yeah
i'm falling to pieces

they say bad things happen for a reason
but no wise words gonna stop the bleeding
'cause she's moved on while i'm still grieving
and when a heart breaks no it don't breakeven even, even
... no

what am i gonna do when the best part of me was always you?
and what am i supposed to say when i'm all choked up and you're ok?
i'm falling to pieces, yeah
i'm falling to pieces, yeah
i'm falling to pieces
 one still in love while the other one's leaving 
i'm falling to pieces
 'cause when a heart breaks no it don't break even 

oh, you got his heart and my heart and none of the pain
you took your suitcase, i took the blame
now i'm tryna make sense of what little remains, oh
'cause you left me with no love and no love to my name

i'm still alive but i'm barely breathing
just prayed to a god that i don't believe in
'cause i got time while she got freedom
'cause when a heart breaks no it don't break
no it don't break no it don't break even no

what am i gonna do when the best part of me was always you?
and what am i supposed to say when i'm all choked up that you're ok?
i'm falling to pieces, yeah
i'm falling to pieces, yeah
i'm falling to pieces
 one still in love while the other one's leaving 
i'm falling to pieces
 'cause when a heart breaks no it don't break even

oh, it don't break even, no
oh, it don't break even, no

my mother went away for a month long trip
her and some friends on an ocean liner ship
she made a big mistake by leaving me home
i had to roam so i picked up the phone
dialed ali up to see what was going down
told him i pick him up so we could drive around
took the dodge dart, a '74
my mother left a yard but i needed one more
shaheed had me covered with a hundred greenbacks
so we left brooklyn and we made big tracks
drove down the belt, got on the conduit
came to a toll, and paid and went through it
had no destination, we was on a quest
ali laid in the back so he can get rest
drove down the road for two days and a half
the sun had just risen on a dusty path
just then a figure had caught my eye
a man with a sombrero who was 4 feet high
i pulled over to ask where we was at
his index finger he tipped up his hat
el segundo, he said, my name is pedro
if you need directions, i'll tell you pronto
need a civilization, some sort of reservation
he said a mile south there's a fast food station
thanks, se or, as i started the motor
ali said "damn, tip, what did you drive so far for?"

well, describe to me what the wallet looks like

anyway a gas station we passed
we got gas and went on to get grub
it was a nice little pub in the middle of nowhere
anywhere would have been better
i ordered enchiladas and i ate em
ali had the fruit punch
when we finished we thought for ways to get back
i had a hunch
ali said: pay for lunch, so i did it
pulled out the wallet and i saw this wicked beautiful lady
she was a waitress there
put the wallet down and stared and stared
to put me back into reality, here's shaheed
"yo tip man, you got what you need?"
i checked for keys and started to step
and what do you know, my wallet i forget

it was a brown wallet, it had props numbers
it had my jimmy hats, i gotta get it man

lord, have mercy
the heat got hotter, ali starts to curse me
i feel bad but he makes me feel badder
chit chit chatter, car starts to scatter
breaking on out, we was northeast bound
jetting on down at the speed of sound
three days coming and three more going
we get back and there was no slack
490 madison, we're here, sha
he said, "all right, tip, see you tomorrow
thinking about the past week, the last week
hands go in my pocket, i can't speak
hopped in the car and torped' to the shack
of shaheed, we gotta go back
when he said "why?," i said "we gotta go
'cause i left my wallet in el segundo"

i left my wallet in el segundo
i left my wallet in el segundo
i left my wallet in el segundo
i got to get it, i got, got to get it
i left my wallet in el segundo
i left my wallet in el segundo
i left my wallet in el segundo
come on, let's go

come on, let's go

and i proceed to let you know, exactly how to flow
i'm not lawn doctor so just seckle with the hoe
oops...my mistake, i didn't know you went with her
should i run down the line of all the kids that done hit her?
don't be bitter, i hear that honey resembles a critter
heard she likes the two on one like my man john ritter
but back to the subject, you can't catch wreck
you must get respect, to earn respect
suckers think they could hurt me, 'cause now i wear specs
you're full of jokes, but yo, your name ain't flex
i got the riches, the bitches, i'm large like a huxtable
you think you're all that, but your girl's quite doable 
yeah, i'm tellin' you g, to back up off me

i'm the undercover brother, dump your hoe in the trunk
save all the sad songs and the tearjerkers
niggas step back, it's the lyrical worker
the poems that i create ain't in paperback books
the poems that i create are for hookers and the crooks
my mental is excelling 'cause i dabble in the books
i'm not the one to front on, so suboops suboops
yo, i gets the pickin's, i'm such a damn dickens
if you step to this then the plot just thickens
i'll run you around the track like a bunny and a dog
to me, your just another mc on the log
a link in the chain, fluid on the brain
i boast of hype lyrics, and yours are mundane
see, i can't maintain, especially if you come back
i'm the lyrical master blaster, yeah, i could do that
i could also do your girl, so leave the hoe at home
'cause when i get done, i'll have her strung on bones
it's the no joke pressure, that elevates my mind
make me pick up and go when it's time to drop my rhymes
my title is rock, the abstract poetic
i'm in the idle mode but my energy's kinetic
so smooth and debonair, special for the ear
gotta keep my thing in gear
'cause it's evident and clear that i will rock, rock, rock...

yup yup yup
to the north to the south to the east to the west
i don't discriminate boy i bring it to your chest
if you oppose, then your soul will decompose
strive to get money and i'm not no hoe
fresher than the air that you're breathing through your nose
iller than the kicks that you're puttin on your toes
you can ask bo but yo that nigga don't know
about the dominant factor, the accurate rapper
here's the next chapter, page ninety five
niggas so hard it's a wonder they alive
but yo we still survive through the danger that lurks
my eyes remain wide while you ass like urk
and yo my family matters, so all you mad hatters
put your thinking caps on and motherfuckin brainstorm
'cause i got the plan that wins and can't lose
your man knows who's nice, say tip, he'll say "true"
a lot of these jokers out here is blas 
i'll be rockin mikes until a horse says 'hey'
some are preoccupied with glamour and glitz
actin all bougie and making big movies
but i'll be in the cut, call me incognito
busy making joints that will bump for my people
you're listening to a man who was something from nothing
stay in me forever head, never be frontin'

once in a while we have fun in the mix
into good living but some be into glitz
everybody knew, all the fellas and the chicks
we gotta wear a shoe that fits
c'mon word, check it out now 
uh, uh, check it out now 
what? uh, check it out now 
 uh, check it out, yo

peace to the girl named hurricane g
peace to my girl named dawn paris
peace to the organized kon fus ion
peace to all my shorties who be dying too young
peace to both coasts and the land in between
peace to your man if you're doing your thing
peace to my peoples who is incarcerated
asalaam alaikum means peace, don't debate it
devouring, and towering over fools
your mic is broke and my shit's cool
the black man with the understanding of
the three wise men and the theories of zen
yo, i get inside the crevice like a dentist
disrupt, the block, like dennis, the menace
shaheed is on the needle, the shit it won't weeble
or wobble, your rhymes is mixed up like boggle
bingo  that was the damn dog's name
but yo i know another one with much more fame
the phife dawg, and that's my word to the cipher
about to bring it to your chest and 'cause strife, check it out
you're doubling back to your rhyming pad
what i represent is mc's gone mad
in a perfect world there's imperfect acts
we've come like a guide to redirect alla that
so people with a gift can just flaunt and get money
so much, we in the bank that the shit ain't funny
money is invested in real estate and stocks
but not inside the glamour 'cause all of that stops

yo, this the cons to the quence
up in ya like a stiff one, nah'mean?
it's nine five, you got to live it or rip it
so if you step on the streets keep it movin, nah'mean?


check my style out
life situations are the ones i speak about
it seems cats nowadays be gettin' introduced to courage
don't get discouraged 'cause my words are fluid like flourish
we got the bounty, we from the queens county
overlookin' things like a rushmore mounty
and got no other choice except to get a little love
we rise above, the beat be fittin' like a glove
the pain in my heart is getting dosed by joy
we have no other ploy but to bring the b boy
there's nothing on this earth that can instill fear
the locomotive, puttin' my thing in gear
i only have the fear of god and that's taqwa
you need binaca; your trap is blazing like blanka
i got the lethal, you couldn't put a match to it
let me know, yo, where we could do it like stuart
mind over matter, action is needed
when the big one not to be superseded
responsibility is somethin' i can't deny
the illegalties is the nonsense reply
most cats who scramble do so because they want to
but known to kick rhymes in the past on impromptu
my willy's hot like two links in the skillet
a room filled with speakers, one stage, watch me kill it
knowledge should be sought from the cradle to the grave
rhyming opposition get it twist like super dave
you be looking bug just like uncle jesse
don't make the scene messy
'cause it'll jump, that's word to aunt bessie
profound sentences of pure lyric gems
some of my friends be liking people with stems
folks be on the chase for this cheddar
thinkin' it makes your life better
but it can make you ass out
and when i'm at a show chicks never pass out
we got the joints to make the whole mash out out
a tribe called quest make the party go down
plus we bring positive vibes to fill up all your crowns
lyrics comes to cats like a hot and cold flash
some can come with ease, therefore, it's in a smash
held the fort down like the justice league hall of super friends
but in the world turmoil spins
brothers walk the street with the ill pace face
city life breeds contempt for each race
all praises due to allah and i should say it
it's the abstract motivator making things clear
puttin' things in perspective to rock and roll
'cause you know this kid has got wild soul
americana makes drama like starved out piranha
cold like ice, jet hot like a sauna
it's the haves verse the have not
and guess who's arrived in the hood
exposing all wrongs, it's all good
ayo, word up, hip hop is live like a wire
let's get a little bit before the whole joint expire
i got to stress it again, this here is for my kin
and all my babies, children of the world, no maybe's
so, yo, we gotta move through and push through
because we gotta make it happen, keep it true blue
it's like that
so much confusion goin' on
so much confusion goin' on
inside all mine
inside all mine
so much confusion goin' on
uh, uh, uh, uh
but everything will be fine
so much confusion goin' on
so much confusion goin' on
gotta make it alright
gotta make it alright
gotta elevate your mind
elevate your mind
elevate your mind
elevate your mind
elevate your mind
elevate your mind
elevate your mind


as we start trudging
me and my brothers we be looking and be bugging
vehicles of life they be rolling and be nudging
searching for the virgins of life
that be shoving out the door that's crack
the valleys of time, are always on my feet
as least the beat will combine
the calluses and corns with the funky bassline
you don't need underdog for a nickel shoeshine or the shoes that's phat
but can i get a level on the bass and on the treble?
footing up and down like a unlv rebel
the answer be amongst us 'cause we rarely dig acoustics
can't be too much flacking, not too much packing
you must container that at least to dip your hand in rap
your feet will be infectious so at least realize the fact
the rhythms are inserted and the nurse can be converted
this ain't rock 'n' roll 'cause the rap is in control
if you're a megastar, words will buy you a car
i'd rather go barefooting, for prints i will be putting
all over the earth if we can get there first
now that we are in it, footprints are being printed
so if you recognize 'em, you can try to size 'em
they'll probably be the ones with the size nine flying
all over the field, you won't have to yield
if you want protection you can hide behind the shield

and the musician often tries to capture the new thing so that we might have melody and have rhythm as we do our thing
it's rough and tough in this ghetto, a lot of funny stuff going down but you got to walk tall. walk tall 

you can game on the gallons if you really need to rock
but we walk while we talk as we stomping through the block
hand in hand 'cross the land as muhammad cross the fade
it's a tribe who meanders, precious like a jade
it's a art, theo arch rhymes the ground placed upon
the mind will unwind, it will soft to beyond
catch the track, track by track, get a map to track a trail
you will find yourself behind for a map does not prevail
see the levels peaking as the rhythms keep a screeching
a quest, oh yes a quest, inside the jam i will keep preaching
the point, oh yes the point, because it's close but yet so far
the liveliness is mean as we scoot across the star
we are bulging, i'm indulging in a rat a tat tat
explanation for the line is that the rhythm is phat
keep it wild, wide and deep, you could dig it in a jeep
but dig it in the ground because the footprint now

walk tall 

if there's a storm that's brewing, it won't keep us from doing
our thing as we start swinging, travelling is bringing
joy inside the domes as we hit the road to rome
a chair is not a chair, a house is not a home
because my skin is brown, yo i'm gonna do the town
rub it in the face and rub my feet all through the place
when you get your finger on the music it'll linger
sing a song o' sixpence, sing it like a singer
a nubian, a nubian, a proud one at that
remember me, the brother who said "black is black"
you can come while we quest, i don't play, i don't jest
get emotions off your chest, we are black, we been blessed
making moves, making motions, flowing like an ocean
the walking will continue, we know that we will bring you
the times that you have waited, more anticipated
be gone but not for long because the feet will stay strong


linden boulevard represent, represent sent
tribe called quest represent, represent sent
when the mic is in my hand, i'm never hesitant
my favorite jam back in the day was "eric b. for presi "

rude boy composer, step to me you're over
brothers wanna flex, you're not mad cobra
mc shorty black, there ain't no other
trini born lad like nia long's grandmother
tip and sha they all that, phife dawg ditto
honey tell your man to chill, or else you'll be a widow
did not you know that my styles are top dollar?
the five foot assassin knocking fleas off his collar
hip hop scholar since being knee high to a duck
the height of muggsy bogues, complexion of a hockey puck
you better ask somebody on how we flip the script
come to a tribe show and watch the three kids rip

queens is in the house represent, represent
a tribe called quest represent, represent
no taming of the style cause it gets irreverent
a tribe called quest represent, represent
huh huh, here we go, you know that i'm the rebel
throwing out the wicked like god did the devil
funky like your grandpa's drawers, don't test me
we in like that, you're dead like presley
when we coming through get tickets to see me
we work for the paper so there'll never be a freebie
lyrics are abundant cause we got it by the mass
egos are all idle cause the music is the task
valenzuela on the pitch, curveball, catch it
i think i got it locked, just smooth while i latch it
right, now i must move with the quickness
here comes shaheed so we must bear the witness

stir it up  stir it up  stir it up 
steve biko
stir it up  stir it up  stir it up 
steve biko

new york city represent, represent
a tribe called quest represent, represent
the dawg is scientific with the styles i invent
a tribe called quest represent, represent
mcs like to meddle, but here's my proposition
i let my lyrics flow, and juxt your whole position
i'm radical with this like the man this song is after
yo tip settle down, what's the reason for the laughter?
i really can't say, i guess i laugh to keep from crying
so much going on, people killing, people dying
but i won't dwell on that, i think i'll elevate my mental
thanks for these bars on the biko instrumental
yo i'll take it back, i'm the indian giver
mcs take notes as i stand and deliver
percussion isn't less, ds wear the vest
why they dodging bullets, you should be dodging quest
don't get me wrong, violence is not our forte
i just like to rhyme, kick the lyric skills like pel 
tip educate 'em, my rhymes are strictly taboo
fill 'em with some fantasies and i'll look out like tattoo

ok, i am recognizing that the voice inside my head
is urging me to be myself but never follow someone else
because opinions are like voices, we all have a different kind
so just clean out all of your ears, these are my views and you will find
that we revolutionize over the kick and the snare
the ghetto vocalist is on a state wide tear
soon to be the continent and then the freaking globe
there's room for it all as we mingle at the mall
we welcome competition cause it doesn't make one lazy or worn
we gotta work hard, you know the damn card
try to be the phattest is the level that we strive
try to be the phattest also to stay alive

ey die leute sehen mich heute live im tv
reich und beliebt, doch weißt du noch wie alles eigentlich verlief
ich mein weit vor dem hype, vor den rhymes und den suites
acker jeden tag und hab'n scheißdreck verdient
großstadt, jap ich war allein ohne ziel
mach' die nacht zum tag, der geistige krieg
zwischen rhymes die ich schrieb und bin eigentlich verliebt
lag im grunde nur die hoffnung, dass die eine es sieht
also scheiß auf musik, ich muss kohle verdienen
ich w rd ja auch viel lieber chillen wenn es ohne das ging
doch leider bezahlt man 'ne wohnung plus strom und benzin
nicht vom erwarten irgendwann das große los mal zu ziehen
sie sagen: "du musst los nach berlin "
ich hab nie erwartet, dass bei mir was großes geschieht
bei manchen war es koks oder weed
ich dagegen nahm in krisen halt die droge musik

und immer dann wenn es nach oben geht
schreib ich es hin denn so bleibt's in erinnerung
egal was passiert, ich greif nach papier
und schreib mir mein leben ins ged chtnis
und immer wenn ich dann am boden bin
weckt mich ein song wieder aus der erinnerung
l uft nicht so geschmiert, wirst motiviert
und merkst, dass das leben wieder fett ist

 yeah 
ey sorry, immer noch broke, keine kohle am start
h ng bei psaiko auf der couch, denn dort wohne ich grad
drehen die scheiße auf, wussten nicht wieso es so war
doch bauten dicke dinger wie'n silikonimplantat
noch immer ohne vertrag, noch immer ohne die charts
noch immer weit entfernt von irgend nem millionenbetrag
eher so dosen im park, eher so hosen am arsch
das erste mal wie sie mir sagt, dass sie mich ohne witz mag
warte, wo ist meine karte, wieder mal verpennt
im b ro außer atem,  hm, ja, ich wohn eigentlich grade
nicht bei mir zuhause doch ist bloß so ne phase
klingt nicht sch n wie die mondscheinsonate
eher so blamage, im schoss eine gabe
ich lege los, schreibe flows, bloß eine frage
der zeit, bis die scheiße sich lohnt z hl ich tage

und immer dann wenn es nach oben geht
schreib ich es hin denn so bleibt's in erinnerung
egal was passiert, ich greif nach papier
und schreib mir mein leben ins ged chtnis
und immer wenn ich dann am boden bin
weckt mich ein song wieder aus der erinnerung
l uft nicht so geschmiert, wirst motiviert
und merkst, dass das leben wieder fett ist

das große jahr und sie bemerken ich hab hits gemacht
sagten das ist richtig krass und was ich alles richtig mach
komm' doch mal vorbei und wir trinken was
zack, unterschrieben und der scheiß wurde fix gemacht
ich wusste nicht genau was ich damit jetzt mach
denn, dass es so wie heute wird, das h tt ich damals nicht gedacht
und irgendwann ergibt sich was, daddy fand es nicht so krass
denn ich schmiss die schule mit den worten "i don't give a fuck"
und von da an gab es tankstellenfraß
fahren durch das land, waren gefangen im spaß
und basti fragte, ob ich mich in' schrank stellen mag
ich sag klar, sag nur wann, ich bin ganz schnell am start
ey wir konnten es nicht ahnen, wie ein brandmelder gas
doch die h nde gingen hoch wie ein panzer im irak
und du merkst du bist oben wenn du ganz unten warst
also scheiß auf den rest, irgendwann kommt der tag, let's go

und immer dann wenn es nach oben geht
schreib ich es hin denn so bleibt's in erinnerung
egal was passiert, ich greif nach papier
und schreib mir mein leben ins ged chtnis
und immer wenn ich dann am boden bin
weckt mich ein song wieder aus der erinnerung
l uft nicht so geschmiert, wirst motiviert
und merkst, dass das leben wieder fett ist

meine zeit is' jetzt
egal was kommt, man, ich bleib' relaxt
ich lehn' mich zur ck, schreib 'n text
noch keinen plan wohin, doch bis jetzt war's fett, uh yeah

ich spring in die tight jeans, white tees, schl pf in die nikes
spike lees, bring' dich zur ck in die nineties "hi kids"
ich bin nicht verr ckt, doch'n hypebeast
like dies, like das, like alles, kein beef
kein g, kein weed, kein feat, mein beat  oh yeah 
fat banger, bitte mach die tracks l nger
doch ich mach, was ich will, außer das rezept  ndern
hmmm, schmeckt lecker, bin kein jetsetter
doch meine tracks geh'n um die welt   backpacker
und deine freundin heißt ecca
will ja nich' meckern, doch sie sitzt auf meinem sweater
und sie schluckt nach ihrem doppelwhopper nochmal locker
23 k he und'n halbes dutzend trecker
was so viel heißt, wie deine olle is' schweeer
in ordnung, denn man kann sie roll'n, wie das "r", yeah
meine chick ist scharf, wie das "s"
ja genau, sie ist scharf wie ein mex 
ikaner, lieblingsfilm, sie will mich wiederseh'n
doch ich brauch nicht viel im leben außer das "supreme emblem"
auf meinen snapbacks, decks oder backpacks
jede zeile ist fett und relaxt so wie jack black
ich denk zur ck als das rap ding begann
damals waren meine helden max, sam und jan
heute zieh ich selber mit den tracks  bers land
bin egal, wohin ich komm', schon bekannt   sing es 
  2x 

oh oh oh yeah, yippie yeah

haha, war'n witz, ich mein million r
und was ich damit meine? meine taschen sind   leer
ist okay, man, ich brauch' kein cash
brauch keine villa am meer und auch kein benz
brauch keine eigene band, brauch keine brand
alles, was ich von euch will, ist ein "oh yeah"
und du sagst "uuh, die beats sind tight"
also steckst sie in die pipe und ziehs sie rein
nimm dir 2 minuten zeit, atme kurz tief ein
und du merkst, du wirst high, willst mehr von dem scheiß
also lehn dich zur ck, mach das fenster auf
tape rein, aufdreh'n, g nsehaut
jap, denn ich hab', was ein gangster braucht
schreiben andere rapper texte, hab ich l ngst gebounced
  2x 



yeah, yeah, yeah
baby bitte komm und lass uns chillen
ich will heute weder aufstehen, noch will ich hier raus gehen
denn da draußen gibt es niemanden, der uns beide missen w rde
du und ich allein in deiner kleinen bude immer noch im bett und chillen
also komm baby geh nicht weg und bleib liegen
wenn ich sage du bist immer noch das allerbeste was mir je passiert ist, na dann ist das untertrieben
denn mit dir im bett ist die welt wieder wie perfekt
und kein plan wie das ohne dich ging denn so lange du hier bist will ich nie wieder weg
ja und ich weiß du willst das nicht h ren aber baby du bist wundersch n
manchmal w nsch ich mir du w rdest deine zeit in meinem kopf verbringen und die welt aus meinen augen sehen
du w rst das sch nste was du sehen w rdest
und wir machen ein paar dinge die man mama nicht erz hlen w rde
siehst mich an, machst das licht aus, ziehst mich an und ich dich aus
und ich bin so was von addicted, denn jedes mal wenn du mich mit  nem blick triffst
steht meine welt kurz still, es ist wie im film
bitte lass uns chillen

yeah, baby, mit dir bleibt die zeit stehen
es f hlt sich an als w r das hier f r
immer, immer, immer, immer, immer
yeah, baby, mit dir bleibt die zeit stehen
es f hlt sich an als w r das hier f r
immer, immer, immer, immer, immer

immer wo wir liegen
f hlt es sich so an, als w re ich federleicht und k nnte fliegen
wir sind weit, weit weg  ber wolke 7  tausend 
und wenn ich bock hab k nnte ich dir auf der stelle sofort  ber hundert dinge nennen wieso du das allerbeste dieser welt bist
w rdest du mir nicht immer den mund verbieten
und deshalb sag ich nichts, blind verstehen
doch das hat ne ganze weile lang gedauert weißt du manche dinge kann man halt als kind nicht sehen
so wie sterne am tag und immer wieder merk ich, wie selten ich sag, wie sehr ich dich mag
deine ehrliche art und es wird immer mehr seit dem ersten tag
und ja ich weiß, es ist nicht immer leicht und wir beide haben leider hin und wieder streit
es tut mir leid, bitte bleib, baby
denn dieser moment ist so perfekt ich lass dich nie wieder alleine
jeder von uns beiden weiß, das leben ist so schnell vorbei und deshalb lass uns doch so tun als h tten wir f r immer zeit doch irgendwann alles wieder so 

yeah, baby, mit dir bleibt die zeit stehen
es f hlt sich an als w r das hier f r
immer, immer, immer, immer, immer
yeah, baby, mit dir bleibt die zeit stehen
es f hlt sich an als w r das hier f r
immer, immer, immer, immer, immer

well, it's the m i crooked letter coming around the south
rolling straight hammers and vogues in that old southern slouch
please, ain't nothing but incense in my atmosphere
i'm bending corners in my 'lac, boi
'cause that's how we be rolling here
deep, the slang is in effect because it's georgia
kicking the khakis and adidas
packing yo' heaters 'cause you 'sposed to, cousin
catfish and grits is how my flow flows
rolling steady in that caddy but them 50 bottles got to go
see, juice and gin used to be my friend from the beginning
now i'm just a player sipping sauce every now and then
to catch a buzz like a bumble bee
niggas who tried to fuck with me
get sprayed like raid 'cause it ain't nothing to see

my heat is in the trunk along with that quad knock
no, my heart don't pump no kool aid
jump and you'll get too sprayed
who raise yo' block? the one and only outkast
many a nigga falling fast and i continue blasting, swiftly
they ain't gon' get me, got something fo' em
the devil up in yo' grill and you still don't even know em
show 'em who's the ok
like collard greens and hoecakes, i got soul
that's something that you ain't got
that's why your style is rot ten
stop in the land of atl
where nothing but pimps fully equipped quick to make a sale
swell, swollen got my pockets, business booming like rockets
folks try to stop it but they know that it's that

it's that southernplayalisticadillac funky music
now, players if you choose it
you better make sure you don't abuse it
we gonna get cha high, high

time to drop these 'bows like dusty rhodes
then i yell "ho," and knock 'em up off they feet
like a southern hustler supposed to do
i's in the house like... a joint is lit for my kinfolks
and all the niggas that was down since we been broke
taking 'em deeper than a submarine
so scream when you hear the team of two
look, my crew be thick as two fat hoes sitting off in a brougham
i'm packing my tag backwards if you want to be acting wrong
word is bond like super glue, it's funky like poopa scoop
and every word i say you can true

well, okey dokey, 'kast out
i swear to god i got the highest booming cadillac
the expialalistic coupe de ville, can you handle that, you rat?
i take my time cruising 'round the city malls
and under my seat for you suckers is your final curtain call
the one two to the gauge, p u m p
you want to do a jack, i heat the barrel 'til it's empty, get me?
see, i ain't finlay, getting in where i fit
organized is on the track with the southernplayalistic shit
so copy my slang and bite my shit but don't try gaffling me
'cause sleeping you'll get served with some southern hospitality

it's that southernplayalisticadillac funky music
now, players if you choose it
you better make sure you don't abuse it
we gonna get cha high, high

well, southernplayalisticadillac music has been laid
i may wait for all day and day, be rolling like that today, hoe
so back up off it, get up on it if you want it, ya'll
looking for hoes and snitches was my thing on player's ball, yup
so now i step, rather walk with the pimp limp
while my niggas are at east point with that college park hemp
smoked out is how i wanna end it on this track
so i pass it to my partner and step back up in my cadillac

step up in my shoes, you crews sitting on trues
and vogues for the hoes only when we rolling through
atlanta skies be blue, the sun is beaming, it's seeming
that i'm glistening, rather gleaming
20 20 got me leaning to the side, full of pride
now ain't that something?
i'm dipping into your hood, this ain't braille, but i'm bumping
thumping out the roaches, dungeon if y'all missed it
big gipp, goodie mob, pa, outkast, southernplayalistic

it's that southernplayalisticadillac funky music
now, players if you choose it
you better make sure you don't abuse it
we gonna get cha high, high
it's that southernplayalisticadillac funky music
now, players if you choose it
you better make sure you don't abuse it
we gonna get cha high, high
it's that southernplayalisticadillac funky music
now, players if you choose it
you better make sure you don't abuse it
we gonna get cha high, high

ey yo, mum, es tut mir leid  ich hab' versprochen, nicht zu rasen
doch du weißt doch, wie ich bin, ich lass' zu oft die leute warten
deshalb wollt' ich mich beeil'n, dass ich zum kochen wieder da bin
und jetzt starr' ich auf 'ne eiche in 'nem geschoss von einem wagen

vollmond, sieben euro
drei homies und 'ne flasche billigwodka aufm volvo
'n ganz normaler abend mit den boys und
was damals so banal war, ist auf einmal von bedeutung
privatjet, hier oben ist es leise
die bande feiert wild meine millionen und die preise
menschen werden tiere wegen drogen, bitches, scheine
ich war mittendrin daneben, aber irgendwie alleine
seychell'n, sie rennt ins meer   t rkise well'n
ich mach' 'n foto, das sch nste der welt
sieh' ihre haare auf dem moped ohne helm
und die feuerrote sonne kracht in slomo in die well'n
alles flick, wir bleiben silvester in paris
und dein l cheln brannte sich in mein ged chtnis, als du schliefst
und ich versprech' mir, ich vergess' dich wirklich nie
hab' genug von randombitches und den n chten in berlin

ich bin da, ich sehe sie klar
meine geburt und mama l chelt unter tr n'n, h lt mich fest   oh mein gott, ist mir warm 
hab' endlich 'n zahn
vier kinder grinsen um die wette, jede vhs kassette voller herrlichem kram
daddy, guck her  ich kann fahr'n
und m dchen find' ich  tzend, doch ich lande mit sechzehn mit jessy im bett
und versprech', sie zu retten, doch brech' ihr stattdessen nach etlichen heftigen n chten
direkt vor dem essen ihr herz   ich hoff', es schmeckt

der mercedes ist schick, athletischer schnitt
so b se, aber edel und schlicht
und jeder sitz wildleder bestickt
ich fass' ihn an, schließ' die augen und fahr' gegen den strich
und ja, mann, ich erinner' mich noch good
damals schon im rover wie gewinner durch die hood
ich bin auf der r ckbank, alle stoned von dem kush
es ist sommer und der bass dr ckt durch den bauch in die brust
ich hab'  bertrieben lust und f hle, dass es muss
fick auf alle andern, mann, die l gen wie gedruckt
die h lfte meiner jugend nur in z gen und im bus
war am  ben, doch ich wollte nie auf b hn'n   das ist stuss
die zeit verging so schnell, wohin mit all dem geld?
f nf sterne hotels, unvern nftig bestellt
und ich hab' st ndig nur rekorde gebrochen
und gottverdammte scheiße, ich bin in den orbit geschossen

ich kann geh'n, ich hab' alles geseh'n
denn ich hab' all die motherfucker, die mich immer wieder stoppen wollten
einfach versenkt, einfach versenkt
hab' mich verloren in den dingen, die mir wichtig sind
und deshalb war ich immer zu sp t, war immer zu sp t
und nein, ich hab' nicht so getan als w r' mir alles scheißegal
verdammt, ich hab' es gelebt, ich hab' mich gelebt
und wenn das hier die letzte nachricht von mir w r'
dann w rd' ich sagen, ich hab's vor euch geseh'n

mef candyman: farewell to the flesh
death come in the scripture, 2001

when you walk up in this dead zone, with all that wack shit
now you know you dead wrong, one thousand lashes

detonate that, pussy massengil rap cleanse that
the kids rank, snatch collars off while riding off
float boat big boys, oakland a's stashed away blades
ventilation let the sharks animaze

or might shot me a pussy protesting
coming with that lip professing, you must take allah for fool
where's his jewel? was he using mathematics as a tool?
tell me, the struggle is god and i came to build
shit is so real, inside you distilled
back in the form of mist, you wishing you did the knowledge
before speaking, seeking, where you went wrong
and why would i bring you such physical harm?

mind arson, my squadron surround the soundgarden
guns for hire plus you under fire and a target
sniper in the cypher, i pied piper
move the housing by the thousand, i watched out the chrysler
bombs strike ya like the mighty thor, blast the door
recite a page like a tidal wave crash the shore
two pulls, i'm wild like mechanical bulls
pack a full house, it's girls night out, pull a handful
heavenly laced, stimulation make it feel slow paced
i motivate and await my sober state

magnificent, heavenly the god stay bent
five percent, range whipping, soul controller of the lynch
macking phone rings, stephen king drama down at danzine
my mood swings, suplexed off the rope, magazine
coconut juice, walnut colored shoe, ninth annual
moses lost his sandal hiding the manual
blowing evangel bugging off of bon jovi hits
grandma lowvey, famous murder weapon was a trophy
seeds posing in osh kosh, guzzle grolsch
sabotage massage rap bandit at large
wolverine carnation milk, wu denim jeans
thurston howell the third, kid's back on the scene
call it chopped meat cause every word is choppy
malachi crunch all crows to death, kobayashi couldn't stop me
getting caught up in my world, h agen dazs swirl

blazing that ted rossi up in the marquees
he lost like a hundred ounces, jake rushed his houses
had him on the porch, ass no trousers

same kid crying on the stand with judge kuffner
kissed him with odd numbers three to nine style
before he left he flashing his face like denzel
richard dale took his beaver, un threw up all in his whip
mussy dropped and split his wig with the heater
his shape up was all fucked up, heze had me laughing
god you see how he was laid out in the grass
with dirt in his mouth, slim woke him up told him he wild out
blood leaking from his teeth he smiled like he gummed out
big bolo, stacking his shit, financed a volvo
he copped his shit from a small coffee shop in soho
he still pussy, he sell his dust up on the lower east
posing like he rapping out...


yo; this goes for all my brothers and sisters locked down
for all my peoples incarcerated, for those who ain't make it

yo, in the housing, thousands seen early graves
victims of worldly ways, memories stays engraved
all my live brothers, is locked down with high numbers
the young hunger, blind to these lies, they die younger
in this new world the order slaughter men, women, and children
ten feet gates surround the building keep us sealed in
the projects, lifeless like a vietnam vet
constant war, sever threats of enemy conquest
crooked cops comb my building complex that's in the rumble
streets are like a jungle, can't let my cypher crumble
vivid thoughts, devils resort to trick knowledge
they kick garbage, lust for chicks and quick dollars
i know the pain the game bring, i did the same thing
spaced out in the staircase, performing a sting
it's hard to keep control, i bless those who seek a scroll
trying to reach a whole nation and break the sleeper hold
not a role model, i walk a hard road to follow
i sold bottles of sorrow then chose poems and novels
the gospel was told, some souls it swallowed whole
mentally they fold, and they eventually sold
their life and times, deadly like the virus design
but too minute to dilute, the scientist mind

you can't party your life away, drink your life away
smoke your life away, fuck your life away
dream your life away, scheme your life away
'cause your seeds grow up the same way

a voice cries from the wilderness of the north
a representation of the families that lost one
all victims of incarceration
or other divisions of the family structure
youths are injected with serums that leads
to skin irritations, babies being born with
disfigurations, experimentations
on their faces there bear worry ations
of mothers that carry the pain
of blood stained streets where sisters mourn and wail
fifth brothers been slain from hails of gun fire
it lightly begins to rain screams of terror
are hidden by the passing trains
this can't be little hussein, his uncle cries
as he drops to his nephew's side, holding his cane
just give me a name, of who has inflicted this
bitter sickness, and left us to witness

yeah, yo; curses from war, innocent blood spills for days
soothe in godly ways, hands, solemn in praise
tree of life, more precious than rubies, golden game
the wise shall flourish inherit, halls of fame
crime visions in my blood got me, locked in prison
while we die hard living people whine about religion, vision
blow, spin, and sin and killing what's revealing
it's a never ending battle with no ending or beginning, listen
zero process, progress, become the hunted
america's most wanted, good life flaunted, want it
some love the speed, some satisfy a need
some want to be down, young gun seed, jungle breed
the strong must feed, someone die, someone bleed
one flew astray, and it caught my little seed
can it be, the ice savage, trife life, made me grab the knife
the righteous man was beat with many stripes, pipes
take in my energy, breath and know the rest
'cause the good die young and the hard die best

you can't party your life away, drink your life away
smoke your life away, fuck your life away
dream your life away, scheme your life away
'cause your seeds grow up the same way
'cause your seeds grow up the same way
'cause your seeds grow up the same way

y'all bitches love dances, and pulling down your pants
while your man's on tour, your spending up his advances
your friends ain't shit, all they do is drink, smoke, and suck dick
the whole projects is trapped in six
you either high school drop outs, one to three cop outs
fifteen years old, shorty ass and top out
ninety nine cent beer drinking pussy stinking
fucking so much your ass and titties start shrinking
new world order slave trade, minimum wage, medicaid
can a devil fool a muslim nowadays
inside my lab, i'm going mad
took two drags off the blunts, and started breaking down the flag
the blue is for the crips, the red is for the bloods
the white's for the cops, and the stars come from the clubs
or the slugs that ignites through the night, by the dawn
early light, why is sons fighting for the stripe

as we dwell through this concrete hell, calling it home
mama say, take your time young man and build your own
don't wind up like your old dad
still searching for them glory days he never had
so many bad want to scheme for american dream, no more kings
the cash rule everything now, we going down
these babies looking up to us, it's up to us
the million man march mc's, get on the bus
but envy, greed, lust, and hate, separate
though the devil mind state blood kin cannot relate
no longer, brothers, we unstable
like kane when he slew abel, killing each other

you can't party your life away, drink your life away
smoke your life away, fuck your life away
dream your life away, scheme your life away
'cause your seeds grow up the same way
'cause your seeds grow up the same way
'cause your seeds grow up the same way


feelings. the emotional side of a man, woman or a child's character. a response or tendency to respond. a belief, which can be vague, illogical, but mostly, irrational

i never gave a fuck on how the next nigga felt

you never know, how when i first came out, how my brothers felt
i've been going through it, plus a lot of deep pain was felt
we would last for a night, but a better tomorrow

i felt the angel of death breathe
when i felt the four fifths something told me squeeze
i felt like it was the end of a dynasty
like i was fighting a clique of five chinese thieves
karate slippers with slip on's so i kept slippin'
the floor was too smooth felt like i couldn't catch a grip in
felt like dragonfly jones, was dragonfly tone
so i kept spitting, woke up when i heard the phone

i never gave a what on how the next rapper felt
i take that rapper's belt myself, i feel how cappa felt
i don't really need help, use a sharpie, don't need the felt
marker, walk on water, i see how jesus felt
no rhyme or reason, just bleeding, my every breathing's felt
this about a thesis that even paraplegics felt
these boys ain't needing, they barely breathing, believe it, seen it
till you got cheated, you couldn't tell me how cheating felt
i'm not a failure, i couldn't tell ya how losing felt
might not have nailed her, but i can tell ya how spooning felt
remember when you first heard the rap and the way it felt
i burned the track with a murder rap and i know it's felt

a workshop where skills are learned
handcrafted and drafted, written works the main concern

and a curious culture full of superconductors

intricate geometric raps on a larger screen

i sip the dom p, watchin' gandhi 'til i'm charged, then
writin' in my book of rhymes, all the words past the margin
behold the mic i'm throbbin', mechanical movement
understandable smooth shit that murderers move with
the thief's theme, play me at night, they won't act right
the fiend of hip hop has got me stuck like a crack pipe
the mind activation, react like i'm facin'
time like pappy mason, with pens i'm embracin'
wipe the sweat off my dome, spit the phlegm on the streets
suede timbs on my feet makes my cipher complete
whether cruisin' in a six cab or montero jeep
i can't call it, the beats make me fallin' asleep
i keep fallin', but never fallin' six feet deep
i'm out for presidents to represent me  say what? 
i'm out for presidents to represent me  say what?

i trip, we box up crazy bitches
aimin' guns in all my baby pictures
beef with housing police, release scriptures that's maybe hitler's
yet i'm the mild, money gettin' style, rollin' foul
the versatile, honey stickin', wild, golden child
dwellin' in the rotten apple, you get tackled
or caught by the devil's lasso, shit is a hassle
there's no days for broke days
we sell it, smoke pays, while all the old folks pray
to jesús, soakin' their sins in trays of holy water
odds against nas are slaughter
thinkin' a word best describin' my life to name my daughter
my strength, my son, the star will be my resurrection
born in correction, all the wrong shit i did
he'll lead a right direction
how you livin'? large, a broker charge, cards are mediocre
you flippin' coke or playin' spit, spades, and strip poker?

break it down
it's yours, it's yours
it's yours, it's yours

i'm the young city bandit, hold myself down single handed
for murder raps, i kick my thoughts alone, get remanded
born alone, die alone, no crew to keep my crown or throne
i'm deep by sound alone, caved inside, 1,000 miles from home
i need a new nigga for this black cloud to follow
 cause while it's over me it's too dark to see tomorrow
tryin' to maintain, i flip, fill the clip to the tip
picturin' my peeps not eatin' can make my heartbeat skip
and i'm amped up, they locked the champ up
even my brain's in handcuffs
headed for indiana, stabbin' women like the phantom
the crew is lampin', big willie style
check the chip toothed smile, plus i profile wild
stash loot in fly clothes, burnin' dollars to light my stoge
walk the blocks with a bop, checkin' dames
plus the games people play bust the problems of the world today

 it's yours 
it's mine, it's mine, it's mine whose world is this?
the world is yours, the world is yours

anarchists put a flame to a tire, walk around with the fire round necks
mankind gotta deal with a new kind of mind i'm a quick death wrapped in a threat
tell these fuzzy little weak heart bunny babies back up or get wet
never mind where you draw the line, i got a mind for crime, it's all disrespect
i'm a oil rig fire in the flesh, you're a lunchbox walking erect
tasty treats from the lungs to the flesh of the neck
who's hungry? the table's set, come get it
pain is a game then you better run with it, have fun with it, enjoy your suffering
kernel panic, terminal rushin'
empty the clip while your clip's still bufferin'

look in the eye of the violent and villainous
we are the murderous militants
we are the pirates that hide on the island invade or we wilding
marauding and murdering merchantmen
we have been cursed by the curs
we shooting first on our turf
pay us our proper respect
you pray for your god to end the perverse
he sent the worst of the worst
every death demon disperse
we put them all in a hearse
we put them under the earth
we are the savages ravaging hell
death in the air, we relish the smell
we are the hand of the lord
we are the hand with the sword
taking the heads of the faith
we are the sealers of fate
we are the fangs of the snake

let's go 
huh?

the enemies of the state

it's free now, go to the light
me and mike bring d'lite to the knife fight
get twenty nine grand sliced

might light twenty nine grand up in a night
tongue lash slash in defiance
born to brawl boy, the bastard alliance
hardy harr, you a laugh, i'm a riot
that's not a brag, that's science 

back from the bellows of hell
back from the back of a jail in the cell
back from the gun and the priest to the con and the creed
back to the streets from the east
back to the belly of beast
back to the place of my peace
back to me holding my piece
anything working disturbing that peace
will certainly meet the deceased, capiche?
oh, why must i tell 'em again?
what must i tell 'em, my friend?
that we are born into sin
and we are worshiping murderers
nothing but evil duplicitous men

the ambulance, they coming baby, just breathe
that's what the old lady said when she screamed
this nightmare on elm street, friday the 13th
and in the 13th amendment, it don't say that we kings
they say that we legally slaves if we go to the bing
they told kaep' stand up if you wanna play for a team

back in the days when i was a teenager
before i had status and before i had a pager
you could find the abstract listenin' to hip hop
my pops used to say, it reminded him of bebop
i said, "well, daddy, don't you know that things go in cycles?
way that bobby brown is just amping like michael"
it's all expected, things are for the lookin'
if you got the money, quest is for the bookin'
come on everybody, let's get with the fly mode
still got room on the truckload of black boom
listen to the rhymes, then get a mental picture
of this black man, and black woman fixture
why do i say that? 'cause i gotta speak the truth, man
doin' what we feel for the music is the proof, and
planted on the ground, the act is so together
bona fide strong, you need leverage to sever
the unit, yes, the unit, yes, the unit called the jazz is
delivering each year an lp filled with street goods
you can find it on your rack in your record store
if you get the record, say your thoughts are adored
and appreciated, 'cause we're ever so glad we made it
we work hard, so we gotta thank god
dishin' out the plastic, do the dance till you're spastic
if you diss it gets drastic
listen to the rhyme, 'cause it's time to make gravy
if it moves your booty, then shake, shake it, baby
all the way to africa, a.k.a. the motherland
stick out the left, then i'll ask for the other hand
that's the right hand, black man
only if you are noted as my man
if i get the credit, then i think i deserve it
if you fake moves, don't fix your mouth to word it
get in the zone of positivity, not negativity
'cause we gotta strive for longevity
if you botch up, what's in that 
 what?  a pair of nikes, size ten and a half

we gotta make moves  words 
never, ever, ever could we fake moves  come on, come on 
we gotta make moves  words 
never, ever, ever could we fake moves  come on, come on 
we gotta make moves
never, ever, ever could we fake moves  come on, come on 
we gotta make moves
never, ever, ever could we fake moves  come on, come on 

"time, time is a ship on a merciless sea
drifting toward an abyss of nothingness
until it can be recharted for its own destiny
time is an inanimate object paying and paying and paying for no justification for belief
time is dancing, boogalooing away all memories of past "

we gotta be a winner all the time
can't fall prey to a hip hop crime
with the dope raps and dope tracks we move blocks
from the fly girlies to the hardest of the rocks
musically the quest, is on the rise
we on these excursions so you must realize
that continually, i pop my zulu 
if you don't like it, get off the zulu tip
so what can you do in the times which exist
you can't fake moves on your brother or your sis
but if your sis is a , brother is a jerk
leave 'em both alone and continue with your work
whatever it may be in today's society
everything is fair, least that's how it seems to me
you must be honest and true to the next
don't be phony and expect one not to flex
especially if you rhyme, you have to live by the pen
your man is your man, then treat him like your friend
all it is, is the code of the streets
so listen to the knowledge being dropped over beats
beats that are hard, beats that are funky
they could get you hooked like a crackhead junkie
what you gotta do is know the tribe is in the sphere
the abstract poet, prominent like shakespeare
 or edgar allan poe, or langston hughes, or... 

we gotta make moves
never, ever, ever could we fake moves  come on, come on 
we gotta make moves
never, ever, ever could we fake moves  come on, come on 
we gotta make moves
never, ever, ever could we fake moves  come on, come on 
we gotta make moves
never, ever, ever could we fake moves  come on, come on 

" time is running out on black power advocates in the day and white thighed supporters at night
every time you see them, they're chasin' some white woman with their tongue hangin' out
time is running and passing, passing and running, running and passing, passing and running "

i know i can get through the fall

'cause life must go on  go, go on 
one blink, then it's all gone
i said life must go on  go, go on 
even when you know it's all wrong
whether you're high, whether you're low
gotta keep on, be a part of the show
i said life must go on  go, go on 
go on, and you know i got you

in my mind, in the chemistry that i combine sits
a melody that's singing, "you're not fine"
but they can't hear me out
so i'm in a rapid conversation
to know if this is any normal sensation
the internet's saying i'm temptatious
and they can't hear me shout

and yeah, i know my world's burning down
where to run? who to call?
even though my world's burning down
i know i can get through the fall

'cause life must go on  go, go on 
one blink, then it's all gone
i said life must go on  go, go on 
even when you know it's all wrong
whether you're high, whether you're low
gotta keep on, be a part of the show
i said life must go on  go, go on 
go on, and you know i got you

everything keeps on changing and i'm caught in the middle
i just keep getting anxious, yeah, i'm caught in the middle
trouble turning these pages, yeah, i'm caught in the middle

'cause life must go on
one blink, then it's all gone
i said life must go on
even when you know it's all wrong
whether you're high, whether you're low
gotta keep on, be a part of the show
i said life must go on  yeah 
go on, and you know i got you
life must go on  life goes on 
one blink, then it's all gone  all gone 
i said life must go on  go on 
even when you know it's all wrong
so whether you're high, whether you're low
gotta keep on, be a part of the show
i said life must go on  life goes on 
go on, and you know i got you

whether you're high, whether you're low
gotta keep on, be a part of the show
i said life must go on
go on, and you know i got you

i used to think
i had the answers to everything
but now i know
life doesn't always go my way, yeah
feels like i'm caught in the middle
that's when i realized

i'm not a girl
not yet a woman
all i need is time
a moment that is mine
while i'm in between

i'm not a girl
there is no need to protect me
it's time that i
learn to face up to this on my own
i've seen so much more than you know now
so don't tell me to shut my eyes

i'm not a girl  not a girl, not yet a woman 
not yet a woman
 i'm just trying to find the woman in me 
all i need is time
a moment that is mine
while i'm in between

i'm not a girl
but if you look at me closely
you will see it in my eyes
this girl will always find her way

i'm not a girl
i'm not a girl, don't tell me what to believe
not yet a woman
i'm just trying to find the woman in me, yeah
 all i need is time  all i need is time
a moment that is mine
while i'm in between
i'm not a girl  not a girl, not yet a woman 
not yet a woman
 i'm just trying to find the woman in me 
not now
all i need is time
a moment that is mine
while i'm in between
i'm not a girl
not yet a woman


"never look back," we said
how was i to know i'd miss you so?
loneliness up ahead, emptiness behind
where do i go?
and you didn't hear
all my joy through my tears
all my hopes through my fears
did you know still i miss you somehow?

from the bottom of my broken heart
there's just a thing or two i'd like you to know
you were my first love, you were my true love
from the first kisses to the very last rose
from the bottom of my broken heart
even though time may find me somebody new
you were my real love
i never knew love 'til there was you
from the bottom of my broken heart

"baby," i said, "please stay
give our love a chance for one more day"
we could've worked things out
taking time is what love's all about
but you put a dart
through my dreams, through my heart
and i'm back where i started again
never thought it would end

from the bottom of my broken heart  my broken heart 
there's just a thing or two i'd like you to know
you were my first love, you were my true love
from the first kisses to the very last rose
from the bottom of my broken heart
even though time may find me somebody new
you were my real love
i never knew love 'til there was you
from the bottom of my broken heart

you promised yourself
but to somebody else
and you made it so perfectly clear
still i wish you were here

from the bottom of my broken heart
there's just a thing or two i'd like you to know
you were my first love, you were my true love
from the first kisses to the very last rose
from the bottom of my broken heart
even though time may find me somebody new
 you were my real love  you were my real love
i never knew love 'til there was you
from the bottom of my broken heart

"never look back," we said
how was i to know i'd miss you so?

die lyrics des video edits gibt es hier.

das leben macht spaß, ja, du bist 'n star, yeah
isst von goldenen l ffeln und fickst sch ne frau'n
zehntausend km h, doch du gibst noch gas
und brauchst nie wieder schlaf, denn du lebst den traum
doch wozu girls, cash, pretty things
'n wundersch nen benz in weiß?
und all der ganze fancy scheiß?
du stehst vor hunderttausend fans und weißt:
irgendwann ist der moment vorbei
und ich wollt' eigentlich unendlichkeit

scheiß auf money, scheiß auf bitches und karrierescheiß
ich wurde nicht weil ich gut ficke bei den apes gesignt
scheiß auf platin und das business, denn es geht vorbei
keine zeit, das hier ist mein ticket in die ewigkeit
und wenn es gut l uft, hab' ich siebzig jahre lebenszeit
um zu verhindern, dass die seele kilometerweit
schwerelos ins leere treibt, bitte gott, steh mir bei
dass am ende dieses lebens mehr als 'ne troph e bleibt
yeah, yeah, ich weiß, wir hab'n zu wenig zeit
doch um was zu reißen, glaub mir, reichen ein paar megabyte
es ist schon sp t, ich weiß, sorry, doch mir fehlt 'n reim
geh schon mal voraus und richte aus, es komm'n 'n haufen
neuer dinge, nach den'n alle sich erinnern, wer ich war
damals mit der mpc vom zimmer in die charts
ich bin mir sicher, man kann nur gewinnen, wenn man wagt
die welt ist nicht genug, ich halt' den finger richtung mars

das leben macht spaß, ja, du bist 'n star, yeah
isst von goldenen l ffeln und fickst sch ne frau'n
zehntausend km h, doch du gibst noch gas
und brauchst nie wieder schlaf, denn du lebst den traum
doch wozu girls, cash, pretty things
'n wundersch nen benz in weiß?
und all der ganze fancy scheiß?
du stehst vor hunderttausend fans und weißt:
irgendwann ist der moment vorbei
und ich wollt' eigentlich unendlichkeit

i remember this for life
and now i see much clearer
i'm not scared to die
'cause i will live forever
i will be alive
in this moment
for eternity
for eternity

so schnell wie alles kam ist es irgendwann vorbei
und deshalb leb' ich jeden tag als g b' es nur noch ein'n, eh
das leben ist nicht lang, es ist irgendwann vorbei
und deshalb streb' ich jeden tag nach unendlichkeit



ey yo, ich hab' so das gef hl dieser tag heut wird dope
reiß alle fenster raus und dann dreh die mucke auf
leg die fernbedienung weg, leb den film so wie ich
denn mein nachbar h rt jetzt rap ob er will oder nicht
ey, ich f hl' mich so fly,  so fly , so fly
denn ich f hl' mich so fly
wenn ich rhyme bin ich weit, weit weg
von dem streit, jedem stress, ganz allein, bleib relaxt
bin mein eigener chef, dieses life ist perfekt

und immer wenn die angst mich verfolgt
und die zweifel mich fast wieder kill'n
weil ich nicht weiß was passiert
ich will schreien, aber bleib lieber still
und wenn die zeit nicht vergeht, weil es einfach nicht l uft wie man will
doch dann kommt diese melodie, dieses lied
ich war nie so verliebt, war noch nie so verliebt, war noch nie so verliebt

und alles beginnt sich zu dreh'n
und alles beginnt sich zu dreh'n
und alles beginnt sich zu dreh'n
und alles beginnt sich zu dreh'n
und alles beginnt sich zu dreh'n

ist schon klar, manchmal ist es hart
doch ich sitz nicht zuhaus' und denk' den ganzen tag nur nach
wenn leute sagen, rapp' mal wieder so wie vor 'nem jahr
damals warst du noch mein star   ist mir sowas von egal
black on black   versace dress, der deutsche kanye west
nur nicht ganz so arrogant, bin eher so sympathisch nett
große bilder   art attack, der typ der auf sich warten l sst
doch komm ich auf die party, dann halt besser deine barbie fest

und immer wenn die angst mich verfolgt
und die zweifel mich fast wieder kill'n
weil ich nicht weiß was passiert
ich will schreien, aber bleib lieber still
und wenn die zeit nicht vergeht, weil es einfach nicht l uft wie man will
doch dann kommt diese melodie, dieses lied
ich war nie so verliebt, war noch nie so verliebt, war noch nie so verliebt

und alles beginnt sich zu dreh'n
und alles beginnt sich zu dreh'n
und alles beginnt sich zu dreh'n
und alles beginnt sich zu dreh'n
und alles beginnt sich zu dreh'n
und alles beginnt sich zu dreh'n
und alles beginnt sich zu dreh'n
und alles beginnt sich zu dreh'n
und alles beginnt sich zu dreh'n
und alles beginnt sich zu dreh'n
und alles beginnt sich zu dreh'n

„schick dich  schick dich  
„ich schick' dich selber, mann  
„alle sind schon da  
„ja, perfekt, ich bin auch gleich da  
„du hast gar keine ahnung   als du vorhin weg warst, ich schw r' dir   carlo? 

da ist 'n baum   berleg'  
lass mich raus    zu sp t  
es ist aus, es ist aus 
hab' applaus, du idiot
du wirst seh'n, ich geh' drauf wegen mir
nun gut, mach's schnell, ich hoff', es tut nicht weh
ich hab' angst, oje   verdammt, tut es weh?
schon vorbei? ne  doch ey, ich hab' gelebt, yeah 

ich hab' gelebt, ich war auf dem planet
hatte vieles zu erz hlen, ist ein riesen privileg
und jetzt? jetzt sterb' ich, werd' irgendwo beerdigt
und komm' sicher in die h lle, denn ich war nicht immer ehrlich
ey yo, mum, es tut mir leid  ich hab' versprochen, nicht zu rasen
doch du weißt doch, wie ich bin, ich lass' zu oft die leute warten
deshalb wollt' ich mich beeil'n, dass ich zum kochen wieder da bin
und jetzt starr' ich auf 'ne eiche in 'nem geschoss von einem wagen

vollmond, sieben euro
drei homies und 'ne flasche billigwodka aufm volvo
'n ganz normaler abend mit den boys und
was damals so banal war, ist auf einmal von bedeutung
privatjet, hier oben ist es leise
die bande feiert wild meine millionen und die preise
menschen werden tiere wegen drogen, bitches, scheine
ich war mittendrin daneben, aber irgendwie alleine
seychell'n, sie rennt ins meer   t rkise well'n
ich mach' 'n foto, das sch nste der welt
sieh' ihre haare auf dem moped ohne helm
und die feuerrote sonne kracht in slomo in die well'n
alles flick, wir bleiben silvester in paris
und dein l cheln brannte sich in mein ged chtnis, als du schliefst
und ich versprech' mir, ich vergess' dich wirklich nie
hab' genug von randombitches und den n chten in berlin

ich bin da, ich sehe sie klar
meine geburt und mama l chelt unter tr n'n, h lt mich fest   oh mein gott, ist mir warm 
hab' endlich 'n zahn
vier kinder grinsen um die wette, jede vhs kassette voller herrlichem kram
daddy, guck her  ich kann fahr'n
und m dchen find' ich  tzend, doch ich lande mit sechzehn mit jessy im bett
und versprech', sie zu retten, doch brech' ihr stattdessen nach etlichen heftigen n chten
direkt vor dem essen ihr herz   ich hoff', es schmeckt

der mercedes ist schick, athletischer schnitt
so b se, aber edel und schlicht
und jeder sitz wildleder bestickt
ich fass' ihn an, schließ' die augen und fahr' gegen den strich
und ja, mann, ich erinner' mich noch good
damals schon im rover wie gewinner durch die hood
ich bin auf der r ckbank, alle stoned von dem kush
es ist sommer und der bass dr ckt durch den bauch in die brust
ich hab'  bertrieben lust und f hle, dass es muss
fick auf alle andern, mann, die l gen wie gedruckt
die h lfte meiner jugend nur in z gen und im bus
war am  ben, doch ich wollte nie auf b hn'n   das ist stuss
die zeit verging so schnell, wohin mit all dem geld?
f nf sterne hotels, unvern nftig bestellt
und ich hab' st ndig nur rekorde gebrochen
und gottverdammte scheiße, ich bin in den orbit geschossen

ich kann geh'n, ich hab' alles geseh'n
denn ich hab' all die motherfucker, die mich immer wieder stoppen wollten
einfach versenkt, einfach versenkt
hab' mich verloren in den dingen, die mir wichtig sind
und deshalb war ich immer zu sp t, war immer zu sp t
und nein, ich hab' nicht so getan als w r' mir alles scheißegal
verdammt, ich hab' es gelebt, ich hab' mich gelebt
und wenn das hier die letzte nachricht von mir w r'
dann w rd' ich sagen, ich hab's vor euch geseh'n


baby, i know, darkness is everything
and i'm feelin' so alone
baby, i know your love but i would never know you ou
but i'm feelin' so alone
why you gotta lie to feel like you're so?
and in my head there's talking, alone

'cause the leaves are brown
the leaves are brown
the leaves are brown
the leaves are brown

send me a sign, send me a sign
baby, i know, time must change everything
and i'm feelin' so hollow, hollow
baby, i know, here am i
why don't you think that i'm the one?
the way you've got a lot to love, that's my 
but in my head 

'cause the leaves are brown
the leaves are brown
the leaves are brown
the leaves are brown
the leaves are brown
the leaves are brown
the leaves are brown
the leaves are brown


this shit right here for my oodles o' noodles babies
his ma  smoked the crack while she was pregnant so he can't even help that he crazy
he goin' to jail, it s inevitable, forreal

i ain't have nobody to give me no hope
i hope my momma ain't doin' no coke
i used to wish that my daddy was livin'
i had a dream that i seen him as ghost
i used to act up when i went to school
thought it was cool, but i really was hurt
wanted my family to come to my games
my mama couldn't make it 'cause she was at work
lived with my grandma, she took me to church
really no i ain't wanna go
remember i kissed my aunt in the casket
and her forehead was cold
i was like 4 years old
we couldn t afford no clothes
it was hand me down
who would think a nigga get a grammy now?
got a black judge tryna tear me down
all this jail time probably wear me down
turn the lights off in the bathroom
screaming, "bloody, bloody, bloody mary" now
havin  nightmares about candyman
with the tool on me like a handyman
killed my lil' cousin, i m like, "damn it, man"
had to see the footage on a camera, man
on the pavement, with his brains out
with the white sheet, he was laid out
wanna ask 'ye, "is this a choice?"
it was like this when i came out
what the fuck is you really complaining 'bout?
i know niggas that's never gon  make it out
this that shit you won't see in the media
poor get poorer and the rich gettin' greedier
lot of daddies goin' back and forth out of jail
lot of sons growin' up and repeating them
this the belly of the beast, you won't make it out
man, this shit was designed just to eat us up
and my momma told, "nigga, keep it up
you gon' end up in prison, just sweepin' up"
remember, nobody never believed in us
when they see us now, they can't believe it's us, no

i think it's funny how
we used to go to school, play sega's
and then, next thing you know, you runnin' 'round with glock .40s
we ain't never believed in the police, they was shootin' us

yeah, they called it the projects, they put us in projects
what they gon' do with us? can't call the cops yet
you might just get popped at
'cause they the ones shootin' us
i'm on my mom's steps, it's like a bomb threat
the violence pursuing us, i ain't meet god yet
'cause i'm on the block where
it's just me and lucifer, look what they do to us
they know we in poverty
when i went to court, the judge said, "meek, you a menace to society"
huh, you said, you would give me a chance, your honor, why would you lie to me?
16 more years of probation, you know you gon' get some more time on me, huh
whole hood goin' crazy, babies havin' babies
she was fourteen, actin' like she eighty
got pregnant by a nigga that was locked up in them cages
and the story goes on, if you make it, you amazing  word up 

see, i got homie that's a billionaire
and i be tryin' to explain it to him like
if your mom ain't on crack or if she got a job and she doing eight hours a day
and your daddy in the graveyard or in the jail cell, who the fuck gon' babysit?



i know i can
be what i wanna be
if i work hard at it
i'll be where i wanna be
i know i can  i know i can  
be what i wanna be  be what i wanna be  
if i work hard at it  if i work hard it  
i'll be where i wanna be  i'll be where i wanna be  

be, b boys and girls, listen up
you can be anything in the world, in god we trust
an architect, doctor, maybe an actress
but nothing comes easy, it takes much practice
like, i met a woman who's becoming a star
she was very beautiful, leaving people in awe
singing songs, lena horne, but the younger version
hung with the wrong person, got her strung on that heroin
cocaine, sniffing up drugs, all in her nose
could've died, so young, now looks ugly and old
no fun 'cause when she reaches for hugs, people hold their breath
'cause she smells of corrosion and death
watch the company you keep and the crowd you bring
'cause they came to do drugs and you came to sing
so if you gonna be the best, i'ma tell you how
put your hands in the air, and take the vow

i know i can  i know i can  
be what i wanna be  be what i wanna be  
if i work hard at it  if i work hard it  
i'll be where i wanna be  i'll be where i wanna be  
i know i can  i know i can  
be what i wanna be  be what i wanna be  
if i work hard at it  if i work hard it  
i'll be where i wanna be  i'll be where i wanna be  

be, b boys and girls, listen again
this is for grown looking girls who's only 10
the ones who watch videos and do what they see
as cute as can be, up in the club with fake id
careful, 'fore you meet a man with hiv
you can host the tv like oprah winfrey
whatever you decide, be careful, some men be
rapists, so act your age, don't pretend to be
older than you are, give yourself time to grow
you thinking he can give you wealth, but so
young boys, you can use a lot of help, you know
you thinking life's all about smoking weed and ice
you don't wanna be my age and can't read and write
begging different women for a place to sleep at night
smart boys turn to men and do whatever they wish
if you believe you can achieve, then say it like this

i know i can  i know i can  
be what i wanna be  be what i wanna be  
if i work hard at it  if i work hard it  
i'll be where i wanna be  i'll be where i wanna be  
now, go 
i know i can  i know i can  
be what i wanna be  be what i wanna be  
if i work hard at it  if i work hard it  
i'll be where i wanna be  i'll be where i wanna be  

be, be fore we came to this country
we were kings and queens, never porch monkeys
there was empires in africa called kush
timbuktu, where every race came to get books
to learn from black teachers who taught greeks and romans
asian arabs and gave them gold, when
gold was converted to money it all changed
money then became empowerment for europeans
the persian military invaded
they heard about the gold, the teachings, and everything sacred
africa was almost robbed naked
slavery was money, so they began making slave ships
egypt was the place that alexander the great went
he was so shocked at the mountains with black faces
shot up they nose to impose what basically
still goes on today, you see?
if the truth is told, the youth can grow
they learn to survive until they gain control
nobody says you have to be gangstas, hoes
read more, learn more, change the globe
ghetto children, do your thing
hold your head up, little man, you're a king
young princess when you get your wedding ring
your man is saying "she's my queen"

i know i can  i know i can  
be what i wanna be  be what i wanna be  
if i work hard at it  if i work hard it  
i'll be where i wanna be  i'll be where i wanna be  
i know i can  i know i can  
be what i wanna be  be what i wanna be  
if i work hard at it  if i work hard it  
i'll be where i wanna be  i'll be where i wanna be  

save the music, y'all
save the music, y'all
save the music, y'all

sippin' on tequilla sun rise with the lime in
i'm gettin' high, but it's lowerin' my eye lids
still see you niggas, i don't know just what the hype is

ayo, ayo, ayo, high potency thai, smoke a bag of black
and feel the vibe, born to be wise, we form on a rise
the corner mean five, horns in disguise, throw on your slides
young niggas racist, smokers is basing
we seen the eyes laying up, playing the cut, what?
stay in the truck, something told me duck, folded me up
my shoulders struck out of luck, fucked the pradas up
fell in a daze like a golotta snuff, niggas tried to body me up
i'm in the lobby bleeding, niggas in the waiting office probably eating
and sprinting and beefing when they heard the shots called the precinct
and seen barber nieces beast, some niggas shot shallah features
and shot through his ellesses, bent the spinal cordless creatures
i'm gagging and flagging a cab down
guess who in the benz wagon, dragging my sound down macking
it was dale breedy the greedy, conniving ass snake genie
cop with a bikini who murdered tosh and benini
i'm feeling wheezy and i'm drained from the cheeba grieving
ain't even looking decent, seeing police niggas reaching

that splash against my hollow bones
that rocks my...

fleeing the crime scene speeding
beefing leaving behind cream, not even peeping that i was leaking
won't see the precinct just got a recent case beaten
still jakes are creeping, don't blow your spot, stay the weekend
keep the ruger peeling who's squealing few knew the dealings
keep the steel concealed in cause we got no time for feelings
eyes on the building guards are on the corners illing
million dollar block villain plotting on a killing
feel like, a superhero talking like a true deniro
they boost his ego found him broke down, reduced to zero
cops fill reports hoping i'll reveal my source, source

that splash against my hollow bones
that rocks my soul

outside the check cashing, flashing, dipped in fashion
five cherry faced faggots tried to cash in
they keep laughing   ghost, you'll get your face bashed in
who gave you these privileges son? why you maxing?
and we... fiending to take those
move slow, i'm hearing how you broke rob's nose
and i heard you keep a banging hammer, golden brass
diamonds embroideries that was stolen that you haven't reported, g
make very little noise, my shit hiccup
don't make this big stick up bigger, me and the boys
i thought for a second, then chose rather than froze
had the gem star in my hand... yo, what the fuck?
yo, that's when i ripped timothy, snatched and dipped
jumped right in back of him, had the mini axe tool, faxed him
shots rang off, bing boggle de dum


the sword it's the best weapon of all
two sharp edges, and a long spine
the blade is very thin and it's easily damaged
you remember that: the vital thing is the point
pay special attention to it, your life could depend on it


i ain't trying to be no d boy, i love music, i'm a b boy
are you the undercover or the decoy
i'm heavy with the d, trouble t roy
a pit with no muzzle about to bust your bubble like a keloid
too much marijuana got me p noid
i'm killing instrumentals with that all so simple can it be, boy
shout to lil cease, b.i.g., boy
and funk doctor spock, i mean redman that's not leonard nimoy
88 keys on the keyboard

or washed up like sonny black's body on the seashore
that's a problem, i could be yours
a monster without the mad scientist and igor
i've heard it before, a third of these boys
got murder raps and never even murdered before

leave a bunch of dead niggas, don't forget to mention me
the angel of rap, the un ordinary light
already did what i was gonna do before you even got the mic

we left a large solar cloud distinguished by size
interaction with the wise and civilized
the mind caused matter to fall into a center
a great deal of heat that'll radiate within ya
from out of this collision
the central cord became thick enough to trap its own light and bring vision
each drop full of hip hop energy
balanced on all sides such great symmetry
the bars unlocked the power of the stars
the mirror in the telescope pinpoint the gods
from a distance, acting as a guiding coach
analyze the board, universal approach
retune the soul to a certain pitch
changing the frequency frequently, hitting a certain switch
the love is paramount, the connect is brotherly
respect for the intellect and broad discovery

keep watch, lights out when the beat drop
keeping the streets locked
i'm calling all g's from each block, from each block
keep watch, lame niggas out there can kick rocks
run these streets out here don't need cops
i'm calling all g's from each block, from each block

they're very trick so you must be very careful

and if he wasn't good buddha would not try to help him
"hey you have a pass from the..."

a game of chess is like a swordfight:
you must think first before you move
toad style is immensely strong
and immune to nearly any weapon
when it's properly used it's almost invincible

raw i'ma give it to ya, with no trivia

homicide's illegal and death is the penalty
what justifies the homicide, when he dies in his own iniquity?
it's the master of the mantis rapture comin' at ya

looks like the work of a master
evidence indicates that his stature
merciless like a terrorist hard to capture
the flow changes like a chameleon
plays like a friend and stabs you like a dagger
this technique attacks the immune system
disguised like a lie, paralyzin' the victim
you scream as it enters your bloodstream
erupts your brain from the pain these thoughts contain
movin' on a nigga with the speed of a centipede
and injure any motherfuckin' contender

the more i pull you in, the more that you get loose
we're playing games, but i can never win with you
every spark has an ending like a burning fuse
i'm on the edge
the more that i try to confess, the more our feelings collide
and all your dreams will fade until nothing is left
if you keep looking behind
you drain my heart, then you fill it up
you keep cutting me short, and you always put a pressure
on my triggerfinger
you keep pulling my chain in a hurricane
i try breaking away, but is sinking to the pressure
and i sense you're an ember
we're on a road, heading nowhere as we're steering blind
we're on our own, with each other racing side by side
nowhere to go, but i am heading to the end of time
we'll never know where we're going
never know if it's right
i'm on the edge
the more that i try to confess, the more our feelings collide
and all your dreams will fade until nothing is left
if you keep looking behind
you drain my heart, then you fill it up
you keep cutting me short, and you always put a pressure
on my triggerfinger
you keep pulling my chain in a hurricane
i try breaking away, but is sinking to the pressure
and i sense you're an ember
you keep pulling my chain in a hurricane
i try breaking away, but is sinking to the pressure
and i sense you're an ember

here in 1992 we present
the fabulous what's the scenario remix
whereas there are seven mc's
six which are in physical form, one which is in spiritual essence
and he goes by the name of, uh... hood 

check the vibe, walk that ass or get got
f it  shit  i lick buckshots
hood, madman, i rip up stages
lay down your wages, i'm wild like larry davis
extra, extra, pick up a clip
i'll tear ass out the frame  ha   and grab my dick  ohh  
i'm a rock'em sock'em robot kid, i drop bombs
i'm rugged and deadly, so i shit on the petty
i baseball bat a bastard, i'm bad news
i'm crazy and clever, cut throats of crews
death on the phono, my skills are porno
you say "oh no," you bitch ass homo
i bag up waste, electrifyin', i'm prime time
i slaughter a slime, i'm the greatest of all time
sick ass brother, nasty ass nigga
pump slugs in your face, and dump that ass in the river
two tears in a bucket, fuck it, kick the can
 say what, say what?  i'm a bad, bad man

quick is how i flip from the tip of the lip
punchin' out hits like gladys knight and the pips
the five foot assassin has just raided your area
your booty rhymes are wack and that's the reason i ain't hearin ya
 so   roll out the red carpet 'cause i'm kickin' this
vanilla ice platinum? that shit's ridiculous
excuse my french, but profanity is all i knew
and to you other sellouts, oh yeah, f you too
and let it be known, i'm not the one to step to
you're better off calling d nice to your rescue
freestyle fanatic, probably the best around
as for corny mcs, like chuck d, i shut 'em down
the artical don of hip hop and i won't stop
the five foot assassin has come to wreck 'nuff shop
so do like michael jackson and "remember the time"  do you remember? 
put on your dancin' shoes or somethin 'cause you sure can't rhyme

 big up, big up   enter new identity
next to say something 'cause you pass it to me
what does it take to check a technique?
 many styles, many styles  
hostile heat, brings bursts of energy
milo in de dance is the new identity
one two mic check, select for the ruffneck sect
ten to one that i come  correct  
in my cyphers on blocks, i bring box to connect with knots
so i can grow dreadlocks
maintain the rock  don't stop the rock 
maintain the rock  don't stop the rock 
kicking right inna your what's it not
i could rock longer but fair is fair
so c. brown are we in the clear?  yeahhh  
c. brown are we in the clear?  yeahhh  

makin moves y'all  moves y'all   on and on and on
 check it, check it out    to the break of, break of dawn
 who's that?   just one of the l.o.n.s
and a tribe called quest  east coast  to west
remix mad kick, more than metallica
to all mcs fall like the battlestar galactica
stampin', stompin', rompin' compton
 people all over the world   i'm promptin  style  
pick a style, any style, strong isle
representation, sensationalization
"scenario" for the radio, 'bls and kiss, so
 here we go yo   yeah
force, main source lp on the rise
in living color let's see through original eyes
and i'm out like shout, ooh ahh, ooh ahh
 ooh ahh, ooh ahh   there it is baby pah

flying in on a limb, slim trim, d i am
there i am  there i am   don't run from a grim
sight we be right, be polite for my mics
like i'm like  see sick, see syke 
and slip away, and off to the poconos
spot picked the clothes, hype swing the pretty pose
yamaha  ay ha may  
let's flip the funk, now it all spells  hey  
enough enough, ms. fitted i'm with it
if i did it, i was blitted, and probably shouldn't have quit it
cause yo, my vocal status at knight's like the gladys
bed rest, spread test, and yo i'm like the maddest
male, not female, hail from uniondale
bounce the b ball cause beats are being yelled
in the hallways always ringing with a  ho  
this is my two times nine on the scenario

check it out everybody, rhymes and mics
black mens gettin' loot  doin' what they like  
eight black brothers in the public eye
if you listen very close, i will tell you why
 hood   phife, milo, dinco and c. brown
shaheed, myself, and busta bust down
will commence to rock  rock   so bring on the flocks  flock  
in terrogation for the knockin of the box
the boom box ruler, controls the medulla
none come cooler, i win like shula
so bust out the moves as you start to pursue her
intensified mind, non blunt consumer
tip will come booty  well it's only a rumor  
the meanin' so deep that it starts brain tumors  tumors  
peace to hood baby from the midnight crooner
smoke 'em up later, if not then sooner

hey what we gon' do  dooo  in '92
even though we had fun  fuuun  in '91
wonderful my days, herb dream comin' down
ponna ponna new sound, leavin' cracks in the ground
what's goin on my man?  goddamn   and now my brain is hurtin'
listen up, busta, rhythm will hit 'em then i get 'em
flip on 'em, shit on 'em, hit on 'em, then i will sit on 'em
open up your mouth if you want the food
to get rude, flipmode, 'cause i'm in the mood
ah heh, ah heh  yeah man, that's how it goes
body drippin with blood comin out your nose
give me a band aid, what are you asking for?
 more   only your sacred and pure
adverse, zig zag, check it and the busta new rap
rap, busta rhymes, or bust this wicked rhymes
yeah y'all in '92, i'm packin my roach spray  anyway  
take a lick, tribe called quest, leaders of the new school
mad brother when stealthy
rrraaaow rraow rraow 
to my dragon, baby, stop whinin'
i see my influence still shinin'
more crazy in '92, uh oh, time to go, yo
that's the scenario 


let me flaunt the style, i think that the time's near
that we drop scuds, there won't be no duds here
rappers play the dumb, kinda on the space tip
but when they hear the jams, they be on the dilsnick
now i'm not for the rock, i know the territory
go ahead and try, that's a different story
similar to grimm, i could tell a better one
all about a kid, who couldn't rap and didn't run
stands on the side when the mic is getting dumb
resorts to bagging billy, asking could he have some
no never ever, go back and try again man
if you come back, i'll be the first to shake your hand
competition's good, it brings out the vital parts
the abstract poetic, majors in recital arts
do it for the kids, the elders and the rap peers
we know the job is done when we hear a lot of cheers
gotta feel the vibes, real from my creation
if the hands clap i'm filled with elation
here i am ghetto, full with a lot of steam
think i gotta, i think i gotta, i think i gotta scream
cause that's how good it feels child
let your hair down, so we can get buckwild
do your ill dance, don't think about the next man
we must have unity and think of the bigger plan
division we will fall, we must stick together, see
i'd like to take this time to say what's up to kool g
the name is q tip, the midnight marauder
giving nuff respects to afrika bambaataa
as a man in the world, i must do my job
take care of mama duke, i won't resort to rob
bob you'll get your dough, mase is my witness
obsessed with the rap, for it's the mental fitness
like shooting cee lo, and always hitting head cracks
the industry is luck, winning with the fake raps
peace to the crews who pump the real hip hop
not selling out, from hardrock to disc jock

i don't know what to say, but here i go freak it
if the papes come, then you know i'll seek it
i'm just a short brother, dark skin face
weigh a buck fifty, 36 waist
hair is crazy curly, flip like mr. furley
to this day i still believe that no mc can serve me
brothers try to front, but everybody know
i get more props than the arsenio hall show
party animal i was, but now i chill at home
all i do is write rhymes, eat, drink, shit, and bone
found my thrill in amityville, i'm always in the island
fudge and lucky know the time, they know who keeps 'em smiling
go out on my own, something that i gotta do
do what the hell i want and have no one to listen to
i'm prompt with my business and i do things on the double
yo, i'm out like buster douglas, i say peace to mc trouble
rest in peace

word up, rest in peace, and you know what else?
we got, we got, we got the vibes
all the people in long island, we got the vibes
brooklyn and queens, we got the vibes
uptown and now rule, we got the vibes
people upstate, we got the vibes
if you're in dc, you got the vibes
maryland, virginia, carolina vibes
out west, we got the vibes
in the bahamas, we got the vibes
over in europe, you know what, we got the vibes
and we gotta keep it alive, it goes um...

of rap i'm a fan, i've seen a whole lot of slums
good with the girls, i get a whole lot of 'em
from fat to skinny, freda to winnie
emma to cindy, constance to wendy
cause i be real friendly, never on the snotty side
i don't brag to brothers about the little papes i got
my vocal styles can vary, the sight is never scary
it's only legendary, my father well prepared me
my job ain't temporary, i'm here for the long shot
better yet the long term, i don't have a perm
in a way i do, call 'em the perma naps
i'm crazy slap happy and i'm scrappy and i'm nappy
when i get the mic in my hand with the crowd in the stands
it's as good as grand like that

yo, i wanna say peace and dedicate this joint to mc trouble
and to uh... trouble t roy
and to um... scott la rock
and to um... cowboy, you know what i'm sayin?
this is for the slain rappers and the fallen rappers, you know what i'm saying?
this is a special, special, special, special, special dedication
and also to my pops and also to vinia's moms, you know what i'm saying?
you just gotta keep it happy and keep the vibes going
cause this is vibes and stuff, and we out...

no disrespect, but mami, that's correct 'cause
what's in them jeans just got my mind hectic
i can see that you're feeling my fashion

way too reckless? or is it this necklace?

jeder anfang endet irgendwann
doch irgendwann kam viel zu schnell
viel zu viel zusammen
dass man langsam nicht mehr kann
f r immer ist noch ganz sch n lang
ich glaub, das war s, leb wohl, bis dann
doch irgendwas kommt ganz bestimmt
also schau mich bitte nicht so an
du bist nicht mehr interessant
aber h ngst noch immer an der wand
die zeit mit dir war sch n
doch uns bleibt nur die erinnerung daran
und manchmal w nsch ich mir, wir zwei
h tten uns sp ter erst gesehen
doch ich will nur, dass du weißt:

du bist und bleibst 
f r immer ein teil von mir
du bist und bleibst 
f r immer ein teil von mir

wir haben uns lang nicht mehr gesehen
und jeder geht seinen weg allein
andere kommen und gehen mir durch den kopf
doch es geht vorbei
dir geht es gut   rufst nicht mehr an
denn ich bin nicht mehr interessant
ihr zwei geht hand in hand
doch verdammt, wieso st rt mich was daran?
ich lenk mich ab und denk nicht nach
verdammt, ich frag mich was du machst
und was du an ihm hast
ich ruf dich an, und du sagst:
manchmal w nsch ich mir, wir zwei
h tten uns sp ter erst gesehen
doch ich will nur dass du weißt:

du bist und bleibst 
f r immer ein teil von mir
du bist und bleibst 
f r immer ein teil von mir

nein, ich bin im club und tanz' den lena meyer landrut
und mutti meint, ich soll die schule beenden
und an to do listen denken, und nicht die jugend verschwenden
jaja, ich weiß, dass nichts auf dieser welt f r immer bleibt
doch zum gl ck ist noch 'ne ganze menge zeit, bis sich

unsre welt nicht mehr dreht, die sonne nicht mehr scheint
gibt es kein'n grund zu wein'n, nein
denn wir war'n hier
wir war'n hier

und das ist mehr wert als der reinste diamant
nimm den meißel in die hand und schreib' es in die wand
schreib, „wir war'n hier, wir war'n hier
wir war'n hier, ganz egal, ob sich morgen   

unsre welt nicht mehr dreht, die sonne nicht mehr scheint

freedom or jail, clips inserted, a baby's bein' born
same time my man is murdered; the beginning and end
as far as rap go, it's only natural, i explain
my plateau, and also what defines my name

yeah, long live the idols, may they never be your rivals
'pac was like jesus, nas wrote the bible
now what you 'bout to hear is a tale of glory and sin
no i.d. my mentor, now let the story begin

i used to print out nas' raps and tape 'em up on my wall
my niggas thought they was words, but it was pictures i saw
and since i wanted to draw, i used to read them in awe
then he dropped stillmatic, rocked the cleanest velour
fast forward, who'd a thought that i would meet him on tour
i'm earnin' stripes now, a nigga got adidas galore
backstage i shook his hand, let 'em know that he's the man
when he said he was a fan it was too hard to understand
no time to soak up the moment though  cause i was in a jam
hov askin' where's the record that the radio could play
and i was strikin' out for months, 9th inning, feelin' fear
jeter under pressure, made the biggest hit of my career
but at first, that wasn't clear, niggas had no idea
dion called me when it dropped, sounded sad but sincere
told me nas heard your single and he hate that shit
said, "you the one, yo, why you make that shit?"

i can't believe i let nas down
damn, my heart sunk to my stomach
i can't believe i let nas down
i got defensive on the phone
resentment was in my tone, fuck it

long live the idols, may they never be your rivals
'pac was like jesus, nas wrote the bible
now what you're 'bout to hear's a tale of glory and sin
no i.d. my mentor, now let the story begin

i couldn't help but think that maybe i had made a mistake
i mean, you made "you owe me"
dog, i thought that you could relate
but while i shot up the charts
you mean tellin' me that i was not up to par
when i followed my heart
granted, my heart was tainted
by my mind that kept on sayin'
"where's the hits?" you ain't got none
you know jay'll never put your album out without none
and, dog, you know how come
labels are archaic, formulaic with they outcome
they don't know, they just study the charts
me, i studied the shows, the fans, study they hearts
i had a feelin' i was killin', and this music we were spillin' out
would change lives forever, fuck the label, put it out
friday night lights blew, that was classic number two
now it seemed as if the nas comparisons was comin' true
still no release date from the label, are they insane?
gucc told me play the game to change the game

but on the way i let nas down
i got no one to blame
i'm ashamed, i let nas down
but this is god's plan, you can never understand, fuck it

long live the idols, may they never be your rivals
'pac was like jesus, nas wrote the bible
now what you're 'bout to hear's a tale of glory and sin
no i.d. my mentor, now let the story begin

i always believed in the bigger picture
if i could get them niggas to listen outside my core
then i can open the door
reintroduce them to honesty, show 'em that they need more
the difference between the pretenders and the kendrick lamars
and so, i took the fall
like the son of the lord on the cross
dyin' for that fake shit you niggas bought
for the past decade
if i should pass, please let this be my last essay
therefore i write from the heart
apologies to og's for sacrificin' my art
but i'm here for a greater purpose
i knew right from the start
i'm just a man of the people, not above but equal
and for the greater good i walk amongst the evil
don't cry, mama, this the life i choose myself
just pray along the way that i don't lose myself
this is for the nigga that said that hip hop was dead
i went to hell to resurrect it
how could you fail to respect it?

letting nas down, i got the phone call
quietly i mourned, dog, i let nas down
yeah, and on this flight
may i never lose sight, fuck it

long live the idols, may they never be your rivals
'pac was like jesus, nas wrote the bible
now what you just heard's a tale of glory and sin
no i.d. my mentor, now let the story begin


uh, uh, uh, uh
uh, uh, uh, check the rhyme

back in the days on the boulevard of linden
we used to kick routines and the presence was fittin'
it was i, the abstract
 and me, the five footer 
 i kicks the mad style so step off the frankfurter 
yo, phife, you remember that routine
that we used to make spiffy like mr. clean?
 um... um... a tidbit, um... a smidgen

tell your mother, tell your father, send a telegram
i'm like an energizer 'cause, you see, i last long
my crew is never ever wack because we stand strong
now if you say my style is wack that's where you're dead wrong
i slayed that buddy in el segundo then push it along
you'd be a fool to reply that phife is not the man
'cause you know and i know that you know who i am
a special shout of peace goes out to all my pals, you see
and a middle finger goes for all you punk mc's
'cause i love it when you wack mc's despise me
they get vexed, i roll next, can't none contest me
i'm just a fly mc who's five foot three and very brave
on top remaining, no home training 'cause i misbehave
i come correct in full effect have all my hoes in check
and before i get the butt, the jim must be erect
you see, my aura's positive i don't promote no junk
see, i'm far from a bully and i ain't a punk
extremity in rhythm, yeah that's what you heard
so just clean out your ears and just check the word

we used to kick routines and the presence was fittin'
it was i, the phifer  and me, the abstract 
 the rhymes were so rumpin' that the brothers rode the 'zack 
ayo tip, do you recall when we used to rock  what? 
those fly routines on your cousin's block?
 um, let me see, damn i can't remember 
 i receive the message and you will play the sender 
you on point tip?  all the time, phife 
you on point tip?  yeah, all the time, phife 
you on point tip?  yo, all the time, phife 
so play the resurrector and give the dead some life

okay, if knowledge is the key then just show me the lock
got the scrawny legs but i move just like lou brock
with speed, i'm agile plus i'm worth your while
one hundred percent intelligent black child
my optic presentation sizzles the retina
how far must you go to gain respect? umm...
well, it's kind of simple, just remain your own
or you'll be crazy, sad and alone
industry rule number four thousand and eighty;
record company people are shady
so kids watch your back 'cause i think they smoke crack
i don't doubt it, look at how they act
well off to better things like a hip hop forum
pass me the rock and i'll score 'em with decorum
and proper what you say hammer? proper
rap is not pop, if you call it that then stop

bonita applebum  go 'head with yourself 
bonita applebum  hey hon, hey hon 
bonita, bonita, bonita, bonita, bonita, come on

bonita applebum, remember way back woo
when you used to play your knickers and your pigtail 'do
i used to be all on it like a fly to shit
back in the days, bonita was a hit
i flirted and i flirted 'til there was no end
but you kicked the diabolical and said we was friends
honey, you was funny but i'm tired of that
it's three years later, i got a new rap
got a little older, a titbit wiser
i gained twenty pounds, six inches higher
speaking of high i saw you smoke a hootie mack
your ex boyfriend claims he gets the booty back
but i'm here to testify it'll be a hard try
slapping my knees, letting out sighs
want to keep it slamming like a hip hop song
bonita applebum, you gotta put me on

bonita applebum  hey hon, hey hon 
bonita applebum  go 'head with yourself 
bonita applebum  hey hon, hey hon 
bonita applebum, you gotta put me on
i said bonita applebum  hey hon, hey hon 
bonita applebum  go 'head with yourself 
bonita applebum  hey hon, hey hon 
bonita, bonita, bonita, bonita, bonita
in the words of the immortal sweet daddy  uh 

i'll never shed a tear but then again i won't steer
you wrong, i steer you strong, for affection steer here
i'll take you to a place that's farther than the uno
what do you know, if we go to el segundo
your presence should be closer like on "buddy" i'll toast
to the ever clever youth, to say the least, you're the most
honey, you're my honey, a yo, dip, you're my dip
treasure and forever there'll be pleasure with tip
as we glide and move
cushioned like a pillow that's soft and smooth
ricky d said we got to "show and prove"
do it to the music, that's the raw butt groove
intimidate the boy
cupid that's his name
picking all us suckers is his flipping game
but tip don't fall for that
instead i'll get the natives and we rush to the latest
lambskin store, get a six pack of hats for

bonita applebum  hey hon, hey hon 
bonita applebum  go 'head with yourself 
bonita applebum  hey hon, hey hon 
bonita applebum, i said you gotta put me on
i said bonita applebum  hey hon, hey hon 
bonita applebum  go 'head with yourself 
bonita applebum  hey hon, hey hon

we can get down, we can we can get down  repeat x8 
it's like that man, it's like that  yes    repeat x4 
check it 

i'm not your average mc with the joe schmoe flow
if you don't know me by now, you'll never know
stepping on my critics, beating on my foes
the plan is to stay focused, only then i can grow
straight from the heart, i represent hip hop
i be three albums deep, but i don't wanna go pop
too many candy rappers seem to be at the top
too much candy is no good, so now i'm closing the shop
crushing competition like italians on grapes
my rhymes styles be blending like a ron g tape
my man where ya going, you can't escape
when the tribe is in the house that means nobody is safe
how can a reverend preach, when a rev can't define
the music of our youth from 1979
we rap by what we see, meaning reality
from people busting caps and like mandela being free
not every mc be with the negativity
we have a slew of rappers pushing positivity
hip hop will never die yo, it's all about the rap
so mayor barry smoking crack, let's preach about that
the trash you talk won't matter, that old bogus chatter
the more that you condemn us, it only makes us phatter
when i talk, i know i'm talking for hip hoppers all around
you know you love the sound, we gets down


i'm the cherry on the top of yo ice cream
i'm the mystic thought inside your dream
listen to the way we pulsate the jam
i'm the nigga here with the mic in hand
styles that we present are just a few
to do away with you and your hum drum crew
this is '93 and the shit is real
black people unite and put down your steel
ladies make a forum on your sexual drive
devote it to your lover and make it thrive
the rhythm's in f, i'm a hip hop body
release my energy with the force of a shotty
standing on the wall with my polo on
talking to the girl with the liz claiborne
keep the poetry in my black knapsack
got my timbo hooves and my doublemint pack
hit the city streets to enhance my soul
i can kick a rhyme over ill drum rolls
with a kick, snare, kicks and high hat
skilled in the trade of that old boom bap
i can do a trick with the opposite breed
i used to down 40s and smoke grade weed
now, i'm doing shows with half loot down
now it's time for me to take ya uptown
it's like that man, it's like that  yes    7x 
it's like this, shaheed 
shaheed: scratching  until end 
rakim: "why waste time on the microphone"

a tribe called quest consists of four members:
phife dawg, ali shaheed muhammad, q tip, and jarobi
a e i o u and sometimes y


i hope that you're the one
if not, you are the prototype

well you only need the light when it's burning low
only miss the sun when it starts to snow
only know you love her when you let her go
only know you've been high when you're feeling low
only hate the road when you're missing home
only know you love her when you let her go
and you let her go...

staring at the bottom of your glass
hoping one day you'll make a dream last
but dreams come slow and they go so fast
you see her when you close your eyes
maybe one day you'll understand why
everything you touch surely dies

but you only need the light when it's burning low
only miss the sun when it starts to snow
only know you love her when you let her go
only know you've been high when you're feeling low
only hate the road when you're missing home
only know you love her when you let her go

staring at the ceiling in the dark
same old empty feeling in your heart
'cause love comes slow and it goes so fast
well you see her when you fall asleep
but never to touch and never to keep
'cause you loved her too much and you dived too deep

well you only need the light when it's burning low
only miss the sun when it starts to snow
only know you love her when you let her go
only know you've been high when you're feeling low
only hate the road when you're missing home
only know you love her when you let her go
and you let her go...

oh, oh, woah, oh, oh
and you let her go
oh, oh, woah, oh, oh
when you let her go

only miss the sun when it starts to snow
only know you love her when you let her go
only know you've been high when you're feeling low
only hate the road when you're missing home
only know you love her when you let her go
'cause you only need the light when it's burning low
only miss the sun when it starts to snow
only know you love her when you let her go
only know you've been high when you're feeling low
only hate the road when you're missing home
only know you love her when you let her go
and you let her go...

taking shots out the bottle and now alcoholics anonymous
smoking white rhinoceros with zach galifinakis

practicing karate kicks on people back in the audience
popping klonopin, obviously, shots'll be honestly

books on not giving a fuck is what they're referring us  wolf gang 
wolves, i know you heard of us, we're murderers
and young enough to get the fucking priest to come and flirt with us
you niggas rap about fucking bitches and getting head
instead i rap about fucking bitches and getting heads
while you niggas stacking bread, i can stack a couple dead
bodies, making red look less of a color, more of a hobby
i'm not a rapper nor a rapist nor a racist
i fuck bitches with no permission and tend to hate shit
brag about the actions in a rhyming pattern matter
then proceed to sat her down when i go splatter in her chatterbox
atta boy, odd future, you're not in our categore
torture with the super soaker at the asian liquor store
this the type of shit that make a chris brown want to kick a whore
that make songs about the wet blockers when it rains and pours
 umbrella  i hate this, screaming fuck patience
got a nigga shaking like the calmest fucking haitian
after chronic masturbation, asking where mary kate went
i want to be the reasons why all lesbians hate dick
i make this damn bullwinkle the red moose
game of duck duck duct tape with a dead goose
she running 'round this motherfucking dungeon, her legs loose
until i accidentally get the saw to her head, oops
victim, victim, honey, you're my fifth one
honey on that topping when i stuff you in my system
rape a pregnant bitch and tell my friends i had a threesome
you got a fucking death wish? i'm a genie, it'll get done
nice to meet you, but it's more pleasant to eat you
with a leaf of salad and some dressing pouring out a teacup
bitch, i'm tyler the creature, suck your feet up like a beach of leeches
rubber more than the fucking bottom of a sneaker
jeeper the fucking creeper, get your daughter and keep her
in the jeeps where the wolf gang rides around deeper
take her to ladera, now she's scared and you're embarrassed
filled with terror, chop her legs off and tell her to run some errands
put her eyes in a canteen, take her to the berrics
stare at steve, say it costs ten to fuck eric
put her in the lake, her body sinks great, now it's time to fish her like derek
satan says we're dangerous, we're trading kids for angel dust
and snuff and sniff, and now that michael jackson's trying to suck our dick
hippopot the fucking llamas, dead bodies, cheerleading squaders
gave the team a bunch of fucking bees and the keke palmer
they will never catch him or catch up
they asked me what it was, i told them fuckers it was ketchup
nutty like my chex mix, she bleeding from her rectum
odd future wolves stirring ruckus, throwing sets up, yep
this the type of shit that make children break in apartments
when you tell a fucking orphan you don't love them 'til they heart thin
 i hate you   starve her 'til i carve her then i shove her in the rover
where i cut her like a barber with a parkinson's disorder
store her in a portable freezer with me to portland
catch me with a bunch of fucking mexicans crossing the border  arriba  
i'll be the only wetback who ain't really touched the water
cause i'll be too fucking busy tryna flirt with jesus' daughter
 fuck mary  i'm awesome, and i fuck dolphins
sicker than the starving nigerian kids barfing
odd future wolf gang nazi bar mitzvah
with your sister at the bar playing leg and arm twister
evident that i'm the shit, i'm the pooh like tigger dick
i got these cracker doctors saying, "yeah bob, this nigga's sick"
animal safari, if i offend you i'm sorry
because i'm the blackest skinhead since india arie
i don't smoke weed, so no need for the matches
i said fuck coke and now i'm snorting hitler's ashes
i plan on either dying for suicide or my asthma
being the only bastard in a box logo casket
rashes on my dick from licks of shishkabob sagets
in some kanye west glasses screaming out "fuck faggots"
catch me in my attic taking photos of my dad's dick
drop the beat here to make it extra climactic

it's probably been 12 years since my father left, left me fatherless
and i just used to say i hate him in dishonest jest

and every time i got the chance to say it i would swallow it
sixteen, i'm hollow, intolerant, skip shots
i storm that whole bottle, i'll show you a role model
i'm drunk, pissy, pissing on somebody front lawn
trying to figure out how and when the fuck i missed moderate
momma often was offering peace offerings
think, wheeze cough, scoffing and he's off again
searching for a big brother, tyler was that
and plus he liked how i rap, the blunted mice in the trap
too black for the white kids, and too white for the blacks
from honor roll to cracking locks up off them bicycle racks
i'm indecisive, i'm scatterbrained, and i'm frightened, it's evident
in them eyes, where he hiding all them icicles at?

supreme garment and weed gardeners garnishing spliffs
with keef particles and entering apartments with 'zine article
tolerance for boundaries, i know you happy now
craven and these complex fuck niggas done track me down
just to be the guys that did it, like, "i like attention"
not the type where niggas trying to get a raise at my expense
supposed to be grateful, right? like, "thanks so much, you made my life
harder, and the ties between my mom and i are strained and tightened
even more than they were before all of this shit"
been back a week and i already feel like calling it quits

thank you 


i woke up with a fear this morning
but i can taste you on the tip of my tongue
alone without no warning
you're by my side and we've got smoke in our lungs

last night we were way up, kissing in the back of the cab
and then you say, "love, baby, let's go back to my flat"
and when we wake up, never had a feeling like that
i got a reason, so man, put that record on again

i don't wanna hear sad songs anymore
i only wanna hear love songs
i found my heart up in this place tonight
don't wanna sing mad songs anymore
only wanna sing your song
'cause your song's got me feeling like i'm

i'm in love, i'm in love, i'm in love
yeah, you know, your song's got me feeling like i'm

no fear but i think i'm falling, i'm not proud
but i'm usually the type of girl that would hit and run
no risk so i think i'm all in
when i kiss your lips, feel my heartbeat thump

and now we're way up, dancing on the roof of the house
and then we make love, right there on your best friend's couch
and then you say "love, this is what it's all about"
so keep on kissing my mouth and put that record on again

i don't wanna hear sad songs anymore
i only wanna hear love songs
i found my heart up in this place tonight
don't wanna sing mad songs anymore
only wanna sing your song
'cause your song's got me feeling like i'm

i'm in love, i'm in love, i'm in love
i'm in love, i'm in love, i'm in love
i'm in love, i'm in love, i'm in love
yeah, you know your song's got me feeling like i'm

i don't wanna hear sad songs anymore
i only wanna hear love songs
i found my heart up in this place tonight
don't wanna sing mad songs anymore
only wanna sing your song
'cause your song's got me feeling like i'm

i don't wanna hear sad songs anymore
i only wanna hear love songs
i found my heart up in this place tonight
don't wanna sing mad songs anymore
only wanna sing your song
'cause your song's got me feeling like i'm

i'm in love, i'm in love, i'm in love
i'm in love, i'm in love, i'm in love
i'm in love, i'm in love, i'm in love
yeah, you know your song's got me feeling like i'm


now and then i think of when we were together
like when you said you felt so happy you could die
told myself that you were right for me
but felt so lonely in your company
but that was love and it's an ache i still remember

you can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness
like resignation to the end, always the end
so when we found that we could not make sense
well you said that we would still be friends
but i'll admit that i was glad that it was over

but you didn't have to cut me off
make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
and i don't even need your love
but you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough
no you didn't have to stoop so low
have your friends collect your records and then change your number
i guess that i don't need that though
now you're just somebody that i used to know
now you're just somebody that i used to know
now you're just somebody that i used to know

now and then i think of all the times you screwed me over
but had me believing it was always something that i'd done
and i don't wanna live that way
reading into every word you say
you said that you could let it go
and i wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know

but you didn't have to cut me off
make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
and i don't even need your love
but you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough
no you didn't have to stoop so low
have your friends collect your records and then change your number
i guess that i don't need that though
now you're just somebody that i used to know
now you're just somebody that i used to know
now you're just somebody that i used to know
[outro: gianni   group
somebody
i used to know
now you're just somebody
that i used to know
somebody
i used to know
now you're just somebody
that i used to know

these guys have got no hope
their flow's coke, it's been stepped on
like three times, they've got weak lines
dead lines, they've got no shots
these shots at me? i mean, these swines
i grew up in e5

"boogie down was performing, hey they ain't no joke"
"down with the sound called b d p"

back in the days i knew rap would never die
i used to listen to awesome 2 on whbi
i used to hear all kind of rap groups before sampling loops
rappers wore bell bottom lee suits
me and kenny couldn't afford that
so we would go to the park when they was jammin' to hear rap
i used to listen till the cops broke it up
i always thought to myself "damn, why they fucked it up?"
but nevertheless i was in love with the microphone
and it stayed that way until i left home
on the streets of new york, now i'm free
but with freedom comes big responsibility
i used to walk around driven by the force
i remember how large super rhymes was when he fell off
i used to wonder about crews that used to rock
they were large, but none of them could manage to stay on top

do you ever think about when you outta here?
record deal and video outta here?
mercedes benz and range rover outta here?
no doubt bdp is old school, but we ain't goin' out 

after livin' on the streets alone
some years went by, i signed myself into a group home
i used to watch the show "i dream of jeannie"
and dreamt about "when will i be large like whodini?"
but i was messin' with graffiti on the subway
and gettin' chased by the cops almost everyday
i knew it had to bea better way see
so i would go to my room, blast run dmc
around 1984 i left the group home, again alone
still dreamin' about the microphone
gimme a chance man, i know i can rock it
but i had to worry about puttin' money in my pocket
so when i reached the shelter i met my helper dj scott la rock
and we both loved hip hop
i was takin' suckas out in the shelter system
yeah there was rappers in the shelter but i had to diss 'em
but all along, my vision was never lost
i kept seeing all these rap groups fallin' off

do you ever think about when you're outta here?
fly girl and fresh gear outta here?
five thousand dollar love seat outta here?
no doubt bdp is old school, but we ain't goin' out 

while i'm battling these rival crews
yes, bdp would stay in the street news
some said, all they wanna do is battle
they can't write a song, so their careers won't last long 
around this time i used to hang with ced gee
and dj scott la rock used to buy gold with eric b
i didn't meet rakim till later with scott
i remember we were jammin' at the rooftop
it used to irk me when these critics had opinions
scott would say "just keep rappin', i'll keep spinnin'"
we had a fucked up contract, but we signed it
and dropped the hip hop album criminal minded
we told the critics your opinions are bull
same time eric b and rakim dropped paid in full
hip hop pioneers we didn't ask to be
but right then hip hop changed drastically
people didn't wanna hear the old rap sound
we started samplin' beats by james brown
in the middle of doin' "my philosophy"
scott was killed and that shit got to me
but knowin' the laws of life and death
i knew his breath, was one with my breath
i had nothin' left and it was scary
so i dropped by all means necessary
another hip hop group that was a friend of me
was a revolution crew called public enemy
it takes a nation of millions to hold us back
these two albums set off consciousness in rap
but all along, i'm still lookin' around
and all i can see are these rap groups fallin' down

do you ever think about when you outta here?
condominium and beach house outta here?
credit cards and bank accounts outta here?
no doubt bdp is old school, be we ain't goin' out 


don't, don't play with her, don't be dishonest  ayy 
still not understandin' this logic  ayy 
i'm back and i'm better  and i'm better 
i want you bad as ever
don't let me just let up
i wanna give you better
baby, it's whatever
somebody gotta step up
girl, i'm that somebody, so i'm next up
be damned if i let him catch up
it's easy to see that you're fed up
i am on a whole 'nother level
girl, he only fucked you over cause you let him
fuck him, girl, i guess he didn't know any better
girl, that man didn't show any effort
do all i can just to show you you're special
certain it's your love that holds me together
lately you say he been killin' the vibe
gotta be sick of this guy
pull up, skrr, get in the ride
left hand is steerin' the other is grippin' your thigh
light up a spliff and get high
shawty, you deserve what you've been missin'
lookin' at you i'm thinkin' he must be trippin'
play this song for him, tell him, "just listen"

don't
don't

girl, said he keeps on playin' games
and his lovin' ain't the same
i don't know what to say, but
what a shame
if you were mine you would not get the same
if you were mine you would top everything
suicide in the drop switchin' lanes
and that thing so fire, baby, no propane
got good pussy, girl, can i be frank?
to keep it one hundred, girl, i ain't no saint
but he the only reason that i'm feelin' this way
givin' you the world, baby, when you get space
pen game get me laid, baby, that's penetrate
oh baby

no role models and i'm here right now
no role models to speak of
searchin' through my memory, my memory, i couldn't find one
last night i was gettin' my feet rubbed
by the baddest bitch, not trina but i swear to god
this bitch'll make you call your girl up
and tell her, "hey, what's good?"
"sorry i'm never comin' home, i'ma stay for good."
then hang the phone up and proceed to lay the wood
i came fast like 9 1 1 in white neighborhoods
ain't got no shame 'bout it
she think i'm spoiled and i'm rich 'cause i can have any bitch
i got defensive and said, "nah, i was the same without it."
but then i thought back, back to a better me
before i was a b list celebrity
before i started callin' bitches "bitches" so heavily
back when you could get a platinum plaque without no melody
you wasn't sweatin' me

one time for my l.a. sisters
one time for my l.a. hoes
lame niggas can't tell the difference
one time for a nigga who know

don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
don't save her, she don't wanna be saved

i want a real love, dark skinned aunt viv love
that jada and that will love
that leave a toothbrush at your crib love
and you ain't gotta wonder whether that's your kid love
nigga, i don't want no bitch from reality shows
out of touch with reality hoes
out in hollywood bringin' back five or six hoes
fuck 'em then we kick 'em to the do'
nigga, you know how it go

one time for my l.a. sisters
one time for my l.a. hoes
lame niggas can't tell the difference
one time for a nigga who know

don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
don't save her, she don't wanna be saved

there's an old saying in tennessee i know it's in texas, probably in tennessee that says, fool me once  shame on  shame on you. fool me, you can't get fooled again

fool me one time, shame on you
fool me twice, can't put the blame on you

load the chopper, let it rain on you
fool me one time, shame on you
fool me twice, can't put the blame on you
fool me three times, fuck the peace sign
load the chopper, let it rain on you

now all i'm left with is hoes from reality shows
hand her a script, the bitch probably couldn't read along
my only regret was too young for sade adu

i'm that nigga, but i never got my head up my ass
you doin' good, but i'm ready for bad
and you won't never catch me frontin' 'cause i'm used to bein' second to last
respect the game

to need release
uncontrollably

i wanna go all the way, taking out my freak tonight

this is a story about a girl named lucky

early morning, she wakes up
knock, knock, knock on the door
it's time for makeup, perfect smile
it's you they're all waiting for

they go, "isn't she lovely, this hollywood girl?"
and they say

"she's so lucky, she's a star
but she cry, cry, cries in her lonely heart, thinking
if there's nothing missing in my life
then why do these tears come at night?"

lost in an image, in a dream
but there's no one there to wake her up
and the world is spinning, and she keeps on winning
but tell me, what happens when it stops?

they go, "isn't she lovely, this hollywood girl?"
and they say

"she's so lucky, she's a star

then why do these tears come at night?"

"best actress, and the winner is, lucky "
"i'm roger johnson for pop news, standing outside the arena waiting for lucky"
"oh my god, here she comes "

isn't she lovely, this hollywood girl?
she is so lucky, but why does she cry?
if there is nothing missing in her life
why do tears come at night?
and they say

"she's so lucky, she's a star
but she cry, cry, cries in her lonely heart, thinking
if there's nothing missing in my life
then why do these tears come at night?"
she's so lucky, she's a star

the cars were cutting like knives in a fist fight
and i found you with a bottle of wine
your head in the curtains
and heart like the fourth of july
you swore and said
we are not
we are not shining stars
this i know
i never said we are
though i've never been through hell like that
i've closed enough windows
to know you can never look back

of your feet upon the ground

i can cheat it all
to make up for the times i've been cheated on
and it's nice to know
when i was left for dead
i was found and now i don't roam these streets
i am not the ghost you want of me

on our darkest day
when we're miles away
so we'll come
we will find our way home

if you're lost and alone
or you're sinking like a stone
carry on
may your past be the sound
of your feet upon the ground
carry on
carry on, carry on

well i woke up to the sound of silence
the cars were cutting like knives in a fist fight
and i found you with a bottle of wine
your head in the curtains
and heart like the fourth of july
you swore and said
we are not
we are not shining stars
this i know
i never said we are
though i've never been through hell like that
i've closed enough windows
to know you can never look back

if you're lost and alone
or you're sinking like a stone
carry on
may your past be the sound
of your feet upon the ground
carry on
carry on, carry on

so i met up with some friends
at the edge of the night
at a bar off 75
and we talked and talked
about how our parents will die
all our neighbors and wives
but i'd like to think
i can cheat it all
to make up for the times i've been cheated on
and it's nice to know
when i was left for dead
i was found and now i don't roam these streets
i am not the ghost you want of me

if you're lost and alone
or you're sinking like a stone
carry on
may your past be the sound
of your feet upon the ground
carry on
carry on, carry on

woah
my head is on fire
but my legs are fine
after all they are mine
lay your clothes down on the floor
close the door
hold the phone
show me how
no one's ever gonna stop us now


cause we are
we are shining stars
we are invincible
we are who we are
on our darkest day
when we're miles away
so we'll come
we will find our way home

if you're lost and alone
or you're sinking like a stone
carry on
may your past be the sound
of your feet upon the ground
carry on
carry on, carry on

no one's ever gonna stop us now


you've been dressing up the truth
i've been dressing up for you

even when i'm sleepin' you think i'm cheatin'
you said: "i know you, mr. o.p.p. man
yo, pp man, won't only see me man"
you should've known when i ain't hit it and step
that i was wit' it a bit, not to consider the rep, heck 
i did your partner 'cause she's hot as a baker
'cause i'm naughty by nature, not 'cause i hate ya
you put your heart in a part of a part that spreads apart
and forgot that i forgave when you had a spark
you try to act like somethin' really big is missin'
even though my name's graffiti written on your kitten
i love black women always and disrespect ain't the way
let's start a family today; hip hop hooray

ho, hey, ho
hey, ho, hey, ho
hip hop hooray
ho, hey, ho
hey, ho, hey, ho

hip hop, hip hip hop, hip hip hop, hooray 
there's many hungry hip hoppers
one reason hip hop's tip top today
swerve what you heard 'cause i ain't bailin' no hay
ain't choppin' no crops, but still growin' every day

here's a thunder sound from the wonders found
from the underground town down the hill
feel how illtown drown smiles to frowns
snatchin' crowns from clowns, beatdowns are found
don't know me? don't come around 

tippy tippy  pause  tippy tippy  pause 
sometimes creepin' up i eat em up
your styles are older than lou rawls
peace to this one and that one and them
that way i shout out and i didn't miss one friend
fools get foolish, neither them or parker lewis knew us
you could have crews with shoes and can't step to us
some kitties purr, now call me sir too
lookin' for her crew; any trick that diss gets a curfew
i put on projects for boots
step through troops and leave proof
my problem solver's name is mook
i hittin' woodies in a hoodie
peace to josette, jobete, jo jo, genae, and every hood g
that's right, my fight is ill
peace goes to l.o.n.s. and quest
nice   smooth and cypress hill
i live and die for hip hop, this is hip hop of today
i give props to hip hop, so hip hop hooray

ho, hey, ho
hey, ho, hey, ho
hip hop hooray
ho, hey, ho
hey, ho, hey, ho

smooth it out now 


i sit alone in my four cornered room
starin' at candles
oh, that shit is on?
let me drop some shit like this here, real smooth

at night i can't sleep, i toss and turn
candlesticks in the dark, visions of bodies bein' burned
four walls just starin' at a nigga
i'm paranoid, sleepin' with my finger on the trigger
my mother's always stressin' i ain't livin' right
but i ain't goin' out without a fight
see, every time my eyes close
i start sweatin' and blood starts comin' out my nose
it's somebody watchin' the ak'
but i don't know who it is, so i'm watchin' my back
i can see him when i'm deep in the covers
when i awake i don't see the motherfucker
he owns a black hat like i own
a black suit and a cane like my own
some might say, "take a chill, b."
but fuck that shit  there's a nigga tryin' to kill me
i'm poppin' in the clip when the wind blows
every 20 seconds got me peepin' out my window
investigatin' the joint for traps
checkin' my telephone for taps
i'm starin' at the woman on the corner
it's fucked up when your mind's playin' tricks on ya

i make big money, i drive big cars
everybody know me; it's like i'm a movie star
but late at night, somethin' ain't right
i feel i'm bein' tailed by the same sucker's headlights
is it that fool that i ran off the block?
or is it that nigga last week that i shot?
or is it the one i beat for 5000 dollars?
thought he had 'caine, but it was gold medal flour
reached under my seat, grabbed my popper for the suckers
ain't no use to me lyin'
i was scareder than a motherfucker
hooked a left into popeye's and bailed out quick
if it's goin' down, let's get this shit over with
here they come just like i figured
i got my hand on the motherfuckin' trigger
what i saw'll make your ass start gigglin'
three blind, crippled and crazy senior citizens
i live by the sword
i take my boys everywhere i go, because i'm paranoid
i keep lookin' over my shoulder
and peepin' around corners; my mind is playin' tricks on me

day by day it's more impossible to cope
i feel like i'm the one that's doin' dope
can't keep a steady hand, because i'm nervous
every sunday morning i'm in service
prayin' for forgiveness
and tryin' to find an exit out the business
i know the lord is lookin' at me
but yet and still it's hard for me to feel happy
i often drift when i drive
havin' fatal thoughts of suicide
bang and get it over with
and then i'm worry free, but that's bullshit
i got a little boy to look after
and if i die, then my child'll be a bastard
i had a woman down with me
but to me it seemed like she was down to get me
she helped me out in this shit
but to me she was just another bitch
now she's back with her mother
now i'm realizing that i love her
now i'm feelin' lonely
my mind is playin' tricks on me

this year halloween fell on a weekend
me and geto boys are trick or treatin'
robbin' little kids for bags
'til a law man got behind our ass
so we speeded up the pace
took a look back and he was right before our face
he'd be in for a squabble, no doubt
so i swung and hit the nigga in his mouth
he was goin' down we figured
but this wasn't no ordinary nigga
he stood about six or seven feet
now that's the nigga i be seein' in my sleep
so we triple teamed on him
droppin' them motherfuckin' b's on him
the more i swung, the more blood flew
then he disappeared and my boys disappeared too
then i felt just like a fiend
it wasn't even close to halloween
it was dark as fuck on the streets
my hands were all bloody from punchin' on the concrete
goddamn, homie 
my mind is playin' tricks on me

dave, drop a load on 'em 

o.p.p., how can i explain it? i'll take it, frame by frame it
to have y'all all jumpin', shoutin', sayin' it
o is for "other," p is for "peoples'," scratch your temple
the last p, well, that's not that simple
it's sort of like, well, another way to call a cat a kitten
it's five little letters that are missin' here
you get on occasion if the other party isn't gamin'
it seems i gotta start the explainin', bust it
you ever had a girl and met her on a nice hello
you get her name and number
and then left feelin' real mellow
you get home, wait a day
she's what you wanna know about, then you call up
and it s her girlfriend s or her cousin s house? 
it s not a front, a f to the r to the o to the n to the t;
it's just her boyfriend's at her house
 oh, that s why she s scary 
it's o.p.p., time other people's what you get it
there's no room for relationship, there's just room to hit it
how many brothers out there know just what i'm gettin' at
who think it's wrong 'cause i was splittin' and co hittin' that
well, if you do, that's o.p.p. and you're not down with it
but if you don't, here's your membership

you down with o.p.p.?  yeah, you know me  
you down with o.p.p.?  yeah, you know me  
you down with o.p.p.?  yeah, you know me  
who s down with o.p.p.?  every last homie  
you down with o.p.p.?  yeah, you know me  
you down with o.p.p.?  yeah, you know me  
you down with o.p.p.?  yeah, you know me  
who s down with o.p.p.?  all the homies  

well, for the ladies o.p.p. means somethin' gifted
the first two letters' the same
but the last is somethin' different
it's the longest, loveliest, lean, i call it the leanest
it's another five letter word
rhymin' with "cleanness" or "meanness"
i won't get into that, i'll do it ah sorta properly
i'll say the last p, hmmm, stands for "property"
now lady, here comes a kiss
blow a kiss back to me, now tell me exactly
have you ever known a brother
who had another, like, a girl or wife
and you just had to stop a toast
'cause he looked just that nice?
you looked at him, he looked at you
and you knew right away
he had someone but he was gonna be yours anyway 
you couldn't be seen with him at all and still you didn't care
'cause in a room behind a door no one but y'all are there
when y'all are finished, y'all can leave
and only y'all would know; and then y'all could throw that skeleton bone right in the closet do'
now don't be shy
'cause if you're down i want your hands up high
say o.p.p.  o.p.p.   i like to say with pride
now when you do it, do it well and make sure that it counts
you're now down with a discount

you down with o.p.p.?  yeah, you know me  
you down with o.p.p.?  yeah, you know me  
you down with o.p.p.?  yeah, you know me  
who s down with o.p.p.?  every last lady  
you down with o.p.p.?  yeah, you know me  
you down with o.p.p.?  yeah, you know me  
you down with o.p.p.?  yeah, you know me  
who s down with o.p.p.?  all the ladies  

a scab tried to o.p.p. me, i had a girl and she knew that
matter of fact, her and my girl was partners that
had a fall out, disagreement, yeah, an argument
she tried to do me, so we did it in my apartment
bust it  that wasn't the thing
it must've been the way she hit the ceiling, 'cause after that she kept on comin' back and catchin' feelings
i said: "let's go, my girl is comin', so you gotta leave."
she said: "oh no, i love you, treach "
i said: "now child, please  you gots to leave
come grab your coat, right now you gotta go "
i said: "now look you chooses stairs or choose the stair window
this was a fling, a little thing
you shouldn't have brought your heart
'cause you know i was opp, hell, from the very start "
come on, come on, now let me tell you what it's all about
when you get down, you can't go 'round
runnin' off at the mouth
that's rule number one in this o.p.p. establishment
you keep yo' mouth shut and it won't get back to her or him 
excitin', isn't it? a special kinda business
many of you will catch the same sorta o.p.p. messin' with
him or her, for sure ain't goin' to admit it
when o.p.p. comes, damn skippy, i'm with it

you down with o.p.p.?  yeah, you know me  
you down with o.p.p.?  yeah, you know me  
you down with o.p.p.?  yeah, you know me  
who s down with o.p.p.?  this whole party  
you down with o.p.p.?  yeah, you know me  
you down with o.p.p.?  yeah, you know me  
you down with o.p.p.?  yeah, you know me  
who s down with o.p.p.?  this whole party  


i dedicate this record, the carnival, to all you brothers takin' long trips down south, virginia, baltimore, all around the world, and your girl gets this message that you ain't comin' back. she's sittin' back in the room, the lights are off, she's cryin', and then my voice comes in, pow , in the middle of the night, and this is what i told her for you

every time i make a run
girl, you turn around and cry
i ask myself why, oh why

so he won't mess up in summer school in the summer

what do i stand for?
what do i stand for?
most nights, i don't know anymore

this is it, boys, this is war
what are we waiting for?
why don't we break the rules already?
i was never one to believe the hype
save that for the black and white
try twice as hard and i'm half as liked
but here they come again to jack my style
and that's alright, i found a martyr in my bed tonight
she stops my bones from wondering
just who i, who, i, who i am
oh, who am i?

well, some nights, i wish that this all would end
'cause i could use some friends for a change
and some nights, i'm scared you'll forget me again
some nights, i always win  i always win 
but i still wake up, i still see your ghost
oh lord, i'm still not sure what i stand for, oh
what do i stand for?
what do i stand for?
most nights, i don't know

 oh, come on  so this is it?

the dream i just had about you and me
i called you up, but we'd both agree

fly alone, fly alone, far away
fly alone, fly alone, far away

i appreciate your perspective, especially cause you get it
essentially it feels destined, no questions or second guessing
but my impression is kinda like kevin left by his parents
forgetting left him alone at the home protecting it and
he ain't know it but he was growing
confessing that
even though ain't perfected
it s golden, hold it it s precious
and now were older
thread has decided to reconnect us
i ain't never headed out without feathers made outta heaven
i won t...
fly alone, fly alone, far away
fly alone, fly alone, far away

i have been away for so long
i just wanna come home
miss my mom and my dog
i'm on my way
i, i, i been away for so, been away for so long
i just wanna come home
i'm on my way

there's something to be cherished about the familiarity
parents and family, helping hands that have taken care of me
barely would've made it without those relationships
i wouldn't trade for riches or the other things they say you should
but it's true, it'd be cool if i had a pool in the backyard
hundred acre home with a fast car
facts are, i don't care for it if they ain't there for it
need the perfect people in my life for me to share it with
fly alone, fly alone, far away
fly alone, fly alone, far away

i have been away for so long
i just wanna come home
miss my mom and my dog
i'm on my way
i, i, i been away for so, been away for so long
i just wanna come home
i'm on my way
fly alone, fly alone
fly alone, fly alone, fly away


i thought that i was dreaming when you said you loved me
the start of nothing, i had no chance to prepare
i couldn't see you coming
the start of nothing, i could hate you now
it's quite alright to hate me now
when we both know that deep down
the feeling still deep down is good

if i could see through walls, i could see you're faking
if you could see my thoughts, you would see our faces
safe in my rental like an armored truck back then
we didn't give a fuck back then
i ain't a kid no more, we'll never be those kids again
we'd drive to syd's, had the x6 back then, back then
no matter what i did, my waves wouldn't dip back then
everything sucked back then, we were friends

i thought that i was dreaming when you said you loved me
the start of nothing, i had no chance to prepare
i couldn't see you coming
the start of nothing, i could hate you now
it's quite alright to hate me now
but we both know that deep down
the feeling still deep down is good

in the halls of your hotel
arm around my shoulder so i could tell
how much i meant to you, meant it sincere back then
we had time to kill back then
you ain't a kid no more, we'll never be those kids again
it's not the same, ivory's illegal, don't you remember?

i broke your heart last week
you'll probably feel better by the weekend
still remember, had you going crazy
screaming my name, the feeling deep down is good

i thought that i was dreaming when you said you loved me
the start of nothing, had no chance to prepare
couldn't see you coming
and we started from nothing, i could hate you now
it's alright to hate me now
we both know that deep down
the feeling still deep down is good

all the things i didn't mean to say, i didn't mean to do
there were things you didn't need to say
did you mean to? mean to...
i've been dreaming of you, dreaming of you
i've been dreaming of you, dreaming of you
i've been dreaming, dreaming

hands hands in the in the air air now 
hands... in da... air... now 
  bring 'em out, bring 'em out + ad libs to the end of the track  


now and then i think of when we were together
like when you said you felt so happy you could die
told myself that you were right for me
but felt so lonely in your company
but that was love and it's an ache i still remember

you can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness
like resignation to the end, always the end
so when we found that we could not make sense
well you said that we would still be friends
but i'll admit that i was glad that it was over

but you didn't have to cut me off
make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
and i don't even need your love
but you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough
no you didn't have to stoop so low
have your friends collect your records and then change your number
i guess that i don't need that though
now you're just somebody that i used to know
now you're just somebody that i used to know
now you're just somebody that i used to know

now and then i think of all the times you screwed me over
but had me believing it was always something that i'd done
and i don't wanna live that way
reading into every word you say
you said that you could let it go
and i wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know

but you didn't have to cut me off
make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
and i don't even need your love
but you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough
no you didn't have to stoop so low
have your friends collect your records and then change your number
i guess that i don't need that though
now you're just somebody that i used to know
now you're just somebody that i used to know
now you're just somebody that i used to know
[outro: gianni   group

i think i got it inside out 'cause
even when i try, i
someone always lets me down, i

baby, don't touch me 'less you gonna love me, 'less you gonna
just because i love you don't mean that i can trust you

yeah, i roll with the punches
swear, the ones that i like are the type to eat people for lunch
i've got bundles of something
i don't know what it is but i know i could give it to someone
if i could find the right one somewhere
yeah, maybe my approach is unclear
yeah, maybe there's someone out somewhere i don't know
i probably never go 'cause

 go on with the truth, fam  oh, man
just because i love you don't mean that i can trust you
 go on with the truth, fam  oh, man
don't misunderstand me, i don't think i'm above you, babe
this ain't something new
i've been dealing with this my whole life, no lie, babe
i can't pick and choose who i love
leave it up to the guy in the sky

hard on the outside, i
i think i got it inside out 'cause
even when i try, i
someone always lets me down, i

just because i love you don't mean that i can trust you, don't mean that i could
just because i love you don't mean that i can trust you

i can hear them say there's so much more to life
baby, don't be so dramatic, take your time
but it's too hard not to think that one day when everyone is paid
i'll be here somewhere  go on with the truth, fam 

hard on the outside, i
i think i got it inside out 'cause
even when i try, i
someone always lets me down, i
hard on the outside, i
i think i got it inside out 'cause
even when i try, i
someone always lets me down, i

this ain't something new
i've been dealing with this my whole life, no lie, babe
i can pick and choose who i love
leave it up to the guy in the sky


you're not the type, type a girl
to remain with a guy, with a guy too shy too afraid
to say he'll give his heart to you forever
i'm not the boy who will fall to his knees
with his hands clasped tight beggin' beggin' you please
to stay with him for worse or for better

but i'm staring at you now
there's no one else around
i'm thinking you're the girl for me

i'm just saying it's fine by me
if you never leave
and we can live like this forever
it's fine by me

in the past i would try
try hard to commit to a girl
wouldn't get too far
it always somehow seemed to fall apart
but with you i can see what i need
i can dream realistically
i knew that this was different from the start
and it seems that every time we're eye to eye
i can find another piece of you, that i don't want to lose

and i'm staring at you now
there's no one else around
i'm thinking you're the girl i need

i'm just saying it's fine by me

it's fine by me
i'm just saying it's fine by me
if you never leave
and we can live like this forever
it's fine by me

and it's never easy
but darling believe me
i'm as skeptical as you
but when i think of life without us
it seems like what we're supposed to do
but i don't wanna come on too strong

i'm just saying it's fine by me
if you never leave
and we can live like this forever
it's fine by me
it's fine by me
if you never leave
and we can live like this forever
it's fine by me
i'm just saying it's fine by me

i know you see me with the ice on
i want to see you with the light the lights on
she tryna wiggle in my section
you go hard when it's my song
i know these dudes be all in your face
spin a check, tryna get you to their place
moving fast like they tryna win a race
and that's cool but i ain't down for the chase
i got big bills, phone calls to make deals
playing your cards right, just wait 'til i deal
and you do what you want when you copping
i would chase but i got too many options

i've been watching you, all night
i need your body, tonight

wait now, let me get it first
going down to your back, muscles hurt
eyy, throw it in reverse
eyy, throw it in reverse
go up, down to the dirt

she only like me for the diamond on my wrist
diamonds on my neck, six diamonds on the check  on the check

she only riding for the diamond on my wrist
diamonds on my neck, six diamonds on the check  on the check 
she only like me for the diamond on my wrist
diamonds on my neck, six diamonds on the check  on the check 


i'll be honest, i wasn't devastated
but you could've held my hands through this, baby
let my mind run underneath warm jets
i run my hands through what's left
but we're getting older, baby
don t have much longer baby
why am i preaching?
to this choir, to this atheist
just like mine, versions of these belong to you
after a while, they're keeping me close to you
 just like me, they long to be close to you 


this is what you do, this is what you do
this is what you do, this is what you do

you make me wanna leave the one i'm with
start a new relationship with you, this is what you do
think about a ring and all the things that come along with
you make me, you make me
you make me wanna leave the one i'm with
start a new relationship with you, this is what you do
think about a ring and all the things that come along with
you make me, you make me

before anything began between us
you were like my best friend
the one i used to run and talk to when me and my girl was having problems
you used to say it would be okay
suggest little nice things i should do
and when i go home at night and lay my head down
all i seem to think about is you
and how...

you make me wanna leave the one i'm with
start a new relationship with you, this is what you do
think about a ring and all the things that come along with
you make me, you make me
you make me wanna leave the one i'm with
start a new relationship with you, this is what you do
think about a ring and all the things that come along with
you make me, you make me

now, what's bad is you're the one that hooked us up
knowing it should've been you
what's sad is i love her, but i'm falling for you
what should i do?
should i, tell my baby bye bye?
should i, do exactly what i feel inside?
'cause i, i don't wanna go, don't need to stay
but i really need to get it together

you make me wanna leave the one i'm with
start a new relationship with you, this is what you do
think about a ring and all the things that come along with
you make me, you make me
you make me wanna leave the one i'm with
start a new relationship with you, this is what you do
think about a ring and all the things that come along with
you make me, you make me

at this point, the situation's out of control
i never meant to hurt her, but i gotta let her go
and she may not understand it while all of this is going on
i tried, i tried to fight it, but the feeling's just too strong
you make, make, make me

you make me wanna...
you make me wanna...
you make me wanna...
you make me wanna...
you make me wanna...
you make me wanna...
you make me wanna...
you make me wanna...
come along with
you're making me, you're making me

you make me wanna leave the one i'm with
start a new relationship with you, this is what you do
think about a ring and all the things that come along with
you make me, you make me
you make me wanna leave the one i'm with
start a new relationship with you, this is what you do
think about a ring and all the things that come along with
you make me, you make me
you make me wanna leave the one i'm with
start a new relationship with you, this is what you do
think about a ring and all the things that come along with

and i pace myself
i know these money hungry bitches wanna taste my wealth
but i keep em on a diet
embrace they health, or either keep em on the quiet
and space myself and just take a deep breath
i got em grabbing they chest
cause it's hurting them to see fab in his best
and they in they worst
they'd rather see me lay in a hearse than lay in the 'bach
and i ain't just laying a verse, i'm saying the facts
i came back with some sicker stones
that got these broke niggas looking at me

and make it hard to  breathe 
they has to react, like having an asthma attack
when they see the plasma in back
you dudes are wheezing behind me
my flow is like a coupe, breezing at ninety
that's the reason they signed me
the slick metaphors and hard punches on the cuts
feels something like hard punches to the gut
how i address the haters and underestimaters
and ride up on em like they escalators
they shook up and hooked up to respirators
on they last breath talking to investigators

can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars?
i could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now
can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars?
i could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now

yeah
i could use a dream or a genie or a wish
to go back to a place much simpler than this
'cause after all the partyin' and smashin' and crashin'
and all the glitz and the glam and the fashion
and all the pandemonium and all the madness
there comes a time where you fade to the blackness
and when you starin' at that phone in your lap
and you hopin', but them people never call you back
but that's just how the story unfolds
you get another hand soon after you fold
and when your plans unravel in the sand
what would you wish for if you had one chance?
so airplane, airplane, sorry i'm late
i'm on my way, so don't close that gate
if i don't make that, then i'll switch my flight
and i'll be right back at it by the end of the night

can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars?
i could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now
can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars?
i could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now

yeah, yeah
somebody take me back to the days
before this was a job, before i got paid
before it ever mattered what i had in my bank
yeah, back when i was tryna get a tip at subway
and back when i was rappin' for the hell of it
but nowadays we rappin' to stay relevant
i'm guessin' that if we can make some wishes out of airplanes
then maybe, oh maybe, i'll go back to the days
before the politics that we call the rap game
and back when ain't nobody listened to my mixtape
and back before i tried to cover up my slang
but this is for decatur what's up, bobby ray?
so can i get a wish to end the politics
and get back to the music that started this shit?
so here i stand and then again i say
i'm hopin' we can make some wishes out of airplanes

can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars?
i could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now
can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars?
i could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now

i could really use a wish right now
i, i, i could really use a wish right now
like, like, like shooting stars
i, i, i could really use a wish right now
a wish, a wish right now

i sip the dom p, watchin' gandhi 'til i'm charged, then
writin' in my book of rhymes, all the words past the margin
behold the mic i'm throbbin', mechanical movement
understandable smooth shit that murderers move with
the thief's theme, play me at night, they won't act right
the fiend of hip hop has got me stuck like a crack pipe
the mind activation, react like i'm facin'
time like pappy mason, with pens i'm embracin'
wipe the sweat off my dome, spit the phlegm on the streets
suede timbs on my feet makes my cipher complete
whether cruisin' in a six cab or montero jeep
i can't call it, the beats make me fallin' asleep
i keep fallin', but never fallin' six feet deep

to my man ill will
god bless your life
to my peoples throughout queens
god bless your life
i trip, we box up crazy bitches
aimin' guns in all my baby pictures
beef with housing police, release scriptures that's maybe hitler's
yet i'm the mild, money gettin' style, rollin' foul
the versatile, honey stickin', wild, golden child
dwellin' in the rotten apple, you get tackled
or caught by the devil's lasso, shit is a hassle
there's no days for broke days
we sell it, smoke pays, while all the old folks pray
to jesús, soakin' their sins in trays of holy water
odds against nas are slaughter
thinkin' a word best describin' my life to name my daughter
my strength, my son, the star will be my resurrection
born in correction, all the wrong shit i did
he'll lead a right direction
how you livin'? large, a broker charge, cards are mediocre
you flippin' coke or playin' spit, spades, and strip poker?

 it's yours 
it's mine, it's mine, it's mine whose world is this?
the world is yours, the world is yours
it's mine, it's mine, it's mine whose world is this?
 it's yours 
it's mine, it's mine, it's mine whose world is this?
yo, the world is yours, the world is yours
it's mine, it's mine, it's mine whose world is this?
 it's yours 

break it down
it's yours, it's yours
it's yours, it's yours

i'm the young city bandit, hold myself down single handed
for murder raps, i kick my thoughts alone, get remanded
born alone, die alone, no crew to keep my crown or throne
i'm deep by sound alone, caved inside, 1,000 miles from home
i need a new nigga for this black cloud to follow
 cause while it's over me it's too dark to see tomorrow
tryin' to maintain, i flip, fill the clip to the tip
picturin' my peeps not eatin' can make my heartbeat skip
and i'm amped up, they locked the champ up
even my brain's in handcuffs
headed for indiana, stabbin' women like the phantom
the crew is lampin', big willie style
check the chip toothed smile, plus i profile wild
stash loot in fly clothes, burnin' dollars to light my stoge
walk the blocks with a bop, checkin' dames
plus the games people play bust the problems of the world today

 it's yours 
it's mine, it's mine, it's mine whose world is this?
the world is yours, the world is yours
it's mine, it's mine, it's mine whose world is this?
 it's yours 
the world is yours, the world is yours
it's mine, it's mine, it's mine whose world is this?
 it's yours 
yeah, the world is yours, the world is yours
it's mine, it's mine, it's mine whose world is this?

before this, did you really know what live was?
comprehend to the track, for it's why cuz
gettin measures on the tip of the vibers
rock and roll to the beat of the funk fuzz
wipe your feet really good on the rhythm rug
if you feel the urge to freak, do the jitterbug
come and spread your arms if you really need a hug
afrocentric living is a big shrug
a life filled with fun that's what i love
a lower plateau is what we're above
if you diss us, we won't even think of
will nipper the doggy give a big shove?
this rhythm really fits like a snug glove
like a box of positives it's a plus, love
as the tribe flies high like a dove

right now, phife is a poem sayer
at times, i'm a studio conveyor
mr. dinkins, would you please be my mayor?
you'll be doing us a really big favor
boy this track really has a lot of flavor
when it comes to rhythms, quest is your savior
follow us for the funky behavior
make a note on the rhythm we gave ya
feel free, drop your pants, check your ha ir
do you like the garments that we wear?
i instruct you to be the obeyer
a rhythm recipe that you'll savor
doesn't matter if you're minor or major
yes, the tribe of the game we're the player
as you inhale like a breath of fresh air
 can i kick it? 


i got thick skin, but not as thick as they want it
i ain't too cool to be affected by the hate in the comments
and now my problems gettin' big like christopher wallace
and i wanna fight back without resortin' to violence
got a message from a girl, told me, "artists like you
get me through a tough day when it's heavy at school"
i replied, "don't you let up," but replies mess my head up
come to think about it, maybe i am just like you

they can say what they wanna
but it's time i let it go
'cause i been holdin' on for too long
so it's time to let 'em know

i've had about enough, you can't take me out, oh no
'cause i'ma build me up, you can't break me down no more
i'm singing oh oh, oh oh
when the world's weighin' on your back
you should know that i will carry that
i'ma build you up, so they can't break you down no more
they can't break you down no more
they can't break you down no more
they can't break you down no more

i put myself out there, feeling no repercussion
i understand i have a voice i need to spread to the public
so let me ask you just one question, would you say it in person?
keep the same energy as i'm addressing the subject
what if i brought myself down to that level and tried to dim your light?
instead, i let you shine like a bezel
i'd rather fight for something i believe, changin' like the seasons
people out here grievin', that's why my pen is bleedin', it's bleedin'

they can say what they wanna
but it's time i let it go
'cause i been holdin' on for too long
so it's time to let 'em know

i've had about enough, you can't take me out, oh no
'cause i'ma build me up, you can't break me down no more
i'm singing oh oh, oh oh
when the world's weighin' on your back
you should know that i will carry that
i'ma build you up, so they can't break you down no more
they can't break you down no more
they can't break you down no more
they can't break you down no more

i've been running, running my whole life
so i ain't runnin' from you
i've been running, running my whole life
so i ain't runnin' from you

i've had about enough, you can't take me out, oh no
'cause i'ma build me up, you can't break me down no more
i'm singing oh oh, oh oh
when the world's weighin' on your back
you should know that i will carry that
i'ma build you up, so they can't break you down no more
they can't break you down no more
they can't break you down no more
they can't break you down no more

they can't break you down no more
they can't break you down no more

and the time is  one minute, six seconds 
 magic stick  i got the magic box
have that ass trickin after one back shot
 the gifts, the ice, i like that a lot 
the minks, the leathers, the cl drop

i got the magic stick
i know if i can hit once, i can hit twice
i hit the baddest chicks
shorty don't believe me, then come with me tonight
and i'll show you maaagic
 what? what?  maaagic
i got the magic stick

i got the magic clit

shorty you don't believe me, then come with me tonight
and i'll show you maaagic
 what? what?  maaagic, uh huh uh huh
i got the magic clit



i thought that this was something, yes
promising that one day it would turn into something, yes
thought the feelings were mutual
and i didn't have to guess
started being skeptical
always unavailable
like you didn't know
but now i'm feeling something, else
that's telling me this may not be the real something, else
but you was showing me
now i'm ready and you running
damn you got me open now
feeling like i'm choking now
where am i to go?

i can't believe that you can't feel my heart
and i can't believe you let me fall so hard
stop playing, how could you let it go this far?
if you had doubts that i wasn't the one
you said that you're the type to take it slow
you said before i step i'll let you know
stop playing before you let me see you with her
you could have told me a change was gon' come. yeah

is she the reason you don't call like you use to?
fall through my hood like you use to?
or put it on me hard like you use to do?
i feel in my mind what's going on
but my heart won't let me go until i know
is she the reason that my calls couldn't reach you?
the deepest of my love couldn't please you?
or bring it to me home like you use to do?
seeing her falling for your charms
got me feeling like i wasn't good enough

see i know we're not official, no
but us being official ain't ever been an issue, no
it came down to us, boy
remember we were different?
we said that we'd talk if we ever had problems about anything
i was cool with no commitment, wait
let me take that back
it was you so i was with it, see
i guess i didn't get when you showed you didn't miss it
now it seems that your interest ain't here
we ain't the same

i can't believe that you can't feel my heart
and i can't believe you let me fall so hard
stop playing, how could you let it go this far?
if you had doubts that i wasn't the one
you said that you're the type to take it slow
you said before i step i'll let you know
stop playing before you let me see you with her

but my heart won't let me go until i know
is she the reason that my calls couldn't reach you?
the deepest of my love couldn't please you?
or bring it to me home like you use to do?
me seeing her falling for your charms
got me feeling like i wasn't good enough

all you had to say was this ain't what you want
i won't be so hurt and i could just move on
you had me believing everything was my fault
but i can see it now
it's a situation that i must let go
cause you ain't gonna be a man and let me know
i guess me seeing you with her tells it all

is she the reason you don't call like you use to?
fall through my hood like you use to?
or put it on me hard like you use to do?
i know in my mind what's going on
but my heart won't let me go until i know
is she the reason that my calls couldn't reach you?
the deepest of my love couldn't please you?
or bring it to me home like you use to do?

you ain't gotta tell me i been on your mind
you fell asleep in my t shirt
gripping my pillow tight
you didn't think i would be here tonight
went to bed listenin' to what we like
made the perfect little playlist
looks like somebody was makin' plans to welcome me home again

but i landed early and i couldn't wait up
i been missin' you lately, i made my escape
but it seems like i'm already here in your dreams
and i couldn't stand to mess up a good thing

 it's been a mighty long time since i held you tight 
but i can't wake you when you're dreaming of me
 get ready for the sunrise, i'ma make it right 
but i can't wake you when you're dreaming of me

lately i've been puttin' in overtime, life on the road can get lonely
i was never good with time away and it gets a little harder everyday
everything is better when i'm by your side, i mean the world is amazin'
all i ever really want to do is make my way back to you

but i landed early and i couldn't wait up
i been missin' you lately, i made my escape
but it seems like i'm already here in your dreams
and i couldn't stand to mess up a good thing

 it's been a mighty long time since i held you tight 
but i can't wake you when you're dreaming of me
 get ready for the sunrise, i'ma make it right 
but i can't wake you when you're dreaming of me

you've been calling my phone all day
i'm sorry if i made you worry
but now that i'm standin' in your grace
i'm reminded why i have to earn it

 it's been a mighty long time since i held you tight 
but i can't wake you when your dreaming of me
 get ready for the sunrise, i'ma make it right 
but i can't wake you when you're dreaming of me


hey, i wanna give you a little advice
i noticed that you're not acting yourself
and i'm sure you're probably having some problems in your relationship
but, i want to tell you this
i met this guy that, uh, this guy that you dated
and i can't think of his name, but anyway
he says he's a nice young fella
and i gotta say this, if you're willing to work it out
that shows you love one another

for him she packed all her louie  all her louie 
all her gucci  all her gucci 
all her prada  all her prada 
but somehow she left her heart
i heard that she called her momma  she called her momma 
told her she's leaving  told her she's leaving 
said she was tired  said she was tired 
momma said, "tired ain't through"
she didn't understand
she didn't know the power of man
so we both know
one day she's going back to be with him, be with him
so whoever's ? is just a rebound, rebound, a rebound
i call it recess
but when this gets old, you better know, she's going back
to that good old, good old
faithful, faithful, faithful

dear me, you got some work to do to better you
he said some hurtful things, but i know all of it was true
i may not mean it though it comes off as an attitude
and that ain't good for us, when we have problems i can't talk 'em through
gotta learn to listen, can't cut him off when he talkin' too
i know you only get upset though cause you love him, this is true
really don't understand and he need to stop and listen too
a two way street, you both need to meet like tires on the coupe
i know it's hard cause you was raised that way just like your momma
and you yell a bit and that was it, that really drove him off the roof
got you packin' bags, when inside you know you don't wanna lose
what you got, cause baby make you laugh and when it all is cool
and all is cool, but then you got some pride and got some scars to prove
that you don't trust him, thought your heart is crying all the baby blues
the other dude's lyin' about the way you feel about him too
and momma askin' how you do and you say, "fine" she know that you
pretending, she remembering that she was young just like you
tryin' to talk, but you won't listen, stubborn but you're hurtin' boo
you left your heart and i know he's all you think about
brand new start just won't happen cause you just can't do without


yo, i got it bad i'm tryin' to fight it, hide it from the world
but momma's right, damn, she really knows her baby girl
checkin' on his twitter page to see what he did yesterday
i miss him and this dating game i'm playing is just that, a game
thumbing through my contacts, always manage to stop on his name
i wanna call him, well dammit won't you do it then?
i tell myself, wastin' all this time on all these other men
that interest and it's just a break though until i'm back with him
unless he datin' too, unlike me, havin' fun with them
makin' love with them, cause maybe he feels that i'm over him
then what? what if he don't take me back forever
then i'm left here with these maybes and what if we stuck together
and these why you nevers, like why you never call him?
thinkin' of my lonely days stuck in my room bawlin'
rain on the window mirror, saw the tears i let go
my pride and all these scars inside, it's time for me to let go
so what we fall, like momma said, it's not unusual
need to pack my bags, go back, cause what we had was beautiful



when you feel your heart's guarded
and you see the break has started
when the clouds have all departed
you'll be right here with me
b rock, darkchild
we back
you'll be right here with me
you'll be right here with me

when your life is going too fast off the train tracks
i can slow it down
just when you think you're 'bout to turn back
scared you might crash
i'll be your ground

when you feel your heart's guarded
and you see the break has started
when the clouds have all departed
you'll be right here with me
when your tears have dried from cryin'
and the world has turned to silent
when the clouds have all departed
you will be right here with me

i'll be right here with you, you'll be right here with me
i'll be right here with you, you'll be right here with me, yeah

when you're trapped and there's just no key
and you can't breathe, i'll breathe for you
the fire's got you down on both knees
and the walls are closing in, but i'll be breaking through
and when you feel alone, i'ma be your home
when others come and go, you know i got you

when you feel your heart's guarded
and you see the break has started
when the clouds have all departed
you'll be right here with me
 you'll see the sun 
when your tears have dried from cryin'
and the world has turned to silent

you'll be right here with me  right here 
when your tears have dried from cryin'
 we ain't never goin' nowhere 
and the world has turned to silent
 gonna tell the world we're here 
when the clouds have all departed

when you feel your heart's guarded
and you see the break has started
when the clouds have all departed
you'll be right here with me
when your tears have dried from cryin'
and the world has turned to silent
when the clouds have all departed
you will be right here with me

i'll be right here with you, you'll be right here with me
i'll be right here with you, you'll be right here with me
i'll be right here with you, you'll be right here with me
i'll be right here with you, you'll be right here with me, yeah


i will always love you how i do
let go of a prayer for you
just a sweet word
the table is prepared for you
 ooh, ooh, ooh 
ball so hard, all my boys flex
wishing you godspeed, glory
there will be mountains you won't move
 ooh, ooh, ooh 
still i'll always be there for you how i do
i let go of my claim on you
it's a free world
you look down on where you came from sometimes
but you'll have this place to call home always

this love will keep us through blinding of the eyes
silence in the ears, darkness of the mind
until it's time
this love will keep us through blinding of the eyes
silence in the ears, darkness of the mind
it's 'til it's time we die
this love will keep us through blinding of the eyes
silence in the ears, darkness of the mind

oh oh, ohhh
i'll always love you
until the time we die
oh oh, ohhh

mas n o sou mais t o crian a
a ponto de saber tudo

 s vezes o que eu vejo quase ningu m v 
eu sei que voc  sabe quase sem querer
que eu vejo o mesmo que voc 
t o correto e t o bonito
o infinito   realmente um dos deuses mais lindos
sei que  s vezes uso palavras repetidas
mas quais s o as palavras que nunca s o ditas?
me disseram que voc

he's a legend in the making
this voice is the blame to fame
his rhythm is similar to basketball
the way he shakes and he fakes and he takes some more
with everything he does, makes me feel his love
when the dj plays this song and we all sing along

take all of your wasted honor
every little past frustration
take all of your so called problems
better put 'em in quotations

say what you need to say
say what you need to say
say what you need to say
say what you need to say
say what you need to say
say what you need to say
say what you need to say
say what you need to say

walking like a one man army
fighting with the shadows in your head
living out the same old moment
knowing you'd be better off instead
if you could only

say what you need to say
say what you need to say
say what you need to say
say what you need to say
say what you need to say
say what you need to say
say what you need to say
say what you need to say

have no fear for giving in
have no fear for giving over
you'd better know that in the end
it's better to say too much
than never say what you need to say again
even if your hands are shaking
and your faith is broken
even as the eyes are closing
do it with a heart wide open

say what you need to say
say what you need to say
say what you need to say
say what you need to say
say what you need to say
say what you need to say

ayer los dos so  bamos con un mundo perfecto
ayer a nuestros labios les sobraban las palabras
porque en los ojos nos espi bamos el alma
y la verdad no vacilaba en tu mirada
ayer nos prometimos conquistar el mundo entero
ayer tú me juraste que este amor seria eterno
por que una vez equivocarse es suficiente
para aprender lo que es amar sinceramente

qu  hiciste? hoy destruiste con tu orgullo la esperanza
hoy empa aste con tu furia mi mirada
borraste toda nuestra historia con tu rabia
y confundiste tanto amor que te entregaba
como permiso para as  romperme el alma

qu  hiciste? nos obligaste a destruir las madrugadas
y nuestras noches las ahogaron tus palabras
mis ilusiones acabaron con tus falsas
se te olvido que era el amor lo que importaba
y con tus manos derrumbaste nuestra casa

ma ana que amanezca un d a nuevo en mi universo
ma ana no ver  tu nombre escrito entre mis versos
no escuchare palabras de arrepentimiento
ignorare sin pena tu remordimiento
ma ana olvidare que ayer yo fui tu fiel amante
ma ana ni siquiera habr  razones para odiarte
yo borrare todos tus sue os de mis sue os
que el viento arrastre para siempre tus recuerdos

qu  hiciste? hoy destruiste con tu orgullo la esperanza
hoy empa aste con tu furia mi mirada
borraste toda nuestra historia con tu rabia
y confundiste tanto amor que te entregaba
como permiso para as  romperme el alma

qu  hiciste? nos obligaste a destruir las madrugadas
y nuestras noches las ahogaron tus palabras
mis ilusiones acabaron con tus falsas
se te olvido que era el amor lo que importaba
y con tus manos derrumbaste nuestra casa

y confundiste tanto amor que te entregaba
como permiso para as  romperme el alma

qu  hiciste? nos obligaste a destruir las madrugadas
y nuestras noches las borraron tus palabras
mis ilusiones acabaron con tus falsas
se te olvido que era el amor lo que importaba
y con tus manos derrumbaste nuestra casa

tenho andado distra do
impaciente e indeciso
ainda estou confuso s  que agora   diferente
tô t o tranquilo e t o contente
quantas vezes desperdicei
quando o que eu mais queria
era provar pra todo mundo
que eu n o precisava provar nada pra ningu m
me fiz em mil peda os pra voc  juntar
e queria sempre achar explica  o pra o que eu sentia
como um anjo ca do fiz quest o de esquecer
que mentir pra si mesmo   sempre a pior mentira
mas n o sou mais t o crian a
a ponto de saber tudo
j  n o me preocupo se eu n o sei por que
 s vezes o que eu vejo quase ningu m v 
eu sei que voc  sabe quase sem querer
que eu vejo o mesmo que voc 
t o correto e t o bonito
o infinito   realmente um dos deuses mais lindos
sei que  s vezes uso palavras repetidas
mas quais s o as palavras que nunca s o ditas?
me disseram que voc 
estava chorando
e foi ent o que eu percebi
como te quero tanto
j  n o me preocupo se eu n o sei por que
 s vezes i que eu vejo quase ningu m v 
eu sei que voc  sabe quase sem querer
que eu vejo o mesmo que voc

had a bitterness when i looked back
was telling everyone it's not that bad
 til all my shit hit the fan

i know i'm always like
telling everybody you don't gotta be a victim
life ain t always fair, but hell is living in resentment
choose redemption, your happy ending's up to you

i think it's time to practice what i preach
exorcise the demons inside me
whoa, gotta learn to let it go
the past can't haunt me if i don't let it
live and learn and never forget it
whoa, gotta learn to let it go

had a boogieman under my bed
putting crazy thoughts inside my head
always whispering, "it's all your fault"
he was telling me, "no, you're not that strong"

telling everybody you don t gotta be a victim

first got it when he was six, didn't know any tricks
matter of fact, first time he got on it, he slipped
landed on his hip and busted his lip
for a week he had to talk with a lisp, like thisss
now we can end the story right here
but shorty didn't quit, it was something in the air
yeah, he said it was something so appealing
he couldn't fight the feeling, something about it
he knew he couldn't doubt it, couldn't understand it
branded, since the first kickflip he landed, uh
labeled a misfit, a bandit
ka kunk, ka kunk, ka kunk; his neighbors couldn't stand it
so, he was banished to the park
started in the morning, wouldn't stop 'til after dark
yeah, when they said "it's getting late in here
so i'm sorry, young man, there's no skating here"

and so he kick, push, kick, push
kick, push, kick, push; coast
and away he rolled
just a rebel to the world with no place to go
and so he kick, push, kick, push
kick, push, kick, push; coast
so come and skate with me
just a rebel looking for a place to be
so let's kick
and push
and coast
uh, uh, uh

my man got a little older, became a better roller
yeah, no helmet, hell bent on killing himself
is what his mama said, but he was feeling himself
got a little more swagger in his style
met his girlfriend, she was clapping in the crowd
love is what what was happening to him now
he said "i would marry you
but i'm engaged to these aerials and varials
and i don't think this board is strong enough to carry two"
she said "bow, i weigh a hundred and twenty pounds
now, let me make one thing clear
i don't need to ride yours, i got mine right here"
so she took him to a spot he didn't know about
some odd end apartment parking lot
she said "i don't normally take dates in here"
security came and said "i'm sorry, there's no skating here"

and so they kick, push, kick, push
kick, push, kick, push; coast
and away they roll
just lovers intertwined with no place to go
and so they kick, push, kick, push
kick, push, kick, push; coast
so come and skate with me
just a rebel looking for a place to be
so let's kick, uh, uh
and push, yeah, yeah

yeah, yeah
before he knew, he had a crew that wasn't no punk
in they spitfire shirts and sb dunks
they would push 'til they couldn't skate no more
office building lobbies wasn't safe no more
and it wasn't like they wasn't getting chased no more
just the freedom was better than breathing, they said
an escape route they used to escape out
when things got crazy, they needed to break out
they'd head to any place with stairs
any good grinds, the world was theirs
and their four wheels would take them there
until the cops came and said "there's no skating here"

and so they kick, push, kick, push
kick, push, kick, push; coast
and away they rolled
just rebels without a cause with no place to go
and so they kick, push, kick, push
kick, push, kick, push; coast

and i ain't scared to kiss you, girl, or hold your hand
and the strangest thing happens to me when you laugh
but the hardest part of loving, girl...
'cause when i'm with you i'm not a superstar, i'm just a man

who ushers in
the air i need to power my sail

when i open the window

like a gust of wind
you head me off sometimes
like a gust of wind

matter of fact tyrone was on speed dial
so when she got home, it was going down, she go:

to lend each other uncover emotions when lights dim
so when she telling her to come over, it'll be alright

didn't expect to come across a crazy gunner
"hey, shorty, check it for the bag and the dough "
but he was brave, looked him in the eye, and said "no "
money splattered him, bow  then he snatched the bag
hit his pockets, then he jetted up the ave
girls screamin', the noise up and down the block
 hey, rakeem   what?  your little brother got shot  
i ran frantically, then i dropped down to his feet
i saw the blood all over the hot concrete
i picked him up, then i held him by his head
his eyes shut, that's when i knew he was 
aw man  how do i say goodbye?
it's always the good ones that have to die
memories in the corner of my mind
flashbacks, i was laughin' all the time
i taught him all about the bees and birds
but i wish i had a chance to sing these three words

after laughter comes tears

me and my man, my ace big moe from the shelter
'bout to hit the skins from this girl named thelma
now, thelma had a rep that was higher than her neck
every girl from shaolin dissed her respect
we was stimmy, you know how it is when you're blitzed
three o'clock in the mornin', somethin' got to give
moe said he'll go first, i said i'll take next
here, take this raincoat and practice safe sex 
he seemed to ignore, i said, "be for real 
she's not even worth it to go raw deal."
a man's gonna do what a man's gonna do
he got butt naked and stuck the power u
twenty minutes went by, moe, i'm out without a doubt
i'm not pumpin' up, i am airin' out
hey yo, he came out laughin' with glory
i'm surprised he's still livin' to tell his story
but he carried on with the same old stuff
with stephanie, like a whammy, he pressed his luck
moe tried to be down with o.p.p.
ain't nothin' wrong, but he got caught with the h.i.v.
now no life to live, doc says two more years
so after the laughter i guess comes the tears

after laughter comes tears

maybe i'm a fool
maybe i should move and settle
two kids and a swimming pool
i'm not brave  brave 
i'm not brave

i'm living over city
and taking in the homeless sometimes, uh
been living in an idea
an idea from another man's mind
maybe i'm a fool
to settle for a place with some nice views
maybe i should move, settle down
two kids and a swimming pool
i'm not brave
i'd rather live outside

speaking of nirvana, it was there
rare as the feathers on my dash from a phoenix
there with my crooked teeth and companion sleeping, yeah
dreaming a thought that could dream about a thought
that could think of the dreamer that thought
that could think of dreaming and getting a glimmer of god
i be dreaming of dreaming a thought
that could dream about a thought
that could think of dreaming a dream
where i cannot, where i cannot

less morose and more present
dwell on my gifts for a second, a moment
one solar flare, we're consumed
so why not spend this flammable paper on the film that's my life?
high flights, inhale the vapor, exhale once and think twice
eat some shrooms, maybe have a good cry about you
see some colors, light hang glide off the moon

 in the dark, in the dark 
i'd do anything for you
 in the dark 
i'd do anything for you

i know i can
be what i wanna be
if i work hard at it
i'll be where i wanna be
i know i can  i know i can  
be what i wanna be  be what i wanna be  
if i work hard at it  if i work hard it  
i'll be where i wanna be  i'll be where i wanna be  

be, b boys and girls, listen up
you can be anything in the world, in god we trust
an architect, doctor, maybe an actress
but nothing comes easy, it takes much practice
like, i met a woman who's becoming a star
she was very beautiful, leaving people in awe
singing songs, lena horne, but the younger version
hung with the wrong person, got her strung on that heroin
cocaine, sniffing up drugs, all in her nose
could've died, so young, now looks ugly and old
no fun 'cause when she reaches for hugs, people hold their breath
'cause she smells of corrosion and death
watch the company you keep and the crowd you bring
'cause they came to do drugs and you came to sing
so if you gonna be the best, i'ma tell you how
put your hands in the air, and take the vow

i know i can  i know i can  
be what i wanna be  be what i wanna be  
if i work hard at it  if i work hard it  
i'll be where i wanna be  i'll be where i wanna be  
i know i can  i know i can  
be what i wanna be  be what i wanna be  
if i work hard at it  if i work hard it  
i'll be where i wanna be  i'll be where i wanna be  

be, b boys and girls, listen again
this is for grown looking girls who's only 10
the ones who watch videos and do what they see
as cute as can be, up in the club with fake id
careful, 'fore you meet a man with hiv
you can host the tv like oprah winfrey
whatever you decide, be careful, some men be
rapists, so act your age, don't pretend to be
older than you are, give yourself time to grow
you thinking he can give you wealth, but so
young boys, you can use a lot of help, you know
you thinking life's all about smoking weed and ice
you don't wanna be my age and can't read and write
begging different women for a place to sleep at night
smart boys turn to men and do whatever they wish
if you believe you can achieve, then say it like this

i know i can  i know i can  
be what i wanna be  be what i wanna be  
if i work hard at it  if i work hard it  
i'll be where i wanna be  i'll be where i wanna be  
now, go 
i know i can  i know i can  
be what i wanna be  be what i wanna be  
if i work hard at it  if i work hard it  
i'll be where i wanna be  i'll be where i wanna be  

be, be fore we came to this country
we were kings and queens, never porch monkeys
there was empires in africa called kush
timbuktu, where every race came to get books
to learn from black teachers who taught greeks and romans
asian arabs and gave them gold, when
gold was converted to money it all changed
money then became empowerment for europeans
the persian military invaded
they heard about the gold, the teachings, and everything sacred
africa was almost robbed naked
slavery was money, so they began making slave ships
egypt was the place that alexander the great went
he was so shocked at the mountains with black faces
shot up they nose to impose what basically
still goes on today, you see?
if the truth is told, the youth can grow
they learn to survive until they gain control
nobody says you have to be gangstas, hoes
read more, learn more, change the globe
ghetto children, do your thing
hold your head up, little man, you're a king
young princess when you get your wedding ring
your man is saying "she's my queen"

i know i can  i know i can  
be what i wanna be  be what i wanna be  
if i work hard at it  if i work hard it  
i'll be where i wanna be  i'll be where i wanna be  
i know i can  i know i can  
be what i wanna be  be what i wanna be  
if i work hard at it  if i work hard it  
i'll be where i wanna be  i'll be where i wanna be

look at what came in the mail
a scale and some arm and hammer
soul gold grill and a baby mama
black cadillac and a pack of pampers
stack of questions with no answers
cure for cancer, cure for aids
make a nigga wanna stay on tour for days
get back home, things are wrong

record number four, but we on a roll
hold up, slow up, stop, "control"
like janet, plan it, stankonia's on ya
moving like floyd, coming straight to florida

pulling off a belt 'cause a whipping's in order
like a three piece fish 'fore i cut your daughter
yo quiero taco bell, then i hit the border
pitty pat rappers trying to get to 5

i call my brother son cause he shine like one  solid gold 
 nigga, son, yo 

solid gold crown is shining, we're blinding like some diamonds
i'm reclining in the sky on a cloud with silver lining
double breasted, bullet proof vested, well protected
the heart, the rib cage, the chest and solar plexus
casting stones, cracking two hundred and six bones
and watch your ass get blown to a sea of fire and brimstone
how dare you approach it with them poems
the overfiend like noah bean green souls with a soldier mean
the grand exquisite imperial wizard or is it
the rzarector come to pay your ass a visit?
local bio chemical, universal giant, the black general
licking shots at davy crockett on the bicentennial
happy millennium two thousand
microchips, two shots of penicillin goes up your adrenalin
son it's time for bouting
it's a model you're resembling the niggas who like following
trapped inside your projects like a genie inside the bottle and...

god stepping forth upon holy ground of the track
it's the sound that surrounds and hurts me like i'm under attack
so i decided to bite down on the mic
so the pain of the track won't deny the fact that i'm the master
for what lurks, is an expert that hurts
the individual who tries to visualize under
cause i strike, like thunder
niggas couldn't stand my heat, it's unbearable
my wisdom fucks up your respiratorial
systems are fractured by the killer tactics
style is ragged and thoughts are mad jagged
enter the entity, my vicinity
is three hundred and sixty degrees of humidity
represent the school of hard knocks and glocks my
clan is hostile and got mad moss for blocks so
feel the force of impact from the iron side of
the gat as i attack the track
from the blind side of the pack, starks pass the chrome
watch a nigga get blown out his motherfucking dome piece
deceased, laid to rest

who come to get you, none, they want guns
i be the first to set off shit, last to run
wu roll together as one
i call my brother son cause he shine like one

yo, aiyyo i got this under my wing, move give me room
holding up your saloon, clean sweep, like a broom
full moons make me howl like a wolf out of breath
sold only new vocal cords you heard genius on gef
so step back, to the lab at, high velocity
my team make hand to hand sales, we're like a pharmacy
fuck geraldo, pablo's plan bro is bravo
goodfellas we know, best sellers become novels
the man rocking head bands, silk scarves and jams
early 80s british walkers, playboys, mocks and shams
the laser beam vocalist does well at symphonies
bad days, watch me snatch ice right outta tiffany's
remember them kids that came off with eight million
robbed the brinks and i labelled in royal pavilions
them flour heads must have been stupid
tell me how the fuck black niggas get caught with all that loot kid
there's jet money, underground money
submarines and rings, too bad you fucked up, dummies


man, i hate rap, but if the shoe fits, wear it
i've become a freak of nature all the kids stare at
who walk around bumpin' raw with the shit blarin'
saying "fuck school " and droppin' out like a miscarriage
i'm embarrassed and i'm ashamed
i played a part in this devilish game
makin' your common sense perish
but i ain't takin' the full blame,  cause most of you chumps runnin' around here ain't never had strict parents
all of your brain cells rottin' from weed
you feelin' like if you ain't got it, life's not as complete
you havin' sex with every motherfuckin' body you see
with a past so dark that satan'd jump out of his seat
but still you out in these streets, thinkin' you hot as can be
without the knowledge to lead, so you just follow the sheep
makin' sure your lame swag is all polished and clean
while your favorite rapper's like, "yeah, he got it from me."
you been brainwashed by a fake life that you're used to livin'
when i say the word "fun," what do you envision?
probably drinkin' and smokin' out with your crew and chillin'
with clueless women you tryin' to bang, bumpin' new edition
is that all you think life really is?
well, if so, then you're a fuckin' idiot
i honestly feel like grabbing your head and hitting it
matter of fact, you don't even deserve a brain   give me it 
do you even have any goals
aside from baggin' these hoes and packin' a bowl?
well, let me guess   no
you're only in school because your parents make you go
when all you do is play beer pong and hang out with the bros
yo, society's got you livin' for a whack cause
you're a fuckin' adult with no skills at all
you don't read any books or play ball
you don't draw   you literally do nothing at all 
still you fiend for the glamorous fruits
you don't have,  cause you idolize rappers that do
and all they say is, "i got money and it's stacked to the roof."
and now you think that it's gon' magically just happen to you?
how? your lazy ass don't commit to labor
you pick somethin' up, try it out, and put it down two minutes later
then you complain about your life  cause it ain't gettin' catered
now whoever tries to call you on your bullshit's a hater?
you wanna succeed, you have to try; or one day you'll get older
and regret it all  cause you can't provide
your friends are lowlives, don't act surprised
look, just cut the bad fruit off of the tree, make the sacrifice

girls, stop actin' like you want a guy
with traits like romeo   bitch, that's a fuckin' lie 
you always talk about how every man's fake and you can't take it
and you want somethin' real   shut up, tramp, save it 
twice a week you put on your makeup and damn bracelets
and head to the club half naked with your ass shakin'
pullin' a lowlife nigga who claim he cash makin'
'til you let him hit and find out he work at the gas station
one of them niggas got you pregnant and you can't raise it
but you caused it, your actions made a fat statement
you want romeo, then act patient
and stop frontin' like he in the club posted in the back waitin'
it's the club, where guys put on a new persona
after they get loaded with a few corona's
they always shoutin' and wild out
with habits that very few condone of
then they look for beautiful brainless bitches like you to bone 'em
then when they leave you, you cry and cry
talkin' about, "oh my god, i can't find a guy 
i've spent so many years and i've tried and tried 
why am i even on earth? i should die "
you want romeo, you're not worthy
you're cock thirsty, you're nasty and probably got herpes
sometimes the secret to finding is to stop searching
try a new formula,  cause your last one's not working

the term "real nigga" is publicly used
and i need to know what it means,  cause i'm fuckin' confused
are you one for always bustin' your tool
with nothin' to lose and somethin' to prove
to homies up in your crew?
is it because you're sellin' drugs to get loot
and brag about how you done been shot and stabbed
like it's fun to be you?
but your life's a struggle, right, and you just hustlin' through?
nah, you hamster ass nigga, you just stuck in a loop
man, why do black people gotta be the only ones who can't evolve?  cause you in the streets actin' like a neanderthal
it's clear you can't stand the law
you're lost as an abandoned dog
and all you're interested in is fightin', rappin' and basketball
i can't even fuck with you
 cause if we out in public, you gon' get caught stealin' some shit, and get my ass in trouble, too
you'll get old and be nothin'
livin' life in these streets, thuggin'
and starting shit with anybody mean muggin'
look at you, a real nigga, thinkin' your life's cool
girls used to turn me down for guys who were like you
'til you grab their heart and shove a spearhead right through
then they regret it because it wasn't the right move
your "real nigga" talk seems bogus
a real nigga don't brag about being real as long as he knows it
and his future doesn't seem hopeless
a real nigga stays out of jail, handles shit and he keeps focused

to all you rappers whose soul is out in the wrong
you inspired the issue i wrote about in this song
you go to prowl on the young who roam around in the slums
see, this is what happens when rap's overcrowded with bums
hope the hour is long when i'm rollin' out with your tongue
the man above is my guide, you know the power is strong
all you menacin' freaks are only in it for cheese
and the mass control limit was breached   fuck hip hop 
they only in it for cheese, and any eyewitness can see
they purposely makin' the innocent weak
my existence on this planet's for you, i ain't only here to benefit me
yo, we need to make a change while there's still time
it is hard, and sometimes i struggle tryin' to reveal mine
i can guide you if you feel blind
i just need you to be willin' to journey into my ill mind


shoo  shoo doo doo doo doo, ah 
shoo  shoo doo doo doo doo 
shoo  oh, oh, oh 
shoo  hey

to let you know just where i'm coming from, yeah
but you will see, it's just a matter of time

everyone seems so uptight
but nothin's wrong and it's alright with my man  my man 
i like the way we carry on
his love will send me on and on, with my man
people out there can understand

i'm giving him something he can feel

you know how much you love it when you get it in abundance
give a fuck about a budget when you always be the subject of discussion
but it's nothin' when you stop and just say fuck it
 cause you walkin' out in public and you hear them talkin' rubbish

and if she want an autograph she better bring a pen
yeah, the party never end, this life is what i recommend
and if you got a ho picked for me then she better be a 10
i ain't picky, but these girls be actin' tricky
when the situation's sticky and the liquor got 'em silly

i could say that you were just a special treat
though we both know that's not right

and i am afraid to need you so

that you may be my problem, not my love
'cause you go down smooth

layin' in your arms, wishin' you was here today, mom
wish you'd appear, just for a second from heaven
my tears would be gone, i wouldn't be rappin' this song
i'd be happy drivin' up to your eight bedroom mansion
up late, laughin' about the hard times we faced
the galaxy is so enchantin' beyond, galileo's understandin'
past the milky way and all the planets
there's somethin' out there greater, but only god knows
scientists claim we came from apes, but they lies though
that was part of our conversation
i spark one up and start blazin'
thinkin' of how amazin' she was, an angel gave me love
i'm thankful to ever know a woman so real

you wore that white sundress, smoked a clove cigarette
danced barefoot and your hair was a mess
you drove a jeep cherokee but no money for gas
coulda looked at you all day long, all day long
you tried to downplay your beauty but you couldn't fool me
you tried to play like you're tough but you grew up by the beach
said you hated the world but somehow you liked me
coulda looked at you all night long, all night long
coulda looked at you all night long, all night long

how can i forget you in the morning?

mama workin' like a dog but we still broke
we lighting candles in the house 'cause the lights off
the best thing that ever happened, i got kicked out
bought me a chevy, got a grill, now i'm gold mouthed
i lost my daddy last year, i couldn't even cry
'cause it's so hard to shed a tear, he didn't even try
the only person in the world i could fully trust
was my older brother vic, that's just how it was
top in the trunk, this for bankroll and slim dunk
i miss that girl beasley, she was a real one
i had an artist that i treated like my own son
gave him the shirt off my back and my own gun
r.i.p. to shawty lo, mister don don
it's been rainin' so long, when the sun comin'?
i'm drop top but put the top up when the storm comin'
sometimes i think about my past, it make me start tripping
i was gifted with a talent that was god given
but i was so hard headed i would not listen
sometimes i sit and i reflect about that cold prison
and doin' pull ups with a nigga got a life sentence
they gave my nigga grant life, he only gained on me
five years later, how we in the same room?
you go to jail, that's when you see who really love you
i don't think nobody love me like my auntie jean do
r.i.p my auntie jean and uncle goat too
how you gon' judge me? you don't know what i been through
i think these killers need a hug, i need a hug too
you send a slug, i'll send a slug, you know how thugs do
but i forgive, i been forgiven, i hold grudges too
i'm just a work in progress, i'm not even through
but i forgive, i been forgiven, i hold grudges too
i'm just a work in progress, i'm not even through

and a star was born that day

embracing my loco
saving my life and i'm sharp as a knife when i'm rippin' and letting my flow go
keeping it 'til i die, but my music's forever gonna fly

ayer los dos so  bamos con un mundo perfecto
ayer a nuestros labios les sobraban las palabras
porque en los ojos nos espi bamos el alma
y la verdad no vacilaba en tu mirada
ayer nos prometimos conquistar el mundo entero
ayer tú me juraste que este amor seria eterno
por que una vez equivocarse es suficiente
para aprender lo que es amar sinceramente

qu  hiciste? hoy destruiste con tu orgullo la esperanza
hoy empa aste con tu furia mi mirada
borraste toda nuestra historia con tu rabia
y confundiste tanto amor que te entregaba
como permiso para as  romperme el alma

qu  hiciste? nos obligaste a destruir las madrugadas
y nuestras noches las ahogaron tus palabras
mis ilusiones acabaron con tus falsas
se te olvido que era el amor lo que importaba
y con tus manos derrumbaste nuestra casa

ma ana que amanezca un d a nuevo en mi universo
ma ana no ver  tu nombre escrito entre mis versos
no escuchare palabras de arrepentimiento
ignorare sin pena tu remordimiento
ma ana olvidare que ayer yo fui tu fiel amante
ma ana ni siquiera habr  razones para odiarte
yo borrare todos tus sue os de mis sue os
que el viento arrastre para siempre tus recuerdos

qu  hiciste? hoy destruiste con tu orgullo la esperanza
hoy empa aste con tu furia mi mirada
borraste toda nuestra historia con tu rabia

when i sleep  i have dreams about the way we used to kiss
'bout the way you used to hold me
and say nothing would ever harm me
when we first met, oh, how you charmed me
made me smile when i was down
big pimping around the town, you and me
whenever they'd see you, they'd see me
a lover and a friend to me you were, how did it end?
how it hurts to not have you in my life
when i wanted to be your wife

you never know what you have 'til it's gone
treated you wrong for so long
now you're gone away
but the love still lives here

still, i still got love for you
still, after all we've been through
still, i gave my heart to you
and baby, you're the only one  the only one 
there's other men than you
still, they can come close to you
still, once i said, "i love you"
i knew you'd be the only one

a good man you were to me, always there to care
would do anything in this world for me  oh, oh 
didn't matter, what, when, or where, you were there
i never thought we'd part from the arguments we'd start
when i just wanted to get some attention  sorry 
and i'm sorry, baby for bitching
if i could take back the words
that i said to make you leave
i'd be down on bended knees
asking you to please forgive me

you never know what you have 'til it's gone
treated you wrong for so long
now you're gone away
but the love still lives here

still, i still got love for you
still, after all we've been through
still, i gave my heart to you
and baby, you're the only one  the only one 
there's other men than you
still, they can come close to you
still, once i said, "i love you"
i knew you'd be the only one

all of the good times we had together  together 
do they mean something to you?
do you ever wish we never split?
'cause i still got love for you

still, i still got love for you
still, after all we've been through
still, i gave my heart to you  gave my heart to you 
and baby, you're the only one

you still might drop it
and everybody wanna reach inside your pockets
i tell 'em "red light, stop it"
shit, that give me more headaches than alcoholics

there was nothin' in my wallet, just a lot o' dreamin'
i built a crib on top o' the promised land, we'll call it even
hm, i bring more flavor than all the seasons
winter, spring, summer, fall, the grass is always greener 'til i cut it all
please leave me to my studies, i give you no applause
my hands been countin' money, and it's hard to be the boss
but somebody gotta do it  it gets so exhausting 
often with the bullshit, but, baby, i been through it
enough for the both of us
so come over later and we won't let no one close to us
we could be posted up
yeah

okay, well, you could have the world in the palm of your hand

you can either sink, swim or be the captain
get the last word i'mma get the last laugh in
now they say "jidenna why you dressing so classic?"
i don t want my best dressed day in a casket
you can either lead, follow or get out the way
make a fuckin' move it would make my fuckin' day
got a 100 year plan you jus' think about today
always been about time more than been about pay
can't rump with me
usain couldn t run with me
chief come to find you
you don t come for me
at best you can run a lil' company
nigga at worst, i could run the whole country
that's right   pimp game like a brothel 
that's why   i don t judge a nigga's hustle 
i airbnb the crib like a hostel 
summer rate cheaper 'cause the streets get hostile
shaka boy, this fire from mojave boy
so no i won t record for your homie boy 
i turn the party out like a naughty toy
then i go and hide in plain sight like a lobby boy
yessuh, that's jidenna on the banner
ridin' for my niggas gettin' locked up in the slammer
elders saying everything's a nail to a hammer
and niggas can t spell but we know our instagrammar
well done's better than well said
i read niggas well, a nigga well read
really i ain't met nobody smarter
that's why i got admitted but i still rejected harvard
i m the fresh prince, in a school where they couldn t read
mama put me in a school with the kennedys
when i met bill clinton i was seventeen
but dead presidents is all my niggas need
dining with the governor's daughter
and her father say i remind him of obama
i m the chief diplomat...every day
and i m black and white...janelle monae

niggas fighting over rings
niggas wanna be the king, but
long live the chief
for a li' ol' thang lil' boys bang bang
long live the chief
niggas fighting over rings
niggas wanna be the king, but
long live the chief
now watch pretty mama while i slang my cane
long live the chief

no no no
you don't love me
and i know now
no no no
you don't love me
yes i know now
coz you left me

talib kweli verse 1:
it's a funky sen sa tion ain't it?
i'm havin a conversation wit'cho imagination
it was explainin how you was waitin, for somethin amazin
like when it come out you out the door racin to the store   zoom  
it took a lot of perse verance and patience
we was preparin for our place among the ancients
yo basically yo' take on me ain't makin me
or breakin me and yo i hate to see a fake mc
i take out all my competition from like a to z
cause i get fly more frequently than a travel agency
that's what i'm made to be, hip hop through my artery
an important part of me the soundtrack to my oddysey
it got me, rockin retardedly
pardon me for speakin incorrect politically
anything less would be me speakin hypocritically, and i don't do dat
you lingerie mc's i see through that
i make a point about you and your crew, go "tru dat"
who dat? it's the reflection
remember the name, slid in the game before the "2000 season" came
breakin the chain, usin the pain as our ammunition
to blast babylonian towers out of position
it's the reflection and we poppin like your ears on a plane
we make you disappear like tears in the rain
the fears in your brain is clear when i appear on the terrain
and bloody your nose
i got more lines than co caine that's why you sniffin' around
we diggin' for different sounds to keep it hittin'
straight up the only way we gettin' down with the sound is provacative
it's for the love and cause of that we got a lot to give
it's for the love and cause of that we got a lot to give
you got a issue with that then it ain't my problem kid
y'all niggas gotta eat, we gotta live, yo
we all gotta eat and gotta live

talib kweli verse 2:
we remain, hotter than the blue part of the flame
i got a glock in my brain
that baffle weapons inspections like saddam hussein
and rocks with the impact
gettin beat with socks filled with ten packs of tokens
men's backs get broken when i get open
words more than spoken
most of dem mc's on the first thing smokin
leavin town at the same time causin traffic on the interstate
we stay droppin classics cause the key word is innovate
these cats is so plastic that we call 'em laminated
tried to duplicate the style quickly got frustrated
more desperate than dudes who search people's ashtrays for clips
i burn mc's like coca cola through the paint on your whip
shit  my rhymes is like a magnifyin glass
when i shine my light through it, i burn up everything in my path
last dragon like lee roy  sho' nuff  rock for the b boy
my rhymes are so sharp you catch cuts that key loid
destroyed the decoy, most of y'all d boy, my culture
it's not that i hate, y'all just p noid cause y'all fake
embarassed and ashamed and don't know where to put the blame
and never hesitate to call out my name 
i ain't effected by the negative
it's the reflection and we dealin with the positive
it's for the love and cause of that we got a lot to give
it's the reflection kid
never gotta look between the lines to get the messages
you're too sensitive, checkin out our references
the turntable and microphone specialist
it's the reflection kid, it's the reflection kid
it's the reflection kid, like that like that

he drops his suitcase by the door
she knows her daddy won't be back anymore
she drags her feet across the floor
tryna hold back time to keep him holding on
and she says

daddy, daddy, don't leave
i'll do anything to keep you right here with me
can't you see how much i need you?
daddy, daddy, don't leave
mommy's saying things she don't mean
she don't know what she's talking about
somebody hear me out...

father listen
tell him that he's got a home and he don't have to go
father save him
i would do anything in return
i'll clean my room
try hard in school
i'll be good
i promise you
father, father
i pray to you

now she hasn't slept in weeks
she don't want to close her eyes
'cause she's scared that he'll leave
they've tried just about everything
but it's getting harder for him to breathe
and she says...

daddy, daddy, don't leave
i'll do anything to keep you right here with me
can't you see how much i need you
daddy, daddy, don't leave
the doctors are saying things they don't mean
they don't know what they talking about
somebody hear me out...

father listen
tell him that he's got a home and he don't have to go
father save him
i would do anything in return
i'll clean my room
try hard in school
i'll be good
i promise you
father, father
i pray to you

please don't let him go  don't let him go 
i'm begging you so  i'm begging you so 
there, open his eyes
need a little more time
to tell him that i love him more
than anything in the world
is daddy's little girl

father listen
tell him that he's got a home and he don't have to go
father save him
i would do anything in return
i'll clean my room
try hard in school
i'll be good
i promise you
father, father
i pray to you

she was daddy's little girl........


i lie here restless like lines for a guest list
waiting for your message, i call out your name
but nobody answers, we spiral like dancers
i'll write you these last words to say

i'm begging, begging, begging you to please don't go
i don't wanna see you be with someone else
don't make me drive at night in hollywood as evenings go
i don't wanna put what we had on the shelf

i only want you and us
i only want you and us
i only want you to trust
i only want you and us, and us, and us

i'm waiting for something to make me feel something
but nothing fills nothing like we used to be
remember, remember when we said forever
we locked it and we lost the key

i'm begging, begging, begging you to please don't go
i don't wanna see you be with someone else
don't make me drive at night in hollywood as evenings go
i don't wanna put what we had on the shelf

i only want you and us
i only want you and us
i only want you to trust
i only want you and us, and us, and us

oh, i don't wanna be lonely
oh, i just want you to hold me down
oh, i don't wanna be lonely
oh, i just wanna be alone with you

i only want you and us
i only want you and us
i only want you to trust
i only want you and us, and us, and us


i pledge allegiance to myself
food, shelter, and health
let me find a beach full of seashells to sell
put your oxygen mask on first before you offer me help
i've got receipts made of scar tissue
got the vision of somebody going fishing in the dark
when i start up the motor, it still turns over
but nowadays, a little bit slower
never been afraid of getting older
i'm much more nervous about these public servants
kill the lights and shut the curtains
you ain't a real lion if you love the circus
looking at myself like, "what's the purpose?"
that's when i started to hallucinate
tryna touch the surface and recuperate
you should've seen the look on my face when i was losing my faith
y'all got me feeling hesitation, embarrassment
i might be the last generation of grandparents
i know that i've been fortunate for all the opportunities
disproportionately disappointed in the human beings
i get it, we're specks of dust
at the bus stop busking for extra crust
like fuck it, you can sacrifice me to the weather
if you promise that you'll let my songs live forever

you're looking for a bag of tricks
but my love is like a stack of bricks
cobblestones and untreated lumber
i'm a father of fists, strength in numbers
and when they come for my box of dreams
i'ma finally depart from this toxic scene
no posturing, just lots of self esteem
got you feeling like the popular queen
this ain't magic, this is fabric
and it's the type that never requires patches
and it's the fire that illustrates with ashes
it's our life, it's nothing we can't manage
lower the arrow and take a breath
i won't waste ammo aiming at the angel of death
i might have already left, but they hear me still
with my pale knuckle grip on a steering wheel


i still hear your voice when you sleep next to me
i still feel your touch in my dream
forgive me, my weakness, but i don't know why
without you, it's hard to survive

'cause everytime we touch, i get this feeling
and everytime we kiss, i swear i could fly
can't you feel my heart beat fast? i want this to last
need you by my side
'cause everytime we touch, i feel the static
and everytime we kiss, i reach for the sky
can't you hear my heart beat so? i can't let you go
want you in my life


your arms are my castle, your heart is my sky
they wipe away tears that i cry  that i cry 
the good and the bad times, we've been through them all
you make me rise when i fall

'cause everytime we touch, i get this feeling
and everytime we kiss, i swear i could fly
can't you feel my heart beat fast? i want this to last
need you by my side
'cause everytime we touch, i feel the static
and everytime we kiss, i reach for the sky
can't you hear my heart beat so? i can't let you go
want you in my life

you know you need someone
when the need's so strong
when they're gone you don't know how to go on
so the whole world is stuck in a moment
standing still until they come back
you accept that they've, got things to do
but sometimes in the end there's nothing left for you
if hurt is missing your baby
i've done too much of it lately

missing you so deep
long as i'm where you're going to
i'd wait forever and a day for you
i wait up, wait up for you

and even when we mad, and say we're through
deep inside you feel the same way i do
might as well turn around and just end this
cause it's harder trying to stay mad
i could tell you that you can't stay here
knowing just as soon as you disappear
that i'll be missing you baby
soon as you get up and you walk away

every minutes like an hour
every hours like a day
every day lasts forever
but what else am i gonna do
i'd wait forever and a day for you
i wait up, wait up
i can't eat, i can't sleep, what else could it be
missing you so deep
long as i'm where you're going to

i'd wait forever and a day for you
i wait up, wait up for you


i feel a cold flush going through my hair
and hey you know what
i don't even care
the time has passed me by
it's gone with the wind
it's all because the sun shined once again
now the party's on
everybody's there
and if you don't know anyone
you'll still meet some new friends
that's the way it is
when i have myself a drink
all because the sun shines once again

come along children
now we're going to have a little music
like old times

straight out the gate
this is our story we're scripting
our film, our glorious vision
our sound, our score that is written
in this sport, this division
my my, how the tournament's risen
shit, everybody wants to soar in an instant
everybody wants to be the lord of the ring wins
we laid dormant and listened
hit ignition, tore up the system
elevate, accelerate and demonstrate
live the dream and keep the horns to the mission
the formula's mixing to fire the
engine up and bring the force to the pistons
never say never whenever together we give and go
with the flow flipping like jordan and pippen
slam the points home
incite a roar to ignite the board
wipe the floor with the notes that we write
and hold down with a mic to strike a chord
and then they can hear that thunder with the hooves
when we come with the hunger of the wolves
they were warned and the red flag flew
and his crewed cracked through, it's the running of the bulls
today, we are together
whenever we come together
the writers write
the cameras roll
because together we got power
that's just rappin'

i said
ay yo, i'mma
lay my tracks down, i'm that
freight train tearing through the
sky in the clouds, i said
ay yo, watch this
hail mary fly, keep on
runnin' keep on gunnin' with this
fire in my eyes, and i'm
sky high
i'm sky high, yeah  yeah, together 
welcome to the time of my life  raise your fists high 
i'm sky high
i'm sky high, yeah  together 
welcome to the time of my life

sun, rain, snow or hail
we never got lost in the storm
and you best to respect that you
never really know what you've got till it's gone
and a monster was born
with a want to explore
life's roughest weather
but we know the code so we stuck together, yeah
 yeah, yeah 
and as life unravels
my mind's what fights my battles
i rhyme like lightning travels
think quick, how you like them apples
cuz i'm ready as i'll ever be, my head is in the
melody, i'm flying now each
feather is so heavenly, the energy of seven
seas couldn't tie me down, bitch
so no fucking around dumb
cunt, one jump and i'm up in the clouds
trying to make that moment last
on a beat like heath in a joker mask
which means, don't change that dial
could've, would've, should've, just ain't our style
shit, we got things to build
if your luck's low just know your wings are real

criminal enterprises that
surrounded me, innocent, no

past, i don't brag, no faking

that's when biz mark came with the vapours

of the city that never sleeps

our experiences determine the texture, the pace, and the sound of our soul. all of us are one people singing our music, pumping our thing up, and doing our thing. let's give ourselves a great round of applause


since day one i said fuck the fame and everything it dealt
but the fame is really here just to facilitate the wealth
but the wealth attracts you haters like mosquitos to a well
and the waters getting deeper so i must set out to sail
someone called my cell, and left a voicemail
they said congratulations on the million record sales
as i'm flippin over furniture, knockin' shit off the shelf
i told myself i'd never get too deep to take a breath but i'm sinkin

and it's so hard to breathe, yeah
and even more so to sleep when no one cares
it was all i could need
but now i'm sinking, so deep, i can't come up for air

yeah, i've seen the valley of the shadow of death
i've seen the mountains, a wild childhood
that's why i sing about it
i just try to move on and keep my peace about it
but come to think about it i can't even count the days
that i spent starvin' tryin' to find a some decent housing
it's why i'm always smiling but on this beat i seem so violent
so ask me about the music scene and what the fuck i think about it
time flies i guess that's why i'm buggin
just yesterday i was rappin with my brother and my cousin
if you had the stove or toaster on you couldn't use the oven
we knew that we were struggling we just actin like we wasn't
it was either make it rapping, if not that then hustling
so all i see is magazine covers in this game
you either surface or you plummet
it's a thin line and i'm just tryin to keep my head above it, damn

and it's so hard to breathe, yeah
and even more so to sleep when no one cares
it was all i could need
but now i'm sinking, so deep, i can't come up for air
air i  i sink away 
air  i sink away 
air  as i sink away  i  damn i sink away 
damn air damn pots and pans
get carried away damn get carried away it
was never in the plans
but hey, it's long way from beatin' pots and pans

and it's so hard to breathe, yeah
and even more so to sleep when no one cares
it was all i could need
but now i'm sinking, so deep, i can't come up for air
damn it was never in the plans
but hey, it's a long way from beatin' pots and pans
but now i'm sinking so deep i can't come up for air, air, ah


nigga, you need to git up, git out and git something
don't let the days of your life pass by
you need to git up, git out and git something
don't spend all your time tryna get high
you need git up, git out and git something
how will you make it if you never even try?
you need to git up, git out and git something
cause you and i got to do for you and i

i don't recall, ever graduating at all
sometimes i feel i'm just a disappointment to y'all
every day i just lay around then i can't be found
always asking "gimme some," living life like a bum
times is rough, my auntie got enough problems of her own
nigga, you supposed to be grown
i agree, i try to be the man i'm 'posed to be
but negativity is all you seem to ever see
i admit, i've done some dumb shit, and i'm probably gon' do some mo'
you shouldn't hold that against me though
 why not?  why not? my music's all that i got
but some time must be invested for this to be manifested
i know you know but i'm gon' say this to you, i
get high but i don't get too high
so what's the limit 'posed to be?

you act as though you know something i don't, do you have any suggestions?
cause every job i get is cruel and demeaning
sick of taking trash out and toilet bowl cleaning
but i'm also sick and tired of struggling
i never ever thought i'd to have resort to drug smuggling
naw, that ain't what i'm about
cee lo will just continue traveling his route
without any doubt or fear
i know the lord ain't brought me this far so he could drop me off here

my mama made me do it but the devil, he made me smart
told me to jack them weak ass niggas for they fucking starters
in the middle school, i was a bigger fool
i wore with tank tops to show off my tattoo, thought i was cool
i used to hang out with my daddy's brothers, i call them my uncles
they taught me how to smoke herb, i followed them when they ran numbers
so in a sense, i was rosemary's baby
and then i learned the difference between a bitch and a lady
hell, i treat 'em all like hoes, see i pimped 'em
bitch never had my money so i never whipped 'em
see all the playas came and all the playas went
a playa ain't a gangsta but a playa can handle his shit, bitch
you need to git up, git out, git something
smoke out cause it's all about money, money, money
yeah i said it, a nigga sporting plaits and a braves hat
i hang with rico wade cause the dungeon is where the funk's at, boy
i'm true to organized cause they raised me
i'm also down with laface cause l.a. reid, yeah, he pays me
and it's cool, yeah it's real cool getting paid fat pockets
and all that other fat shit like that, ha ha 

you need to git up, git out and git something
don't let the days of your life pass by
you need to git up, git out and git something
don't spend all your time tryna get high, nigga
you need git up, git out and git something
how will you make it if you never even try?
you need to git up, git out and git something
cause you and i got to do for you and i
that's why

a lot of people in my past tried to do me, screw me
throw me over in the fire, let me get chunky and charred
like a piece of wood and them spirits got the mutant's mind
i'm getting paranoid and steady looking for the time
it's eight in the morning and ain't nobody up yet
i got my long johns, get my coat and throw on my ball cap
i'm headed out the door, to get off in my ride
i'm digging through the ashtray, hoping to have a good day
i had jamaica's best and when i light it up, i hear a voice in my head
 you got to git up, git out and git something 
now i know it's on, my day is finally started
back up in my crib, eat my shit, break out quick, in my slick
'84 sedan deville, steady bouncing
out the point to campbellton road
the valley of the southside flow
everybody know about that killa that we call blow, so
keep your eyes peeled for the cobra unit
cause they known for jumping out of black chevy trucks and through the fog
here come the red dogs, i'm busting out around the corner in my hog
dipping from the area, i'm scared
so one of these bitches might wind up dead, cause i have no time for jail
fuck clampett cops, fuck elgin bell
and crooked ass jackson, got the whole country
thinking that my city is the big lick for '96
'94, big gipp, goodie mo
outkast, a vision from the past
hootie hoo 
my white owls are burning kind of slow

you need to git up, git out and git something
don't let the days of your life pass by
you need to git up, git out and git something
don't spend all your time tryna get high nigga
you need git up, git out and git something
how will you make it if you never even try?
you need to git up, git out and git something
cause you and i got to do for you and i
that's why

y'all telling me that i need to get out and vote, huh, why?
ain't nobody black running but crac kers, so, why
i got to register? i thinking of better shit to do with my time
never smelled aroma of diploma, but i write the deep ass rhymes
so let me take y'all way
back to when a nigga stayed in southwest atlanta, ay
y'all could not tell me nothing, thought i hit that bottom rock
at age 13, start working at the loading dock
they laying my mama off of work, general motors tripping
but i come home banked like hank, from licking and dipping
doing dumb shit, not knowing what a nigga know now
yeah, that petty shit will have you cased up and locked down
i dips, over to east point still actin' a fool
wasting my time in the school, i'd rather be shooting pool
cool is how i played the tenth grade
i thought it was all about macking hoes and wearing pimp fade
instead of being in class, i'd rather be up in some ass
not thinking about them six courses that i need to pass
graduation rolled around like rolly pollies
damn, that's fucked up, i should've listened when my mama told me
that, if you play now, you gonna suffer later
figured she was talking yang yang so i payed her no attention
and kept missing the point she tried to poke me with
the doper that i get, the more i'm feeling broke as shit
huh, but that don't matter though, i am an o u t kast
so get up off your ass

you need to git up, git out and git something
don't let the days of your life pass by
you need to git up, git out and git something
don't spend all your time tryna get high
you need git up, git out and git something

and her becoming my everything
i'm at war with my wrongs, i'm writing four different songs
i never forged it or forfeited, i'm a force to be reconciled
they want four minute songs
you need a four hour praise dance performed every morn

hit jericho with a buzzer beater to end a quarter
watch brick and mortar fall like dripping water, ugh

to be a soldier, must maintain composure at ease
though life is complicated, only what you make it to be
uh, and my ambitions as a ridah
to catch her while she hot and horny, go up inside her
then i spit some game in her ear, "go to the telly, ho "
equipped with money in a benz 'cause, bitch, i'm barely broke
i'm smokin' bomb ass weed, feelin' crucial
from player to player, the game's tight, the feeling's mutual
from hustlin' and prayers to breakin' motherfuckers to pay up
i got no time for these bitches, 'cause these hoes try to play us
i'm on a meal ticket mission, want a mil' so i'm wishin'

i'm innocent so there'll be bullets flyin' when i'm caught  shoot 
fuck doin' jail time, better day, sacrifice
won't get a chance to do me like they did my nigga tys
thuggin' for life, and if you right, then nigga die for it
let them other brothers try, at least you tried for it
when it's time to die, to be a man and pick the way you leave
fuck peace and the police, my ambitions as a ridah

i won't deny it, i'm a straight ridah
you don't wanna fuck with me
 my ambitions as a ridah 
got the police bustin' at me
but they can't do nothin' to a g

my murderous lyrics, equipped with spirits of the thugs before me
pay off the block, evade the cops 'cause i know they comin' for me
i been hesitant to reappear, been away for years
now i'm back, my adversaries been reduced to tears
question my methods to switch up speeds
sure as some bitches bleed
niggas'll feel the fire of my mother's corrupted seed
blast me but they didn't finish, didn't diminish my powers
 buck buck buck buck buck 
so now i'm back to be a motherfuckin' menace
they cowards, that's why they tried to set me up
had bitch ass niggas on my team so indeed they wet me up
but i'm back reincarnated, incarcerated
at the time i contemplate the way that god made it
lace 'em with lyrics that's legendary, musical mercenary
for money i'll have these motherfuckers buried
i been gettin' much mail in jail, niggas tellin' me to kill it
knowin' when i get out they gon' feel it
witness the realest, a hoo ridah when i put the shit inside

ayo, black, it's time, word  word, it's time, man 
it's time, man  aight, man, begin 
yeah, straight out the fuckin' dungeons of rap
where fake niggas don't make it back
i don't know how to start this shit, yo... now

rappers   i monkey flip 'em with the funky rhythm i be kickin'
musician, inflictin', composition
of pain, i'm like scarface sniffin' cocaine
holdin' an m16, see with the pen i'm extreme
now, bullet holes left in my peepholes
i'm suited up in street clothes, hand me a 9 and i'll defeat foes
y'all know my steelo, with or without the airplay
i keep some e j, sittin' bent up in the stairway
or either on the corner bettin' grants with the cee lo champs
laughin' at base heads, tryna sell some broken amps...
g packs get off quick, forever niggas talk shit
reminiscin' about the last time the task force flipped
niggas be runnin' through the block shootin'
time to start the revolution, catch a body, head for houston
once they caught us off guard, the mac 10 was in the grass, and
i ran like a cheetah, with thoughts of an assassin
picked the mac up, told brothers "back up "   the mac spit
lead was hittin' niggas, one ran, i made him backflip
heard a few chicks scream, my arm shook, couldn't look
gave another squeeze, heard it click, "yo, my shit is stuck "
tried to cock it, it wouldn't shoot, now i'm in danger
finally pulled it back and saw 3 bullets caught up in the chamber
so, now i'm jettin' through the buildin' lobby
and it was full of children, prob'ly couldn't see as high as i be
 so, what you sayin'? 
it's like the game ain't the same
got younger niggas pullin' the triggers, bringin' fame to their name
and claim some corners, crews without guns are goners
in broad daylight, stick up kids, they run up on us
0.45 s and gauges, mac's in fact
same niggas will catch you back to back, snatchin' your cracks in black
there was a snitch on the block gettin' niggas knocked
so hold your stash 'til the coke price drop
i know this crackhead who said she got to smoke nice rock
and if it's good she'll bring you customers and measuring pots, but yo
you gotta slide on a vacation
inside information keeps large niggas erasin' and their wives basin'
it drops deep as it does in my breath
i never sleep, 'cause sleep is the cousin of death
beyond the walls of intelligence, life is defined
i think of crime when i'm in the new york state of mind

new york state of mind
new york state of mind
new york state of mind

be havin' dreams that i'm a gangsta, drinkin' mo ts, holdin' tec's
makin' sure the cash came correct, then i stepped
investments in stocks, sewin' up the blocks to sell rocks
winnin' gunfights with mega cops
but just a nigga walkin' with his finger on the trigger
make enough figures until my pockets get bigger
i ain't the type of brother made for you to start testin'
give me a smith   wesson, i have niggas undressin'
thinkin' of cash flow, buddha and shelter
whenever frustrated, i'ma hijack delta
in the pj's, my blend tape plays, bullets are strays
young bitches is grazed, each block is like a maze
full of black rats trapped plus the island is packed
from what i hear in all the stories when my peoples come back
black, i'm livin' where the nights is jet black
the fiends fight to get crack, i just max, i dream i can sit back
and lamp like capone, with drug scripts sewn
or the legal luxury life, rings flooded with stones, homes
i got so many rhymes, i don't think i'm too sane
life is parallel to hell, but i must maintain
and be prosperous, though we live dangerous
cops could just arrest me, blamin' us: we're held like hostages
it's only right that i was born to use mics
and the stuff that i write is even tougher than dykes
i've taken rappers to a new plateau
through rap slow, my rhymin' is a vitamin held without a capsule
the smooth criminal on beat breaks
never put me in your box if your shit eats tapes
the city never sleeps, full of villains and creeps
that's where i learned to do my hustle, had to scuffle with freaks
i'm a addict for sneakers, 20s of buddha and bitches with beepers
in the streets i can greet ya, about blunts i teach ya
inhale deep like the words of my breath
i never sleep 'cause sleep is the cousin of death
i lay puzzle as i backtrack to earlier times
nothing's equivalent to the new york state of mind

new york state of mind
new york state of mind
new york state of mind
new york state of mind

you can be my mama and i'll be your boy

original rude boy, never am i coy
you can be a shorty in my ill convoy
not to come across as a thug or a hood
but hon, you got the goods, like madelyne woods
by the way, my name's malik
the five foot freak
let's say we get together by the end of the week
she simply said, "no", labelled me a ho
i said, "how you figure?" "my friends told me so"
i hate when silly groupies wanna run they yap
word to god, hon, i don't get down like that

i'll have you weak in the knees that you could hardly speak
or we could do like uncle l and swing an ep in my jeep
keep it on the down, yo, we keep it discreet

maybe this the album you listen to in your car
when you driving home late at night
really questioning every god, religion, kanye, bitches
maybe this is the entrance before you get to the river
a heaven before the heathen no reason for you to like me
maybe this your wifey just wanting a clean divorce
the baby ain't really yours, this really for babies teething
and chicken wings under seasoned
y'all really thought a bitch couldn't rap huh?
maybe this your answer for that, a crack era
the reagan administration that niggas are still scared of
nah actually this is for me
this one for tt at the lake serving the mac and the cheese
this one a small apology for all the calls that i screened

mr. money man, mr. every day he got me
mr. wifing me down, mr. me love, mr. miyagi
miscellaneous, mr. molly inside my sake
incredible, incredible emptiness in my body
heaven's only four feet tall, i set my ringer to it
fucked your rapper homie, now his ass is making better music
my pussy teachin ninth grade english
my pussy wrote a thesis on colonialism
in conversation with a marginal system in love with jesus
and y'all still thought a bitch couldn't rap huh?
maybe this your answer for that good pussy
i know niggas only talk about money and good pussy



envisioning the hereafter, listening to steve wonder
on a quest for love like the proceed drummer
i strike like lightning and don't need thunder
inhale imagination and breathe wonder
that's your lady, i used to run up in her and g weed from her
it's a cold world and niggas need summer
at times my going forward seems like retreat
as i rewrite rhyme after rhyme and throw away beats
growing into my britches, outgrowing the streets
there's a thin line between war and peace, whores and jeeps
ignore mcs like beeps, scribbling freedom on pages
my third eye is like pink eye, seen and contagious
redeeming the ancients with ageless rhyme jargon
i feel mexican, hip hop is my garden
don't give a fuck where you charting, certain shit i can't honor
it ain't that you selling, it's your karma
rappers i monitor like a chaperone, you large and haven't grown
poetically perform live bys, another rapper gone
the stage becomes a catacomb, i rap like a mummy
not for the money, i could have sampled diana ross a long time ago
my mind of flow is like motor key 20
youngblood said he had dimes, i prayed that he see twenty
hollering at the brothers, either you gon' be a thug or a man
flip drugs and get land
i can see my man was tired as he described how the bucks hit him
and said slugs was still stuck in him, when it rained, it fucked with him
this bucket interrupt wisdom and asked when my album was coming
i said it's here, it's here...

i'm hardly touched, i've got an army though
they'll rain on, how'd you think your got your chain on

better switch your brain on, you can see i'm way gone
look back the game's gone, you got caught up in
stormy weather  eskiboy 
 roll deep 

that's why i'm a grafter, the tai chi master
don't know now you will realize after
i've made my mark with permanent marker
i've made history like the spanish armada
you can't say that my style ain't harder, hot like nevada
i ain't dead like the wiley and lethal saga, nah, i'm a leader

you crew won't manage but wait, don't panic
go home and tell yourself you won't have it

f the western, f the system, i don't care
i've got my own system, are you listening?
the weather won't change, there will always be some
stormy weather

that shines brighter, the east side rider
hyper like kitchen micra
it's a shame how people ain't tighter
we can be a powerful team so what we doin' then?
everybody tighter, gotta be a fighter
i came from the drain so, if you come from there
then, push up your lighter
look, there he goes, it's e3 boy
it's the second phaze, more p's for the boy
you're never gonna take no g's from the boy
'cause he ain't one of them boys, believe in the boy
there ain't no chief in the boy
he's got a lot of anger inside to release on a boy
that hates him for the wrong reason
can't get along with the boy, don't chat to the boy


oh, yeah

like a movie scene
in the sweetest dreams
i have pictured us together
now to feel your lips
on my fingertips
i have to say is even better
than i ever thought it could possibly be
it's perfect, it's passion, it's setting me free
from all of my sadness, the tears that i've cried
i have spent all of my life

waiting for tonight, oh
when you would be here in my arms
waiting for tonight, oh oh
i've dreamed of this love for so long
waiting for tonight
oh oh, oh oh oh

take my breath away
love me now and leave me never
found a sacred place
lost in your embrace
i want to stay in this forever
i think of the days when the sun used to set
on my empty heart, all alone in my bed
tossing and turning, emotions were strong
i knew i had to hold on

waiting for tonight, oh
when you would be here in my arms
waiting for tonight, oh oh
i've dreamed of this love for so long
waiting for tonight, oh

they say i'm better off now than i ever was with her
as they take me to my local down the street
i'm smiling but i'm dying trying not to drag my feet

they say a few drinks will help me to forget her
but after one too many, i know that i'm never
only they can't see where this is gonna end
they all think i'm crazy but to me it's perfect sense

and my mates are all there trying to calm me down
'cause i'm shouting your name all over the town
i'm swearing if i go there now
i can change her mind, turn it all around
and i know that i'm drunk but i'll say the words
and she'll listen this time even though they're slurred
so i dialed her number and confessed to her
i'm still in love but all i heard was nothing

so i stumble there, along the railings and the fences
i know if i faced her face, that she'll come to her senses
every drunk step i take leads me to her door
if she sees how much i'm hurting, she'll take me back for sure

and my mates are all there trying to calm me down
'cause i'm shouting your name all over the town
i'm swearing if i go there now
i can change her mind, turn it all around
and i know that i'm drunk but i'll say the words
and she'll listen this time even though they're slurred
so i dialed her number and confessed to her
i'm still in love but all i heard was nothing

she said nothing
oh, i wanted words but all i heard was nothing
oh, i got nothing
i got nothing
oh, i wanted words but all i heard was nothing

ohh, sometimes love's intoxicating
ohh, you're coming down, your hands are shaking
when you realize there's no one waiting

am i better off dead? am i better off a quitter?
they say i'm better off now than i ever was with her

and my mates are all there trying to calm me down
'cause i'm shouting your name all over the town
i'm swearing if i go there now
i can change her mind, turn it all around
and i know that i'm drunk but i'll say the words
and she'll listen this time even though they're slurred
so i dialed her number and confessed to her
i'm still in love but all i heard was nothing

she said nothing
oh, i wanted words but all i heard was nothing
oh, i got nothing
i got nothing
oh, i wanted words but all i heard was nothing
ohh i got nothing

 i got nothing 
i got nothing
i got nothing

i drop 50 bars, mad bars, raised the bar twice
the bars are on me all night
if they wanna go bar for bar we can do it on sight
i'm a beast, you're gonna never see me lose a bar fight

everyone got an opinion but they won't step up
can do a fucking handstand still got no leg up
so go ahead, talk your shit, yo, come on get tough
i'll instagram a dick pic, you could all get fucked
i'm still as sick as a malaria patient, i'm very impatient
stomping up the stairs of the basement  i'm coming 
no hibernation, yo, this bear is awakened
and half the game be softer than what ben and jerry are making
i'm a transcendentalist with literary arrangements
vocabulary is like a dictionary replacement
but they only talking money and they last time i was checking
the greater percentage of america is in a recession  hold up   what 
so what you're sayin' is these diamond crusted necklaces
and convoluted messages is really what you're messing with
where's the dope shit what happened to that
back when people stepped up to the mic and actually rapped
but now i'm on it, been here for a minute, and now i'm back to get them
had this devil on my shoulder during catechism
staying high from the purple and the hash i'm hitting
brain moving slower than rick ross' metabolism
i'm here to rap a rhythm, so why you saying shit  why 
so many fucking punch lines, i'm about to break my wrist
undefeated, yo, i'm hard to be playing with
i'm the king, alter alias is marcus aurelius
killing beats, murder scene, and i'm washing my hands carefully
scrubbing all the blood out the trunk of the grand cherokee
in need of therapy but the doctor's scared of me
says i need a trip to shutter island cuz apparently
i've lost my damn mind,yo, i'm sick in the head
the reason women say that chivalry's dead
i'm that guy, trying to find some company laying in misery's bed
staying blunted with a fifth to the head
judge dredd with a weapon now, laser beam flow bout to blast that
mother fucking lyricist, you can hashtag that
freestyle crazy, they like; "yo, how he rap that?"
so hot off the top, i'll melt the plastic in my snapback
in a hatchback running people over till your body parts are stuck in my motor
never sober, i got to charge my g pen like 12 times every weekend
sharks and minnows with it always treading in the deep end, shit who needs friends
i got my headphones, an ipod, rhyme book and a pen, homes
shit, i even got bars in a dead zone
i get it crackin' like chiropractors with neck bones
shit, i been slept on, way too fucking long now
studied every fork in the road taking the long route  yes sir 
mapped it out like cartography, build my bridges strong
and now i know that anyone that stomps at me will tremble in my hands
run them off my lands, see i always stuck it to the man
fuck it, cuz i can, bringing out the ruckus is my plan
puffing on a gram, if you want some trouble i'm your man
comfortably stand right where i'm at
soon to be legend, ain't no fighting the facts
about to rise to be a mother fucking titan of rap
give them pieces of my soul and put my life in a track
in the game where people quick to put that knife in your back
gotta teach yourself to move like a wolf or get preyed on
fuck blowing up the real challenge is to stay on
you must be fucking stupid if you take on
this crazy white boy, keep my game face on
and my shades on, and my brim low, and my mind right
cooking up a sick flow, chewing through my leash, now see the kid go
because now we here bitch, welcome to the show



tell my momma i'm a shaman rhymin'
jesus christ and shawn carter are my only idols
no, jesus christ and shawn carter are my only rivals
i'm the messiah of rap, my catalog's the bible
to the new generation of lost souls
student loans, iphones, reality tv shows
it shows a host of wise, but blind drones
post babylonia, so i'm told
it could be bologna, so i don't hold it to be fact
just tryna put the pieces together, puzzled by this madness
if that dollar crashes, niggas gone panic, what we gon' do?
how we gon eat? don't even know how to grow fruit detached from your roots, nigga, me too
i'm doing drugs, fornicating and eating fast food
but i know i got three eyes cause i'm looking past you

enter the void
this for my hundred dollar billers to destroy
spreading word of knowledge to through decoys
people realize that it's time to deploy
stay on point: open your third eye, boy
 and keep your motherfucking chakras open
keep your motherfucking chakras open
keep your mouth shut and keep your motherfucking chakras open
keep your all seeing eye open 

had to escape nest, told moms i'm apex
and plus i lay checks, i bust in the latex
so it's nothing stopping the kid if you get where i come from
busting conundrums on nuns and condoms
don't want no problems, it's the number one solver
can't see me with these sentences, get your bars up
i'm close to the pen, i depend on this shit
ain't tryna be dead bent, i'll ascend off this spliff
you can't pretend with this shit
see, i know what's real and what isn't
ain't shit obscured with my vision, plus the herbs that i'm hittin'
allow me to observe what is hidden
could have been a cherry pickin' nigga
if i ain't make jams and bury niggas
used to be the sweetest 'til life handed me the lemons, nigga
now everyday i see the sour patches
the flower of life devoured into ashes

enter the void
this for my hundred dollar billers to destroy
spreading word of knowledge to through decoys
people realize that it's time to deploy
stay on point: open your third eye, boy
 and keep your motherfucking chakras open
keep your motherfucking chakras open
keep your mouth shut and keep your motherfucking chakras open
keep your all seeing eye open

smokin' weed in bambú, sippin' on private stock
way back, when i had the red and black lumberjack
with the hat to match
remember rappin' duke? duh ha, duh ha

sold out seats to hear biggie smalls speak
living life without fear
puttin' five karats in my baby girl ear

stereotypes of a black male misunderstood
and it's still all good

he greets his father with his hands out
rehabilitated slightly, but glad to be the man's child
the world is different since he's seen it last
out of jail, been seven years and he's happy that he's free at last
all he had was his mother's letters
now he's mobile and he's gotta make a change and make it for the better
but he's black so he's got one strike against him
and he's young, plus he came up in the system
but he's smart and he's finally making eighteen
and his goal's to get on top and try to stay clean
so he's calling up his homie who done came up
livin' lavish, now they dealin' with the same stuff
and had that attitude that who he was was worth land
and with that fucked up attitude he killed his first man
now it's different, he done did dirt
and realized killin' men meant comin' up but it still hurt
and can't nobody change this
it's 1994 and we up against the same shit
i never understood why
i could never see a man cry 'til i seen a man die

imagine life at it's full peak
then imagine lying dead in the arms of your enemy
imagine peace on this earth when there's no grief
imagine grief on this earth when there's no peace
everybody's got a different way of endin' it
and when your number comes for souls, then they send it in
now your time has arrived for your final test
i see the fear in your eyes and hear your final breath
how much longer will it be 'til it's all done?
total darkness at ease be at all one
i watch him die and when he dies let us celebrate
you took his life, but your memory you'll never take
you'll be headed to another place
and the life you used to live will reflect in your mother's face
i still gotta wonder why
i never seen a man cry 'til i seen a man die

i hear you breathin' but your heart no longer sounds strong
but you kinda scared of dying so you hold on
and you keep on blacking out and your pulse is low
stop trying to fight the reaper, just relax and let it go
because there's no way you can fight it though you'll still try
and you can try it 'til you fight it but you'll still die
your spirits leave your body and your mind clears
the rigor mortis starts to set, now you outta here
you start your journey into outer space
you see yourself in the light but you're still feeling outta place
so you standing in the tunnel of eternal life
and you see the ones you never learn to love in life
make the choice, let it go if you can back it up
if you ain't at peace with god you need to patch it up
but if you ready, close your eyes and we can set it free
here lies a man not scared to die, may he rest in peace
i still got to wonder why
i never seen a man cry 'til i seen that man die

 right  right  
check me out y'all
nasty nas in your area
about to cause mass hysteria

before a blunt, i take out my fronts
then i start to front, matter of fact i be on a manhunt
you couldn't catch me in the streets without a ton of reefer
that's like malcolm x catchin' the jungle fever
king poetic, too much flavor, i'm major
atlanta ain't brave r, i'll pull a number like a pager
 cause i'm an ace when i face the bass
40 side is the place that is givin' me grace
now wait, another dose and you might be dead
and i'm a nike head, i wear chains that excite the feds
and ain't a damn thing gonna change, i'm a performer, strange
so the mic warmer was born to gain
nas, why did you do it?
you know you got the mad phat fluid when you rhyme
it's halftime

 right   it's halftime
 right   ayo it's halftime
 right   it's halftime
 right   yeah, it's about halftime
this is how it feel, check it out, how it feel

it's like that, you know it's like that
i got it hemmed, now you never get the mic back
when i attack, there ain't a army that could strike back
so i react never calmly on a hype track
i set it off with my own rhyme
 cause i'm as ill as a convict who kills for phone time
i'm max like cassettes, i flex like sex
in your stereo sets, nas'll catch wreck
i used to hustle, now all i do is relax and strive
when i was young i was a fan of the jackson 5
i drop jewels, wear jewels, hope to never run it
with more kicks than a baby in a mother's stomach
nasty nas has to rise  cause i'm wise
this is exercise 'til the microphone dies
back in '83 i was an mc sparkin'
but i was too scared to grab the mics in the parks and
kick my little raps  cause i thought niggas wouldn't understand
and now in every jam i'm the fuckin' man
i rap in front of more niggas than in the slave ships
i used to watch "chips", now i load glock clips
i got to have it, i miss mr. magic
versatile, my style switches like a faggot
but not bisexual, i'm an intellectual
of rap i'm a professional, and that's no question yo
these are the lyrics of the man, you can't near it, understand?
 cause in the streets i'm well known like the number man
am i in place with the bass and format?
explore rap and tell me, "nas ain't all that."
and next time i rhyme, i be foul
whenever i freestyle i see trial, niggas say i'm wild
i hate a rhyme biter's rhyme
stay tuned, i assume, the real rap comes at halftime

 right   it's halftime
 right   exhale, check it, it's halftime
 right   it's halftime
 right   it's real in the field
word life, check it

i got it goin' on, even flip a morning song
every afternoon, i kick half the tune
and in the darkness i'm heartless like when the narc's hit
word to marcus garvey, i hardly sparked it
 cause when i blast the herb, that's my word
i be slayin' them fast, doin' this that and the third
but chill, pass the andre, and let's slay
i bag bitches up at john jay and hit a matinee
puttin' hits on 5 0
 cause when it's my time to go, i wait for god with the .44
and biters can't come near
and yo, go to hell to the foul cop who shot garcia
i won't plant seeds, don't need an extra mouth i can't feed
that's extra phillie change, more cash for damp weed
this goes out to manhattan, the island of staten
brooklyn and queens is livin' fat and
the boogie down, enough props, enough clout
ill will, rest in peace, yo i'm out

 right   it's still halftime
 right   to the queensbridge crew
to the queensbridge crew, you know it's halftime
 right   ninety two, it's halftime
 right   yo police, police man, yo let's get ghost
halftime

we used to be number 10, now we're permanent one
in the battle lost my finger, mic became my arm
pistol nozzle hits your nasal, blood becomes lukewarm
tell the woman be easy naah squeeze the charmin
test wyclef, see death flesh get scorned
beat you so bad make you feel like you ain't wanna be born jawn
and tell your friends stay the hell out of my lawn
chicken george became dead george stealing chickens from my farm
damn, another dead pigeon;
if you're mafiosos then i'm bringing on haitian sicilians
nobody's shooting, my body's made of hand grenade
girl bled to death while she was tongue kissing a razor blade
that sounds sick maybe one day i'll write a horror;
blackula comes to the ghetto, jacks an acura
stevie wonder sees crack babies
becoming enemies of their own families 
armageddon come you know we soon done
gun by my side just in case i gotta rump
a boy on the side of babylon
trying to front like he's down with mount zion

i sit 90 degrees underneath palm trees
smoking beedi as i burn my calories
brooklyn roof tops become brooklyn tee pees
who that be, enemies, wanna see the death of me
from hawaii to  hawthorne, i run marathons, like
buju banton, i'm a true champion, like
farrakhan reads his daily qur'an
it's a phenomenon, lyrics fast like ramadan

a dedication to all the refugees worldwide
one time, say, say, say

i remember when we used to sit
in the government yard in brooklyn
observing the crookedness
as it mingled with the good people we meet
good friends we had, good friends we've lost along the way
in this great future you can't forget your past
so dry your tears, i say
and to my peeps who passed away

no woman, no cry
no woman, no cry, say, say, say
hey, little sister, don't shed no tears
no woman, no cry, say, say, say

i remember when we used to rock
in a project yard in jersey
and little georgie would make the firelight
as stolen cars passed through the night
and then we'd hit the corner store for roots, paper, and brew
my drink's my only remedy for pain of losing family
but while i'm gone shorty

everything is gonna be alright
everything is gonna be alright
fugees come to the dance tonight
everything is gonna be alright
everything is gonna be alright
everything is gonna be alright
the gun man's in the house tonight
but everything is gonna be alright

observing the hypocrites
as they mingled with the good people we meet
good friends we had, oh, good friends we've lost along the way, hey
in this great future you can't forget your past
so dry your tears i say

no woman, no cry
no woman, no cry, say, say, say

my ambitions as a ridah
my ambitions as a ridah

so many battlefield scars while driven in plush cars
this life as a rap star is nothin' without guard
was born rough and rugged, addressin' the mass public
my attitude was "fuck it," 'cause motherfuckers love it
to be a soldier, must maintain composure at ease
though life is complicated, only what you make it to be
uh, and my ambitions as a ridah
to catch her while she hot and horny, go up inside her
then i spit some game in her ear, "go to the telly, ho "
equipped with money in a benz 'cause, bitch, i'm barely broke
i'm smokin' bomb ass weed, feelin' crucial
from player to player, the game's tight, the feeling's mutual
from hustlin' and prayers to breakin' motherfuckers to pay up
i got no time for these bitches, 'cause these hoes try to play us
i'm on a meal ticket mission, want a mil' so i'm wishin'
competition got me ripped on that bullshit they stressin'  booyah 
i'ma rhyme though, clown hoes like it's mandatory
no guts, no glory, my nigga, bitch got the game distorted
now it's on and it's on because i said so
can't trust a bitch in the business so i got with death row
now these money hungry bitches gettin' suspicious
started plottin' and plannin' on a scheme to come and twist us
but thug niggas be on point and game tight  yeah

'cause deep in the hearts they wanna be me

when it's time to ride, i was the first off this side, give me the 9
i'm ready to die right here tonight and motherfuck they life
that's what they screamin' as they drill me, but i'm hard to kill
so open fire, i see you kill me, witness my steel

spittin' at adversaries, envious and after me
i'd rather die before they capture me, watch me bleed
mama, come rescue me, i'm suicidal, thinkin' thoughts
i'm innocent so there'll be bullets flyin' when i'm caught  shoot 
fuck doin' jail time, better day, sacrifice
won't get a chance to do me like they did my nigga tys
thuggin' for life, and if you right, then nigga die for it
let them other brothers try, at least you tried for it
when it's time to die, to be a man and pick the way you leave
fuck peace and the police, my ambitions as a ridah

i won't deny it, i'm a straight ridah
you don't wanna fuck with me
 my ambitions as a ridah 
got the police bustin' at me
but they can't do nothin' to a g

my murderous lyrics, equipped with spirits of the thugs before me
pay off the block, evade the cops 'cause i know they comin' for me
i been hesitant to reappear, been away for years
now i'm back, my adversaries been reduced to tears
question my methods to switch up speeds
sure as some bitches bleed
niggas'll feel the fire of my mother's corrupted seed
blast me but they didn't finish, didn't diminish my powers
 buck buck buck buck buck 
so now i'm back to be a motherfuckin' menace
they cowards, that's why they tried to set me up
had bitch ass niggas on my team so indeed they wet me up
but i'm back reincarnated, incarcerated
at the time i contemplate the way that god made it
lace 'em with lyrics that's legendary, musical mercenary
for money i'll have these motherfuckers buried
i been gettin' much mail in jail, niggas tellin' me to kill it
knowin' when i get out they gon' feel it
witness the realest, a hoo ridah when i put the shit inside
the cry from all your people when they find ya
just remind ya, my history'll prove authentic
revenge on them niggas that played me
and all the cowards that was down with it

we takin' what's yours, we do jux, rush the doors
here come the d's, time to make breeze and gun toss
in full force, my team'll go at your main source
my 9 taurus hit bosses and take hostage
your whole setup, from the ground up, we lock shit
blood flood your eye, fuck up your optics
switch to killer instincts for niggas pop shit
yo, nigga noyd, what's the topic? nine pound we rocked in
'96 strike back with more hot shit
illuminate, my team'll glow like radiation
with no time for patient or complication, let's get it
done right, my clique airtight, trapped in a
never ending gunfight so niggas lose stripes or lose life
jail niggas sending kites to the street
over some beef that wasn't fully cooked, finish 'em off
well done meat, then send 22 slug to your head
travel all the way down to your leg

ayo, it's hell on earth, whose necks are gonna be first?
the projects is front line
and the enemy is one time, i ain't gotta tell you
it's right in front of your eyes
ayo, it's hell on earth, whose necks are gonna be first?
the projects is front line
and the enemy is one time, i ain't gotta tell you
yo, it's right in front of your eyes

we rep the qbc, nigga, rep yours, it's all love
milli stacked down, heavily guarded by hollow tip slug
then crack down on wannabe thugs, adapt to gat sound
and bow down, slow the fuck up, see how my foul now
articulate, hittin' body parts to start shiftin' shit
never hesitant, it's the rap game unlimited
sign my roster, we can do this, forever infinite
then reminisce, 20 years later how we was gettin' it
either with me, go against the grain, you better hit me
leggin' me or robbin' me, niggas better body me
 cause it's a small world, and niggas talkin' like bitches
bitches singin' like snitches, pointin' you out in pictures
 cause she rep the qbc faithfully, playa hatin' me
all that bullshit is just makin' me
more the better, then concentrate on gettin' cheddar
if shorty set you up, you better dead her, i told you
shape and mold you, son you, then i hold you
like a pimp, mind control you, double edge blow you
it'll be i like i'm supposed to, the clique is coastal
international, you local bacardi mix physically fix
hit you with shit that'll leave a loose nigga stiff
probably thick, son, i solved 'em
pulled him in my world then evolved him to chaos
walk the beat like, around the way cops the average pitstop
qb city godfather pt iii
gotti, gambino and ty nitty, scarface
rest in peace 

whose necks are gonna be first?
the projects is front line
and the enemy is one time, i ain't gotta tell you
ayo, it's right in front of your eyes
hell on earth, whose necks are gonna be first?
the projects is front line
and the enemy is one time, i ain't gotta tell you
ayo, it's right in front of your eyes

yo, the heavy metal king, hold big shit with spare clips
you see an eclipse when the mac spit, your top got split
layin' dead with open eyes, close his eyelids
turn off his lights, switch to darkness  cause deep in the abyss is
street life, blood on my kicks, shit on my knife
you's the wild child, kiko turnin' men into mice
i was born to take power, leave my mark on this planet
the phantom of crime rap, niggas is left stranded
shut down your operation, closed for business
leave a foul taste in your mouth like guinness
pow niggas is found mia
we move like special forces, green beret
heavily around my throat, i don't play
shit brand new, back in '89, the same way
the god p walk with a limp see, but simply
to simplify shit, no man can go against me
test me, you must be bent, g, don't tempt me
i had this full clip for so long, it needs to empty
the reason why it's full for so long  cause i don't waste shit
you properly hit, blood in your mouth, so you could taste it
quiet as kept, i lay back and watch the world spin
i hear thugs claimin' that they gonna rob the mobb when they
see us, i tell you what black, here's the issue, it's a
package deal, you rob me, you take these missiles
along with that, i ain't your average cat
fuck rap, i'm tryna make cream, and that's that
whatever it takes, however, it gots to go down
four mics on stage, a motherfuckin' four pound
speakers leakin' out sound and niggas leakin' on the ground
i could truly care less, the god gon' get his
regardless blow for blow, let's find out who wear hardest
this rap artist used to be a stickup artist
sometimes i test myself, see if i still got it
a live nigga stay on point, never diss
regard shit or forget the essence from which i emerged
p is sick, so save that bullshit for the birds
live up to my word, if i got beef, niggas comin' in herds
we flush through, your clique get purged

anyway, but anyhow, when in doubt
went on out and bought it 'cause i thought it would be jammin'
but examine all the flawsky wawsky, awfully
sad and it's costly, but that's all she
wrote and i hope i never have to float in that boat
up shit's creek, "it's weak" is the last quote
that i wanna hear when i'm goin' down

i really think you should retreat while we blow up the street
instead of copping please just freeze
maintain the focus while we smoke these marijuana trees
when i get down i disappear, reappear and blow up

one for the money, yes, sir, two for the show
a couple of years ago on headland and delowe
was the start of something good
where me and my nigga rode the marta through the hood
just tryna find that hook up
now everyday we looked up at the ceiling
watching ceiling fans go 'round, tryna catch that feeling
off instrumentals, had my pencil and plus my paper
we caught the 86 lithonia headed to decatur
writing rhymes, tryna find our spot off in that light
light off in that spot, knowing that we could rock
doing the hole in the wall clubs, this shit here must stop
like "freeze " we making the crowd move
but we not making no g's and that's a no no

check it, a one two, a one two dope niggas in the cadillac
they call us, went from player's ball to ballers
putting the south up on the map was like little rock to banging
niggas say mothafuck that playin, they payin, we stayin, layin vocals
locales done made it with them big boys up in this industry
"outkast, yeah, them niggas, they making big noise"
over a million sold to this day, niggas they take it lightly
'96 gon' be that year that all y'all playa haters can bite me
i'm out this bitch

me and you
your momma and your cousin too
rolling down the strip on vogues
coming up, slamming cadillac doors
me and you
your momma and your cousin too
rolling down the strip on vogues
coming up, slamming cadillac doors

back in the day, when i was younger, hunger
looking to fill me belly with that rally's bullshit
pull shit off, like it was supposed to be pulled
full as a tick, i was stoned like them white boys
smoking them white golds before them blunts got crunk
chunky asses, passes getting thrown like hail mary's
and they looking like halle berry's
so so fine, intertwined, but we ain't sipping wine
we's just chilling, i'm the rabid villain, and i'm so high
smoking freely, me, lil b, reek, mone and shug
and my little brother james, thangs changed in the hood
where i live at, them rats know, "momma i want to sing
but momma i want to trick, and momma i'm sucking dick now"
we moving on up in the world like elevators
me and the crew, we pimps like '82
me and you like tony toni tone
like this, east point and we gone

me and you
your momma and your cousin too
rolling down the strip on vogues
coming up, slamming cadillac doors
me and you
your momma and your cousin too
rolling down the strip on vogues
coming up, slamming cadillac doors

got stopped at the mall the other day
heard a call from the other way that i just came from
some nigga was saying something, talking 'bout smoke something "hey man, you remember me from school?" "no not really"
but he kept smiling like a clown, facial expression looking silly
and he kept asking me, "what kinda car you drive?
i know you paid, i know y'all got beaucoup of hoes
from all them songs that y'all done made"
and i replied that i had been going through the same things that he had
true, i've got more fans than the average man
but not enough loot to last me to the end of the week
i live by the beat like you live check to check
if it don't move your feet then i don't eat so we like neck to neck
yes, we done come a long way like them slim ass cigarettes
from virginia, this ain't gon' stop, so we just gon' continue

me and you
your momma and your cousin too
rolling down the strip on vogues
coming up, slamming cadillac doors
me and you
your momma and your cousin too
rolling down the strip on vogues
coming up, slamming cadillac doors
me and you
your momma and your cousin too
rolling down the strip on vogues
coming up, slamming cadillac doors
me and you
your momma and your cousin too
rolling down the strip on vogues
coming up, slamming cadillac doors
me and you

criminal thoughts in the blue porsche

i chill with niggas that hit dominican spots and steal bricks
my red beam made a dread scream and sprayed a fed team
corleone be turnin' niggas to fiends
yukons and ninja black lexus
'mega the pretty boy with mafia connections

the bigger nigga with the cheddar was mad dripper
he had a fuckin' villa in manilla
we got to flee to panama, but wait, it's half and half
ki's is one and two fifth, so how we flip?
32 grams raw, chop it in half, get 16
double it times three, we got 48
which mean a whole lot of cream
divide the profit by four
subtract it by eight, we back to 16
now add the other two that 'mega bringin' through
so let's see, if we flip this other ki
then that's more for me, mad coke and mad leak
plus a five hundred cut in half is two fifty
now triple that times three
we got three quarters of another ki

the firm, baby, vol. 1

turn the lights down, set them low
yeah you know where we could go
then you open up, will you open up
would you open up with your soul
or will you put it down in a hole
let it rot down to the core

do you know, know, know, know, know, know, so
pour out what you like
don t leave it tangled up inside
slow down what you're takin'

who am i to

who am i to lean on you and use you as a crutch
what have i been jaded for me

the harsh realities of life have taken toll
even jesus christ forsake my soul
please tell me what price to pay to make it whole
take control, i'm makin' dough but not enough to blow
jo's, they lust my flows, but ayo, i don't trust a soul
that's all i know or need to, these evil streets'll meet you
halfway and eat you alive tryin' to survive illegal
i'll leave you lost, mount you on a cross
whip you like a horse, sacrifice your life to a higher force
then i'll stomp your corpse
it's the bronx of course, recognize the accent
one of the last livin' still in action general assassins
catchin' any wreck, blastin' any tec, smashin' any chest
passin' any test; charles manson in the flesh
any last requests before you meet your maker?
sow what you reap or wake up
shakin' up a storm, like anita baker
i'll take you straight to hell and fill your heart with hate
incarcerate your fate in satan's fiery lake, then i lock the gate
make no mistake, this shit as real as joe
we follow the killer's code
when we come for you, tell me: where will you go?
nowhere to run, hide, i'll find you and silence your screams
and even if you kill me, i'll still be in your fuckin' dreams

you ain't a killer, you still learnin' how to walk
from new york to cali all the real niggas carry chalk
mark you for death
won't even talk that east or west crap
from watts to lefrak
it ain't where you're from, it's where's your gat

you've made a grave mistake
shouldn't have come here, you changed your fate
your brains'll make their debut on the table
when i raise the stakes
the pain is great, but only for a second
it starts strong, then lessens
just when you restin', the armaggedon sets in
left him with so much stress  t.s. 
blessed him with no regrets, yes
welcome to hell, son, the threshold of death
face the serpent, i blaze your person
you get laced for certain, leavin' jakes no trace to work from
close the case like curtains
i'm hurtin' heads severely, really tryin' to bring the pain
there's nothin' more satisfyin'
than when you cryin', screamin' my name
it's not a game, it's purple rain, floods of bloodstains
big pun's my thug's name
bustin' my guns, that's my love thang
i'll slit your jug' vein and snatch your adam's apple
john madden tackle your corpse
to hoist it on a cross at the tabernacle
that'll have to hurt, i'll work your body 'til it burst
then curse tu vida like a brujer a verse
i'm worse than anything you ever been through
sick in the head and mental
essentially meant to be the sole threat against you
when you awaken, your manhood'll be taken
fakin' like you satan, when i'm the rhymin' abomination

you ain't a killer, you still learnin' how to walk
from new york to cali all the real niggas carry chalk
mark you for death
won't even talk that east or west crap
from watts to lefrak
it ain't where you're from, it's where's your gat
you ain't a killer, you still learnin' how to walk
from new york to cali all the real niggas carry chalk
mark you for death
won't even talk that east or west crap
from watts to lefrak
it ain't where you're from, it's where's your gat

it's hard to analyze which guys are spies; be advised, people
we recognize who lies, it's all in the eyes, chico
we read 'em and see 'em for what they are
d's in undercover cars
takin' my picture like i'm a fuckin' star
i'm up to par, my game is in a smash
with half a million in the stash
passport with the gats, first name and last
ask anybody if my men are rowdy
give me the mini shottie
i'll body a nigga for a penny probably
i'm obligated to anything if it's crime related
if it shine, i'll take it; still in my prime and i finally made it
i hate the fact that i'm the last edition
properly a stats magician
could've went to college and been a mathematician
bad decisions kept me out the game
now i'm strictly out for cream
doin' things to fiends i doubt you'll ever dream
my team's the meanest thing you ever seen
measured by the heaven's kings
down to the devil's mezzanine
i've never screamed so loud, i'm proud to be alive
most heads die by 25 or catch a quick three to five
so be advised: the street's full of surprises
it's not what crew's the livest
one that survive, it's who's the wisest

you ain't a killer, you still learnin' how to walk
from new york to cali all the real niggas carry chalk
mark you for death
won't even talk that east or west crap
from watts to lefrak
it ain't where you're from, it's where's your gat
you ain't a killer, you still learnin' how to walk
from new york to cali all the real niggas carry chalk
mark you for death
won't even talk that east or west crap
from watts to lefrak
it ain't where you're from, it's where's your gat
you ain't a killer...

now that i escape, sleepwalker awake
those who could relate know the world ain't cake
jail bars ain't golden gates, those who fake, they break
when they meet their 400 pound mate
if i could rule the world, everyone would have a gun
in the ghetto of course, when giddyuping on their horse
i kick a rhyme drinking moonshine
i pour a sip on the concrete, for the deceased
but, no, don't weep, wyclef's in a state of sleep
thinking 'bout the robbery that i did last week
money in the bag, banker looked like a drag
i want to play with pellet guns from here to baghdad
gun blast, think fast, i think i'm hit
my girl pinched my hips to see if i still exist
i think not, i'll send a letter to my friends
a born again hooligan only to be king again

ready or not, here i come, you can't hide
gonna find you and take it slowly
ready or not, here i come, you can't hide
gonna find you and make you want me

i play my enemies like a game of chess

lest i must confess, my destiny's manifest
in some goretex and sweats
i make treks like i'm homeless
rap orgies with porgy and bess
capture your bounty, like elliot ness, yes

but i'll hex you with some witch's brew if you're doo doo
voodoo; i can do what you do, easy

to makin' my home from my spirit

and make sure it fit so now when i go and see with she
i thought the pirates through a telescope
and bomb 'em like it's make believe
blow me my sword, i out for my protection
'cause i might ship on landin' side and start an insurrection
a pirate had disguised himself as one of my crew
but i saw true and had to shake a him before he got through
hey, hey, guy the loot the booty
i formed like a ram, i gave an ultimatum
and told him he could do time
but he argued and fought me
he tried to bust right and so i took it upon myself

'cause these days, everyone with a deal with a record company
they go home, they write a rhyme
they think they ready to battle wyclef
some write forward, some write backward 
i wait for them to get jiggy then catch 'em in reverse, yo
with a verse that's worse than the last one
some say boof  even though you used to diss jamaicans
and hatians 'cause you thought i was american
ay pras, remember that song they sang?  yeah   
 go back to jamaica, what's good is what's new 
but now we boof baf the knuckles with the tranzlator crew laaaaa

this rap goes for the brothers in the neighborhood
who used to rap on a polaroid   here comes father joe
let me clock the block as i pull fo' five
boof baf  i cut the block but got stopped
i used to play hookie just to see how good an mc was
he said i bust a battle   aight, i still took a gun
no cheeba, cheeba just a libra on a natural high
i waited so long to come out, i died and came back to life
so, hear the spirits, many fear us, a new style, son
this the new thing under the sun, when i come, i come
bam bam, alakazam, he grabbed the pocket book, they ran
i came back with the bag 'cause that's my momma, man
i'm just patrollin', boof baf on the block
but the spot that i clock, you get shot if your numbers' are bad
so, don't get caught in the fast lane, the fast lane
and just remain yourself and be the same
'cause many rappers these days say nuttin' for nuttin'
so, here's somethin' to take you from the am to the pm

'cause an imitator could never be greater
than the creator whose the originator, step up perpetrator
see you later, alligator, back stabbin' traitor
tape recorder, duplicator
roughly ridin' with the head tranzlator, huh 
and leave the 40 to be naughty in the 'frigerator 


say, gun man  boof baf  
say, tell me where you get your damn gun from?  boof baf  
you musta get it from the foreign land  boof baf  
we want to shoot up the whole of babylon  boof baf  
pay the man to rhyme onto it
say, gun man  boof baf  
say, tell me where you get your damn gun from?  boof baf  
you musta get it from the foreign land  boof baf  
you want to kill your own brother, man  boof baf  
ay, ay, ay  boof baf   
  undecipherable singing  


one two   i'm bout to set this off 
like this, hip hoppers, check it

another mc lose his life tonight, lord
i beg that you pray to jesus christ, why
oh lord, father don't let him bury me, whoa

i haunt mcs like mephistopheles, bringing swords of damocles
secret service keep a close watch as if my name was kennedy
abstract raps simple with a street format
gaze into the sky and measure planets by parallax
check out the retrograde motion, kill the notion
of biting and recycling and calling it your own creation
i feel like rockwell, somebody's watching me
i got no privacy whether on land or at sea
and for you biting zealots, your raps are cacophonic
hypocrite, critic, but deep inside you wish you had the pop hit
it hurts don't it, a refugee come to your turf
and take over the earth

see my rhymes, are the type of fly rhymes
that can only get down with my crew
and if you try, to take lines or bite rhymes
we'll show you how the refugees do

yeah, yeah behold, as my odes, manifold on your rhymes
two mcs can't occupy the same space at the same time
it's against the laws of physics
so weep as your sweet dreams break up like eurythmics
rap rejects, my tape deck, ejects projectile
whether jew or gentile, i rank top percentile
many styles, more powerful than gamma rays
my grammar pays, like carlos santana plays "black magic woman"
so while you fuming, i'm consuming mango juice under polaris
you just embarrassed 'cause it's your last tango in paris
and even after all my logic and my theory
i add a "motherfucker" so you ignant niggas hear me
crew remember take notes, as i sow my rap oats
and for you biting zealots, here's a quote

another mc lose his life tonight, lord
i beg that you pray to jesus christ, why
oh lord, father don't let him bury me, whoa

you can try but you can't divide the tribe
these cats can't rap, mister author i feel no vibe
the magazine says the girl should have went solo
the guys should stop rapping   vanish like menudo
took it to the heart, but every actor plays his part
as long as someone was listening, i knew it was a start
for me to get my chance, grab my pen and revamp
do a cameo while everybody do the dance
quick now, cause you running out of luck a
playing mr. big, i'm gonna get you sucka
while you munching at your luncheon
i'll be planning your assassination, then hit you like the dutchman

i compress sound sets with my rap dbx
then drop vocals on my 456 ampex
bring terror to the shop of horror
as she cry, "mi amor," the phantom dies in the opera
and to the younguns who carry gadgets
and kill six days a week, then rest on the sabbath
violence ain't necessary, unless you provoke me
then get buried like the great mussolini
and for you biting zealots, your rap styles are relics
no matter who you damage, you're still a false prophet


a little bit of loving
a little bit of something from you

oh
if it's time to make your spouse feel good
i make sure that you got all your plans done right
'cause i'm not sure
if she was right
that i don't really know what they can tell me
about our love so special
what do they know about our flavor?
tell me if it's real so i don't slap myself
'cause there's no point in hidin'
i feel ignited with your love
it's so obvious, i'm sorry that it's pure
yeah yeah

i think i need a little bit of lovin'
a little bit of somethin'
i think i need a little bit of lovin'
a little bit of somethin' from you
woah, i think i need a little bit of lovin'
a little bit of somethin', yeah
'cause this love is all i have of you

if you like me now, wait 'til you get used to me
this is not no sit down go   get off your feet
we could dance all night, girl come and rock with me
this ain't the same old love that you can get every week  no, no 
take a trip around the world with me  come on girl 
i will take a chance to get down with you  get down, get down 
my past is my past, leave that back  leave that behind 
i'll give myself to you, woah woah

i think i need a little bit of lovin'
a little bit of somethin'
i think i need a little bit of lovin'
a little bit of somethin' from you
woah, i think i need a little bit of lovin'
a little bit of somethin', yeah
'cause this love is all i have of you

it's all in her eyes
what we share, you and i  yeah 
it is no more, not the same
but it's all that we made

i think i need a little bit of lovin'
a little bit of somethin'
i think i need a little bit of lovin'
a little bit of somethin' from you
woah, i think i need a little bit of lovin'
a little bit of somethin', yeah  just a little bit, just a little bit 
'cause this love is all i have of you  yeah, yeah 


ah  check the crippled man, sittin' in the church
my conscience hurts, flesh like me hits the dirt
she's paralyzed from her feet to her thighs
and the man who pulled the trigger didn't even lose his left eye.
i check jimmy cuttin hair at the barbershop
he plays the bass guitar, like david plays the harp
his knowledge name is greek, cause whenever he speaks
he's got the wisdom of king solomon, bags in his eyes from no sleep
sometimes he thought of the fame in madison square garden
so some seek stardom, but they forget harlem
but "seek ye, first of all the kingdom of god," is what my pops told me
so if i fall, could the choir catch me?
i flew away, on a mountain, got tempted by satan
got bitten by a cobra, but the lord took my venom
so who's side am i on? i'm on the righteous
always check the lyrics, no time to contradict

some seek stardom, then they forget harlem
some seek stardom, then they forget harlem
some seek stardom, then they forget harlem
they keep their pockets full, but their souls run empty

well ay yo family i beseech you, in the hopes that i may reach you
my mother taught me one day that judgment day would come someday
born a dark black child, with kinky hair grown wise
and teachers disliked me, cause i knew where my culture be
so now yeah mom i read history, i can't neglect my passion, see
rockin's kind of new to me, cause my true love was poetry
white was good and bad was black but black was just a massa lackey
built for that b. nimble jack and i'd like to save you from the wicked
d dog clear i wouldn't be wet; the black to mourn, tomorrow's death
the evil things, glad that i, while angels wrote this violence why?
help me make me comprehend my black bezerk and why cast it
time to blaze the angels nappy heads are braided that you make me
see what's wrong with me that don't make you flee when i enter your
vicinity, you see my god ain't never asked of me
so yo i be wised up with greek to go and be
but at last i clearly see what's wrong with me: it be your
insecurity of me and my ability
so, prithee, won't you let me be or has thou asked too much from thy
to tell the truth and not to lie? oh my...

some seek stardom, then they forget harlem
some seek stardom, then they forget harlem
some seek stardom, then they forget harlem
brothers keep their pockets full, but their souls run empty
some seek stardom, then they forget harlem
some seek stardom, then they forget harlem
some seek stardom, then they forget harlem
sisters keep their pockets full, but their souls run empty

but as i grew, i knew cause the master told me
from a baby to a woman from a woman to a baby
life is so short, hardcore becomes hard corpse
stiff in a coffin where the money's no longer the source
there we go, there we go, there we go
i got mine now won't you get yours, we never open doors
so we neglect, and don't protect the ones that's left
people never really seem to care
and then they cry out, "my people  why aren't we treated equal?"
as we flee, we flee our own communities
we leave our family in poverty
and then we blame it on another, so family please recover
oh c'mon please you can come with me now and blow it now
if you want to, we're through...

some seek stardom, then they forget harlem
some seek stardom, then they forget harlem
some seek stardom, then they forget harlem
families keep their pockets full, but their souls run empty
some seek stardom, then they forget harlem
some seek stardom, then they forget harlem
some seek stardom, then they forget harlem
people keep their pockets full, but their souls run empty
some seek stardom, then they forget harlem
some seek stardom, then they forget harlem
some seek stardom, then they forget harlem
we keep their pockets full, but their souls run empty
some seek stardom, then they forget harlem
some seek stardom, then they forget harlem
some seek stardom, then they forget harlem
brothers keep their pockets full, but their souls run empty

yendo m s despacio
nunca aprend  a frenar
ni a volar m s alto
no pas  de tu portal
vest as de luto
cuando bailas frenes 
esto no ha acabado
no ha llegado a su fin
perd  la fama en un cabaret
se han olvidado a qu  huele la luna
y en las cantinas, c mo bailan, c mo cantan
se han olvidado a qu  huela la luna
el d a es claro, ha salido solo
te han entrado ganas de bebertelo todo
crees que cuando bailas no se esconde el miedo
y sobre su cuello flotan los pa uelos
solo hace falta que demos la vuelta
recapitulemos, paguemos a medias
mi sobredosis siempre ser n tus piernas
que beben del metal que hay en tus venas
y en las cantinas, c mo bailan, c mo cantan
se han olvidado a que huele la luna
y en las cantinas, c mo r en, c mo bailan
se han olvidado a que huele la luna
el d a es raro
ni te echo de menos
podr a tocarle a cualquiera diez boleros
todo se acaba, dijiste mirando
no pasa nada, nos vamos de aqui

no such thing as a life that's better than yours  love yours 
no such thing as a life that's better than yours
no such thing, no such thing

heart beatin' fast, let a nigga know that he alive
fake niggas, mad snakes
snakes in the grass let a nigga know that he arrived
don't be sleepin' on your level
'cause it's beauty in the struggle, nigga  beauty, beauty 
goes for all y'all
it's beauty in the struggle, nigga  beauty, beauty 
let me explain, yeah

it's beauty in the struggle, ugliness in the success
hear my words or listen to my signal of distress
i grew up in the city and though sometimes we had less
compared to some of my niggas
down the block, man, we were blessed
and life can't be no fairytale, no once upon a time
but i be goddamned if a nigga don't be tryin'
so tell me, momma please, why you be drinkin' all the time?
does all the pain he brought you still linger in your mind?
'cause pain still lingers on mine
on the road to riches, listen, this is what you'll find
the good news is, nigga, you came a long way
the bad news is, nigga, you went the wrong way
think being broke was better

no such thing as a life that's better than yours
no such thing as a life that's better than yours
 think being broke was better 
no such thing as a life that's better than yours
no such thing, no such thing

for what's money without happiness?
or hard times without the people you love?
though i'm not sure what's 'bout to happen next
i asked for strength from the lord up above
'cause i've been strong so far
but i can feel my grip loosenin'
quick, do somethin' before you lose it for good
get it back and use it for good
and touch the people how you did like before
i'm tired of livin' with demons 'cause they always invitin' more
think being broke was better
now i don't mean that phrase with no disrespect
to all my niggas out there livin' in debt
cashin' minimal checks, turn on the tv see a nigga rolex
and fantasize about a life with no stress
i mean this shit sincerely
and as a nigga who was once in your shoes
livin' with nothin' to lose, i hope one day you hear me
always gon' be a bigger house somewhere, but nigga feel me
long as the people in that motherfucker love you dearly
always gon' be a whip that's better than the one you got
always gon' be some clothes that's fresher than the ones you rock
always gon' be a bitch that's badder out there on the tours
but you ain't never gon' be happy 'til you love yours

no such thing as a life that's better than yours  love yours 
no such thing as a life that's better than yours  love yours 
no such thing as a life that's better than yours  love yours 
no such thing, no such thing

heart beatin' fast, let a nigga know that he alive
fake niggas, mad snakes
snakes in the grass let a nigga know that he arrived

can't be without you, baby
not even for a night
and so i've been thinking lately
of being with you for all time

mmm, it's four thirty in eastern time where i'm at, shorty
in the a.m., i'm sayin' though, where you at, shorty?
i'm happy without you but got my doubts, shorty
like, like if my currency dry out, would you be out thirsty?
would your mind want me, like your soul want me?
when i go down on you, i drown for quarter centuries
you a whole globe, you a whole earth
and i'm a troubled millionaire that fears you know your worth
absence makes the heart grow fonder so we ponder
on the things we gon' do when distance ain't a problem
our intentions, they was honest, we was cordial, we was talkin'
we was hidin', there was no one, we was lyin', it was fuckin'
foreplay with your body divided now
it's forehead kisses before my flight departed, that
showed me the feelings, about to play with that
three days away, three hours back, hold on

can't be without you, baby
ain't got no voice
where my phone? who got my phone? you got my phone?
she called me, hold on man
 you have reach the voicemail box 
hol' up

just got off the stage, know you sleepin', but wait
just lost my voice for this crowd i only seen your face in everywhere, but these women real as a fairy tale
can barely talk but you hit my line, i'ma hear you well
i need that vibe from you 'cause spendin' time on this bus
take the power from my brain, in between your thighs they should rest
we alive, we in love, we can die if we don't
if monogamy you want then share your time with pornhub  ha  
i'm just playin', just need you know i'm lonely
green tea, ricola and honey gold
we missin' each other more so we horny or don't speak
three hours apart, cool, two days and you seein' me
my vocals is now shot, call up doctor, steroid me
we cortisone 'til my quarter zone is back as your toy please
i know you don't need nothin' but what i got
two days away, three hours back, goodnight

 can't be without you, baby 
we one tomorrow away from celebratin' that that very tomorrow's the day  not even for a night 
i know it's late but i'ma hit you later
 and so i been thinking lately of being with you for all time 

i'm on the way, you know
once you know my voice back
'cause see like a hunnid forevers plus a day since i last seen the livin' embodiment of my forever
face to face and i might just inject your body with knowledge
your body with style, you'll be flyer than rox brown
okay, i'm lyin', nobody flyin' than rox
but i might just get in a half squat position and proposition you with a shiny rock under an open box
so the onlookers can understand that we all official
we all just kids lookin' for the first love we ever injected
so whenever i'm never next to you, i never look to the next woman even on her best moment to bestowed
a stove you kept warm for me, as i kept distance you kept cookin'
sugar, we went from three days and three hours 'til we two days and three hours to, "girl he think he darius lovehall, he walkin' down the street writin' poetry to make the between yo' knees feel like you need balance"
and i see you alot but i see you on camera so it seem like a lie when i say i need to see us together
from three days to two days, from two days to today
from today to tonight, from tonight to forever, i'm up the street

so then we moved to shaolin land
a young youth, yo, rockin' the gold tooth, 'lo goose
only way i be gettin' the g off was drug loot
and let's start it like this, son
rollin' with this one and that one
pullin' out gats for fun
but it was just a dream for the teen who was a fiend
started smokin' woolies at 16
and runnin' up in gates and doin' hits for high stakes
makin' my way on fire escapes
no question i would speed for cracks and weed
the combination made my eyes bleed
no question i would flow off and try to get the dough all
stickin' up white boys in ball courts
my life got no better, same damn 'lo sweater
times is rough and tough like leather
figured out i went the wrong route
so i got with a sick ass clique and went all out

it's been twenty two long hard years, i'm still strugglin'
survival got me buggin', but i'm alive on arrival
i peep at the shape of the streets
and stay awake to the ways of the world 'cause shit is deep
a man with a dream with plans to make cream
which failed; i went to jail at the age of fifteen
a young buck sellin' drugs and such, who never had much
tryin' to get a clutch at what i could not
the court played me short, now i face incarceration
pacin', goin' upstate's my destination
handcuffed in the back of a bus, forty of us
life as a shorty shouldn't be so rough
but as the world turned i learned life is hell
livin' in the world no different from a cell
every day i escape from jakes givin' chase
sellin' base, smokin' bones in the staircase
though i don't know why i chose to smoke sess
i guess that's the time when i'm not depressed
but i'm still depressed, and i ask: what's it worth?
ready to give up so i seek the old earth
who explained workin' hard may help you maintain
to learn to overcome the heartaches and pain
we got stick up kids, corrupt cops, and crack rocks
and stray shots, all on the block that stays hot
leave it up to me while i be livin' proof
to kick the truth to the young black youth
but shorty's runnin' wild, smokin' sess, drinkin' beer
and ain't tryin' to hear what i'm kickin' in his ear
neglected for now, but yo, it gots to be accepted
that what? that life is hectic

thinking maybe you'll come back here to the place that we'd meet
and you'll see me waiting for you, on the corner of the street

who's waiting on a girl, oh
there are no holes in his shoes
but a big hole in his world, yeah
maybe i'll get famous
as the man who can't be moved
and maybe you won't mean to
but you'll see me on the news
and you'll come running to the corner
'cause you know it's just for you
i'm the man who can't be moved
i'm the man who can't be moved

'cause if one day you wake up, and find that you're missing me  find you're missing me

er ist auf dem weg nach hause mit der bahn
schaut aus dem fenster, l sst gedanken freien lauf
lehnt sich ganz entspannt zur ck, denn er muss lange noch nicht raus
paar menschen steigen ein, andre wieder aus

ich bin ein versager, weil ich mich doch nicht trau'
mein kopf ist voller w rter, doch es kommt nichts raus
und sie steht auf, steigt aus und sagt:
„bye bye, bye bye meine liebe des lebens
und ja, wir beide werd'n uns nie wieder seh'n
kann schon sein, dass man sich im leben zweimal begegnet
doch es beim zweiten mal dann einfach zu sp t ist

'cause you'll know it's just for you
you'll know it's just for you
'cause if one day you wake up and find that you're missing me
and your heart starts to wonder where on this earth i could be
thinking maybe you'll come back here to the place that we'd meet
and you'll see me waiting for you on our corner of the street
so i'm not moving, i'm not moving
no
i'm not moving, i'm not moving

gonna camp in my sleeping bag i'm not gonna move

you think oakland california is a city of punks
it only takes a second, to pop the trunk
and just like that you know it's real
you're in the right damn town to get killed
it's all about the game, and nothin else
you come out here, you better watch yourself
cause you can wear what you want, even blue or red
but cross the wrong brothers, and end up dead
you catch a body full of bullets, and get blasted
tryin to be a gangsta but you just ain't lastin
this little town is gettin wild as hell
check the penetentiaries and all the jails
if they could lock us all up that would be just fine
got my partners from oakland doin serious time
you can't argue with the truth it's hard to be black
but it's a mindgame, and you gotta deal with that
i wake up everyday and i just can't wait
to make mo money, cause back in the days
when i rapped, i did the same damn thing i do now
grab the microphone, and show you how
but i was broke, the only thing i had was game
i started makin money and knew things would change
bought a benz, thought it might earn respect
but the opd, found it hard to accept
i got jacked by the task and jacked by the vice
face down on the ground keep my hands in sight
put the handcuffs on backseat i'm in it
illegal search for about thirty minutes
askin me, where's the dope
where's my gun, but i don't know
i said i'm rappin, they laugh like i told a joke
and to this day they think i'm sellin coke

i want to be free   and that's the truth  ohhh yeahhh
i want to be free  ohhh yeahhh

i be in oakland california every day of my life
bass so hard you think i'm smokin a pipe
and if i don't smoke it, i gots to grind
searched all my stuff, and all you find
is a pocket full of money count seven g's
now you wanna think i'm sellin keys
cause i'm a black man, but i run my own business
so why the police wanna send me to prison
they see a brother makin major cash
they knock a patch out his black ass
and that's the truth, you can't argue you at all
tryin to give you ten years for a phone call
ain't even trippin on the dank smoke
cause all they wanna find, is guns and coke
in court all the time tryin to fight it
we get rich, we get indeibted
so what's the problem officer this time?
is havin' big money being black a crime?
or did you take me to jail, to teach me a lesson
charge me with somethin, or just ask questions
about the brothers i hang around
what's really goin on in the oakland town
tell me who went broke, and who got rich
but too $hort baby just ain't no snitch
you say you're just doin your job
but you're gettin on my nerves, just like bob
everytime i hit a corner, i see you
always tellin brothers what to do
you lock me up cause i don't know how to act
but i'm down for mine so i be talkin back
and when i do, you treat me bad as hell
i'm sick of spendin nights in jail


got out of jail about fo' fifteen
walkin down the street like a broke dopefiend
had a pocket full of money tryin to play the role
benz got towed and i was hella cold
but i ain't trippin, i'm gettin used to it now
handcuffed your boy took me straight downtown
for three warrants, had to catch me sooner or later
cause the five oh's always tryin to jack a playa
for no reason, wasn't doin nothin wrong
you think i'm lyin, singin that same ol song
well i'm a black man, ridin in a benz
how in the hell did i make these ends? here we go
i pull over to the right
stop the engine keep my hands in sight
i start cursin, cause it don't make sense
why would i run and try to jump a fence
if i was plannin, a smooth getaway
i never woulda stopped in the first place
you'd be high speed chasin me but this time you ain't
cause all i got on me is a big fat bank
and i hope i don't get robbed by you know who
make me donate some g's to the boys in blue
and if i sue, i won't get nothin back
but i ain't mad... i'm just black...

all you other motherfuckers get out my business  really 
only god can judge me now

perhaps i was blind to the facts, stabbed in the back
i couldn't trust my own homies, just a bunch of dirty rats
will i succeed? paranoid from the weed
and hocus pocus, i try to focus, but i can't see
and in my mind i'm a blind man doin' time
look to my future,  cause my past is all behind me
is it a crime to fight for what is mine?
everybody's dyin', tell me what's the use of tryin'
i've been trapped since birth, cautious  cause i'm cursed
and fantasies of my family in a hearse
and they say it's the white man i should fear
but it's my own kind doin' all the killin' here
i can't lie, ain't no love for the other side
jealousy inside, make 'em wish i died
oh my lord, tell me what i'm livin' for
everybody's droppin', got me knockin' on heaven's door
and all my memories of seein' brothers bleed
and everybody grieves, but still nobody sees
recollect your thoughts, don't get caught up in the mix
 cause the media is full of dirty tricks

only god can judge me
only god can judge me, only god
only god can judge me
only god can judge me
only god can judge me, only god
only god can judge me now
only god can judge me, only god
only god can judge me
only god can judge me, only god
only god can judge me


i hear the doctor standin' over me, screamin' i can make it
got a body full of bullet holes, layin' here naked
still i can't breathe, something's evil in my iv
 cause everytime i breathe i think they killin' me
i'm havin' nightmares, homicidal fantasies
i wake up stranglin', tangled in my bed sheets
i call the nurse  cause it hurts to reminisce
how did it come to this? i wish they didn't miss
somebody help me, tell me where to go from here
 cause even thugs cry, but do the lord care?
try to remember but it hurts
i'm walkin' through the cemetery, talkin' to the dirt
i'd rather die like a man than live like a coward
there's a ghetto up in heaven and it's ours
"black power " is what we scream
as we dream in a paranoid state
and our fate is a lifetime of hate
dear mama, can you save me? and fuck peace
 cause the streets got our babies, we gotta eat
no more hesitation, each and every black male's trapped
and they wonder why we suicidal running 'round strapped

sold a half a million tapes, now everybody want him
after talkin' behind my back like a bitch would
tellin' them niggas, "you can fade him"

that's why they ride the bandwagon
still be draggin', sellin' lies
don't think i don't see you haters, i know y'all in disguise

some nights, i call it a draw
some nights, i wish that my lips could build a castle
some nights, i wish they'd just fall off
but i still wake up, i still see your ghost
oh, lord, i'm still not sure what i stand for, oh
what do i stand for?
what do i stand for?
most nights, i don't know anymore

this is it, boys, this is war
what are we waiting for?
why don't we break the rules already?
i was never one to believe the hype
save that for the black and white
try twice as hard and i'm half as liked
but here they come again to jack my style
and that's alright, i found a martyr in my bed tonight
she stops my bones from wondering
just who i, who, i, who i am
oh, who am i?

well, some nights, i wish that this all would end
'cause i could use some friends for a change
and some nights, i'm scared you'll forget me again
some nights, i always win  i always win 
but i still wake up, i still see your ghost
oh lord, i'm still not sure what i stand for, oh
what do i stand for?
what do i stand for?
most nights, i don't know

 oh, come on  so this is it?
i sold my soul for this?
washed my hands of that for this?

when i hear songs, they sound like a swan
so, come on

sorry to leave, mom, i had to go
who the fuck wants to die alone
all dried up in the desert sun?

my heart is breaking for my sister
and the con that she called "love"
and then i look into my nephew's eyes
man, you wouldn't believe the most amazing things
that can come from some terrible nights

the other night, you wouldn't believe
the dream i just had about you and me
i called you up, but we'd both agree
it's for the best you didn't listen
it's for the best we get our distance, oh

smokin' weed in bambú, sippin' on private stock
way back, when i had the red and black lumberjack
with the hat to match
remember rappin' duke? duh ha, duh ha

condos in queens, indo for weeks
sold out seats to hear biggie smalls speak
living life without fear
puttin' five karats in my baby girl ear

considered a fool 'cause i dropped out of high school
stereotypes of a black male misunderstood
and it's still all good
and if you don't know, now you know, nigga

you showed me love
glory from above
regard, my dear
it's all downhill from here

in the wake of a hurricane
dark skin of a summer shade
nosedive into flood lines
tall tower of milk crates
it's the same way you showed me
cannonball off the porch side
older kids trying off the roof
just the same way you showed me  you showed 
if you could die and come back to life
up for air from the swimming pool
you'd kneel down to the dry land
kiss the earth that birthed you
gave you tools just to stay alive
and make it out when the sun is ruined

that's the same way you showed me, showed me
you showed me love
glory from above
regard, my dear
it's all downhill from here

remember life, remember how it was
climb trees, michael jackson, it all ends here
say what up to matthew, to shoob
say what up to danny
say what up to life immortality
bending up my nikes
running out the melpomene, nicotine
stealing granny cigs  take it easy 
gimme something sweet

what have i been so afraid of?
i don't know

from brooklyn to new york, then off to the west
in cali, no khaled, but we the best
my stripes, stay american, let me express
and i keep it as live as a total request
and they ask me these questions
like, "how do you do it?
press and the road and the music"
truth is, i'm always up, i'm always down
worry 'bout everyone else

but once in a while, i catch myself
once in a while, i ask myself
what am i doing?
once in a while, i need your help
but once in a while i feel like
i just wanna dance
i feel good, yeah, i feel good
i feel good  good, good, good, yeah  i feel good

i feel good,  good, good, good, yeah  i feel good

i've been looking at where we're going
there's no slowing down to go back
and thinking of where we've been
no one's ever been given a road map
say, "slow down, turn here, graduate and work here
come and get a raise when you finish up your first year"
no, if you're doing it, you're doing it right
keep it moving, now, tell me what you're doing tonight
cause sometimes we're up, sometimes we're down
don't worry about anyone else

but once in a while, i catch myself

but once in a while i feel like
i just wanna dance
i feel good, yeah, i feel good

i'll attack any nigga who slack in his mack
come fully packed with a fat rugged stack
shame on you when you step through to
the ol' dirty bastard straight from the brooklyn zu
and i'll be damned if i let any man
come to my center, you enter the winter
straight up and down, that shit is packed jam
you can't slam, don't let me get fool on him, man
the ol' dirty bastard is dirty and stinkin'
ason unique rollin' with the night of the creeps
niggas be rollin' with a stash, ain't sayin' cash
bite my style, i'll bite your motherfuckin' ass

for cryin' out loud, my style is wild, so book me
not long is how long that this rhyme took me
ejectin' styles from my lethal weapon
my pen that rocks from here to oregon
there's more again, catch it like a psycho flashback
i love gats; if rap was a gun, you wouldn't bust back
i come with shit in all types of shapes and sounds
and where i lounge is my stompin' grounds
i give an order to my peeps across the water
to go and snatch up props all around the border
and get far like a shootin' star
'cause who i are is livin' the life of pablo escobar
point blank as i kick the square biz
there it is, you're fuckin' with pros, and there it goes

yo, chill with the feedback, black, we don't need that
it's 10 o'clock, ho, where the fuck's your seed at?
feelin' mad hostile, wearin' a ropostale
flowin' like christ when i speaks the gospel
stroll with the holy robe, then attack the globe
with the buck us style, the ruckus
ten times ten men committin' mad sin
turn the other cheek and i'll break your fuckin' chin
slayin' boom bangs like african drums
 he'll be  comin' around the mountain when i come
crazy flamboyant for the rap enjoyment
my clan increase like black unemployment
yeah, another one dare
jih jigga genius; take us the fuck outta here

the wu is too slammin' for these cold killin' labels
some ain't had hits since i seen aunt mabel
be doin' artists in like cain did abel
now they money's gettin' stuck to the gum under the table
that's what you get when you misuse what i invent
your empire falls and you lose every cent
for tryna blow up a scrub
now that thought was just as bright as a 20 watt light bulb
should've pumped it when i rocked it
niggas so stingy they got short arms and deep pockets
this goes on in some companies
with majors, they're scared to death to pump these
first of all, who's your a r?
a mountain climber who plays an electric guitar?
but he don't know the meanin' of dope
when he's lookin' for a suit and tie rap
that's cleaner than a bar of soap
and i'm the dirtiest thing in sight

this is gonna sound like a bad joke
but momma, i fell in love again
it's safe to say i have a new girlfriend
and i know it sounds so old
but cupid got me in a chokehold
and i'm afraid i might give in
towel's on the mat, my white flag is wavin'
i mean, she even cooks me pancakes
and alka seltzer when my tummy aches
if that ain't love then i don't know what love is
we even got a secret handshake
and she loves the music that my band makes
i know i'm young, but if i had to choose her or the sun

i never felt like you should be deprived of anything
if a man didn't want to take care of his child, you move on
and that's what i did, i moved on

a boy to raise at a young age

no help from him, but she's alive

he always wanted to be a father but he never took care of you
he ain't have no money, he ain't have nothin'
how can you care about somebody
and you never give the welfare of them?

ey yo, ich hab' so das gef hl dieser tag heut wird dope
reiß alle fenster raus und dann dreh die mucke auf
leg die fernbedienung weg, leb den film so wie ich
denn mein nachbar h rt jetzt rap ob er will oder nicht
ey, ich f hl' mich so fly,  so fly , so fly
denn ich f hl' mich so fly
wenn ich rhyme bin ich weit, weit weg
von dem streit, jedem stress, ganz allein, bleib relaxt
bin mein eigener chef, dieses life ist perfekt

und immer wenn die angst mich verfolgt
und die zweifel mich fast wieder kill'n
weil ich nicht weiß was passiert
ich will schreien, aber bleib lieber still
und wenn die zeit nicht vergeht, weil es einfach nicht l uft wie man will
doch dann kommt diese melodie, dieses lied
ich war nie so verliebt, war noch nie so verliebt, war noch nie so verliebt

und alles beginnt sich zu dreh'n
und alles beginnt sich zu dreh'n
und alles beginnt sich zu dreh'n
und alles beginnt sich zu dreh'n
und alles beginnt sich zu dreh'n

ist schon klar, manchmal ist es hart
doch ich sitz nicht zuhaus' und denk' den ganzen tag nur nach
wenn leute sagen, rapp' mal wieder so wie vor 'nem jahr
damals warst du noch mein star   ist mir sowas von egal
black on black   versace dress, der deutsche kanye west
nur nicht ganz so arrogant, bin eher so sympathisch nett
große bilder   art attack, der typ der auf sich warten l sst
doch komm ich auf die party, dann halt besser deine barbie fest

und immer wenn die angst mich verfolgt
und die zweifel mich fast wieder kill'n
weil ich nicht weiß was passiert
ich will schreien, aber bleib lieber still
und wenn die zeit nicht vergeht, weil es einfach nicht l uft wie man will
doch dann kommt diese melodie, dieses lied
ich war nie so verliebt, war noch nie so verliebt, war noch nie so verliebt

und alles beginnt sich zu dreh'n
und alles beginnt sich zu dreh'n
und alles beginnt sich zu dreh'n
und alles beginnt sich zu dreh'n
und alles beginnt sich zu dreh'n
und alles beginnt sich zu dreh'n
und alles beginnt sich zu dreh'n
und alles beginnt sich zu dreh'n
und alles beginnt sich zu dreh'n
und alles beginnt sich zu dreh'n
und alles beginnt sich zu dreh'n

that guy  guy 
i'm smooth
no lie  lie 
girl boo, you dry
they say i look good, wanna hear it again
if nobody saw me in it, i'ma wear it again
'cause i don't give a fuck
i look good, i look good, i look good

i look like bae
i look like bae
i look like bae
i look like bae
aye, aye


check me out, look

i know perfect timing feels like i'm too late
and i know i'm still great in spite of my mistakes
you know it's authentic, every rhyme i say
my only regret is i made niggas wait
see, ain't too many like us, we like vintage bape
and i don't fuck with busters, i can't integrate
grew up with these killers in my living space
lotta niggas folded through them village days
citywide, gang and junction police raids
l.a. times, rollin 60s, made the front page
i vowed to never let you ditch and seal my fate
sellin' dope with hopes to graduate to real estate
i knew i was drummin' to a different beat
felt it in my stomach, i was just unique
we decided we gon' let these digits speak
then we turn slauson into venice beach
s 600 maybach, platinum dealer plates
wake up in this penthouse to the cityscape
you know it's authentic, every shit i say
i knew self destruction ain't the only way
sometimes perfect timing feels like i'm too late
but  i know you still great in spite of your mistakes
before you run your race you gotta find a pace
just make sure you cross the line, and fuck the time it takes
i got out the county jail 2008
couple months, i dropped the tape then i was on my way
my first single out, it set the streets ablaze
on location, shot that video in front the cage
tryna find my way through this fuckin' maze
every concert, hundred niggas on the stage
i'm still active so it's really just another day
promoters paranoid to book you, that affects ya pay
and when you stop eatin', that affects your weight
and when you get hungry, that affects your brain
see me i'm not trippin', i respect the game
i hope y'all do, if i can't make it, i'm gon' take your chain
see ain't too many like us, we like vintage bape
and i don't fuck with busters i can't integrate
i know perfect timing feels like i'm too late
but every single time i drop they tell me i'm the great

victory lap


oh baby it's been soo long, oohh
oh baby it's been soo long, oohh

mogul and they know that, logo on my floor mat
courtside chamberlain throwback match my rolex
everywhere i go, flex, vallet park on some loc shit
whole lot of smoke in that 'rari, that thing potent
burnin' rubber, wearin' cameras, they was undercovers
under pressure, made statements, turned on they brothers
never judge you, but the streets will never love you
i wonder what it come to you in your brain for you to run to
ones that hate us, hand cuff us and mace us
call us dumb niggas 'cause our culture is contagious
third generation, south central gang bangers
that lived long enough to see it changing
think it's time we make arrangements
finally wiggle out they mazes, find me out in different places
 i m the spook by the door , this the infiltration, double back, dressed in blue laces

oh baby it's been soo long, oohh
oh baby it's been soo long, oohh

they killed dr. sebi, he was teachin' health
i fuck with rick ross 'cause he teachin' wealth
dropped out of school, i'ma teach myself
made my first mil' on my own, i don't need your help
all black tom ford, it's a special evenin'
city council meetin', they got hussle speakin'
billion dollar project bout to crack the cement
so one of our investments had become strategic
summer roll '18, man it's such a season
'bout to make more partners look like fuckin' geniuses
we was in the regal, it was me and steven
we done took a dream and turned it to a zenith
anything i want and everything i needed
gotta pace yourself, it's all about yo' breathin'
you can have it all, it's all about your reason
i done took my name and carved it in the cement

oh baby it's been soo long, oohh
oh baby it's been soo long, oohh

i flashback on that shootout at the beach, twenty deep
you tried to squeeze, your gun jammed and they released
blood on your tee, how many stains? i see three
the bitch started to panic so i made her switch seats
drivin' now, police chopper ahead flyin' now
really not too spooked, calmly asked me, "am i dyin' now?"
all i know is keep you calm and collected
crackin' jokes like, "nigga, now you gon' be finally respected"
see your blood leakin', got my foot on this gas
tossed the .40, we pull up to daniel free and see crash
you know the alibi, they started shootin', we was standin' by
ain't see nothing, but the flare from the talons fly
"i wasn't there, i was passin' by"
matter fact, don't say shit, i'm just gon' drop you in the back and slide
that's yo weed, all the cash is mine
i take 'em both to the spot plus your phone til you back online

oh baby it's been soo long, oohh
oh baby it's been soo long, oohh

i prayed that he would finish
but he just kept right on

strumming my pain with his fingers  one time, one time 
singing my life with his words  two times, two times

strumming my pain.....

i see your face, it's haunting me
i guess i need you, baby

i get mad frustrated when i rhyme
thinkin' of all them kids that try to do this for all the wrong reasons
seasons change, mad things rearrange
but it all stays the same like the love doctor strange
i'm tame like the rapper
get red like a snapper, when they do that
got your whole block saying true dat
if only they knew that it was you who was irregular
sold your soul for some secular muzak that's wack
plus you use that, loop over and over
claiming that you got a new style
your attempts are futile, ooh child
you puerile, brain waves are sterile
you can't create, you just wait to take, my tapes  bing  
laced with malice, hands get calloused
from gripping microphones from here to dallas
go ask alice if you don't believe me
i get innervisions like stevie
see me, ascend from the chalice like the weed be
indeed we like khalid muhammad
mcs make me vomit; i get controversial
freak your style with no rehearsal
au contraire mon frere, don't you even go there
me without a mic is like a beat without a snare
i dare to tear into your ego, we go
way back like some ganja and pelequo
or coleco vision, my rhymes make incisions in your anatomy

so on my day off, with david sonnenberg i play golf
run through crown heights screaming out, mazel tov 
problem with no man; before black, i'm first human
appetite to write like frederick douglass with a slave hand
street pressure, word to poppa, i ain't goin' under
one day i'll have a label and make deals with tommy mottola
momma always told me, "you're one in a million"
always watch your back, never tangle with haitian sicilians
now i got a record deal, "how does it feel?"
i'm never gonna survive unless i get crazy like seal
'cause the whole world's out of order
so at night the fiends dance on grease with john travolta
one got slaughtered as he coughed blood from his mouth
the other tried to duck and caught a left with my guinness stout
brother, brother, can't you get this through your head?
this is set up by the feds, they're scoping us with their infra reds

how many mics do we rip on the daily
say, me say many money say me say many many many
how many mics do we rip on the daily
many money say me say many many many

too many mc's, not enough mics
exit your show like i exit the turnpike
dicin' dynamite like dolomite
double do's been like i don't dick van dyke
star light to star bright the freaks come out at night
like my man wyclef  i wear my sunglasses at night 
and my panache will mosh your entourage
squash the squad and hide their bodies under my garage
and when the cops come lookin, i be bookin to brooklyn
leave the trails broken flippin' tokens to hoboken
a clean getaway like alec baldwin
driving in my fast car playing tracy chapman

how many mics do we rip on the daily
say, me say many money say me say many many many
how many mics do we rip on the daily
many money say me say many many many

to all the teachers that told me i'd never amount to nothin'
to all the people that lived above the buildings that i was hustlin' in front of
called the police on me when i was just tryin' to make some money to feed my daughter  it's all good 
and all the niggas in the struggle
you know what i'm sayin'? it's all good, baby baby

it was all a dream, i used to read word up  magazine
salt n pepa and heavy d up in the limousine
hangin' pictures on my wall
every saturday rap attack, mr. magic, marley marl
i let my tape rock 'til my tape popped
smokin' weed in bambú, sippin' on private stock
way back, when i had the red and black lumberjack
with the hat to match
remember rappin' duke? duh ha, duh ha
you never thought that hip hop would take it this far
now i'm in the limelight 'cause i rhyme tight
time to get paid, blow up like the world trade
born sinner, the opposite of a winner

i made the change from a common thief
to up close and personal with robin leach
and i'm far from cheap, i smoke skunk with my peeps all day
spread love, it's the brooklyn way
the mo t and aliz  keep me pissy, girls used to diss me
now they write letters 'cause they miss me
i never thought it could happen, this rapping stuff
i was too used to packing gats and stuff
now honeys play me close like butter play toast
from the mississippi down to the east coast
condos in queens, indo for weeks
sold out seats to hear biggie smalls speak
living life without fear
puttin' five karats in my baby girl ear
lunches, brunches, interviews by the pool
considered a fool 'cause i dropped out of high school
stereotypes of a black male misunderstood
and it's still all good
and if you don't know, now you know, nigga

you know very well
who you are
don't let 'em hold you down
reach for the stars
you had a goal
but not that many
'cause you're the only one

super nintendo, sega genesis

50 inch screen, money green leather sofa

phone bill about two g's flat

and my whole crew is loungin'
celebrating every day, no more public housin'
thinkin' back on my one room shack
now my mom pimps an ac' with minks on her back
and she loves to show me off of course
smiles every time my face is up in the source
we used to fuss when the landlord dissed us
no heat, wonder why christmas missed us

woop woop  that's the sound of da police
woop woop  that's the sound of da beast
woop woop  that's the sound of da police
woop woop  that's the sound of da beast
woop woop  that's the sound of da police
woop woop  that's the sound of da beast
woop woop  that's the sound of da police
woop woop  that's the sound of da beast

stand clear, don man'll talk
you can't stand where i stand, you can't walk where i walk
watch out, we run new york
policeman come, we bust him out the park
i know this for a fact, you don't like how i act
you claim i'm sellin' crack, but you be doin' that
i'd rather say see ya,  cause i would never be ya
be an officer? you wicked overseer 
you hotshot, wanna get props and be a savior
first show a little respect, change your behavior
change your attitude, change your plan
there could never really be justice on stolen land
are you really for peace and equality?
or when my car is hooked up, you know you wanna follow me
your laws are minimal
 cause you won't even think about lookin' at the real criminal
this has got to cease
 cause we be getting hyped to the sound of da police

woop woop  that's the sound of da police
woop woop  that's the sound of da beast
woop woop  that's the sound of da police
woop woop  that's the sound of da beast

now here's a likkle truth, open up your eye
while you're checkin' out the boom bap, check the exercise
take the word overseer, like a sample
repeat it very quickly in a crew, for example
overseer, overseer, overseer, overseer
officer, officer, officer, officer
yeah, officer from overseer
you need a little clarity? check the similarity 
the overseer rode around the plantation
the officer is off, patrollin' all the nation
the overseer could stop you, "what you're doing?"
the officer will pull you over just when he's pursuing
the overseer had the right to get ill
and if you fought back, the overseer had the right to kill
the officer has the right to arrest
and if you fight back they put a hole in your chest
 woop   they both ride horses
after 400 years, i've got no choices
the police them have a likkle gun
so when i'm on the streets, i walk around with a bigger one
 woop woop   i hear it all day
just so they can run the light and be upon their way

woop woop  that's the sound of da police
woop woop  that's the sound of da beast
woop woop  that's the sound of da police
woop woop  that's the sound of da beast

check out the message in a rough stylee
the real criminal are the c o p
you check for undercover and the one p.d
but just a mere black man, them wann check me
them check out me car, for it shine like the sun
but them jealous or them vexed,  cause them can't afford one
black people still slaves up 'til today
but the black police officer nah see it that way
him want a salary, him want it
so he put on a badge and kill people for it
my grandfather had to deal with the cops
my great grandfather dealt with the cops
my great grandfather had to deal with the cops
and then my great, great, great, great when it's gonna stop? 

woop woop  that's the sound of da police
woop woop  that's the sound of da beast
woop woop  that's the sound of da police
woop woop  that's the sound of da beast

trash men didn't get my trash today
oh, why? because they want more pay
buses on strike want a raise in fare
so they can help pollute the air

said, "i don't wanna fight
you can leave, but remember
i'm always on your side"

life isn't pretty we all get a little wrecked sometimes
if god's listening, people think you're out of your mind
even if you believe it
through all the hard times
i'm on your side
on your side
i'm on your side
on your side

on your side
life isn't pretty we all get a little wrecked sometimes
if god's listening, people think you're out of your mind
even if you believe it
through all the hard times
i'm on your side


i'm still alive but i'm barely breathing
just praying to a god that i don't believe in
'cause i got time while she got freedom
'cause when a heart breaks no it don't break even

her best days will be some of my worst
she finally met a man that's gonna put her first
while i'm wide awake she's no trouble sleeping
'cause when a heart breaks no it don't breakeven
even... no

what am i supposed to do when the best part of me was always you?
and what am i supposed to say when i'm all choked up and you're ok?
i'm falling to pieces, yeah
i'm falling to pieces

they say bad things happen for a reason
but no wise words gonna stop the bleeding
'cause she's moved on while i'm still grieving
and when a heart breaks no it don't breakeven even, even
... no

what am i gonna do when the best part of me was always you?
and what am i supposed to say when i'm all choked up and you're ok?
i'm falling to pieces, yeah
i'm falling to pieces, yeah
i'm falling to pieces
 one still in love while the other one's leaving 
i'm falling to pieces
 'cause when a heart breaks no it don't break even 

oh, you got his heart and my heart and none of the pain
you took your suitcase, i took the blame
now i'm tryna make sense of what little remains, oh
'cause you left me with no love and no love to my name

i'm still alive but i'm barely breathing
just prayed to a god that i don't believe in
'cause i got time while she got freedom
'cause when a heart breaks no it don't break
no it don't break no it don't break even no

what am i gonna do when the best part of me was always you?
and what am i supposed to say when i'm all choked up that you're ok?
i'm falling to pieces, yeah
i'm falling to pieces, yeah
i'm falling to pieces
 one still in love while the other one's leaving 
i'm falling to pieces
 'cause when a heart breaks no it don't break even

i rip a page out my notebook in anger
and let these thoughts linger, singing

cameras and action
may no man alive come through and damage my faction
i brought you niggas with me cause i love you like my brothers
and your mothers' like my mother
think we need a plan of action

like show me new york's ladder
i climb it and set the bar so high that you gotta get obama to force the air force to find it
never mind it, you'll never reach that
cole is the hypnotist, control the game whenever he snap
that's every track, nigga

don't give 'em too much you
don't let 'em take control
it's one thing you do
don't let 'em taint your soul
if you believe in god
one thing's for sure
if you ain't aim too high
then you aim too low

i ain't serve no pies, i ain't slang no dope

i don't play no games, boy i ain't no joke
like the great rakim, when i make my notes

i told my man duck,  cause i know where the missile fall
 cause the ice is a fortune teller for the rich or small
went to my man's crib who dead and saw his picture fall
i picked it up, his voice whispered, "nigga, ball "
so i smoke the finest,  85 for the ocean liners? 
i do it for the have not's, i'm at spot
that resembles screen savers on your lap tops
and niggas can't believe it like seeing that nigga zab drop

sip cream liqueur, green and blue fila velour's suits
boss smooth, the only thing i endorse duke
stash houses, gamble, i don't sweat a lawsuit

parisian linen garb and cashmere shirts


whose crew was realist? shot up the movie theaters?
times square '88, whose crew was in it?
 photographed was?  sittin' on wood wicker chairs
40oz in the lap, givin' off wicked stares
punch out kings, bustin' pistols in the air
hangin' out a cutlass supreme window like "bitch, come here"
girls cussing back at us with the fattest asses
like, "who you calling bitch?  little black bastards "
we had to wave the flag, here come they baby dad
drug dealers in the crazy jag looking crazy mad
they all thought they was sparkle, fucking killer men
but we was all black seeds as fred williamson
it was so simple, now i'm reflecting in this gold enzo
face it, my favorite trinket was that teddy riley guy bracelet
so now it's fly shit i'm draped in, customized shit i'm makin'

from the deepest of the darkest of night
on the horizon bright light enters sight, tight
cameras zoom on the impendin' doom
but then like  boom  black suits fill the room up
with the quickness talk with the witnesses
hypnotizer, neutralizer
vivid memories turn to fantasies

yeah, sendin' this one out
to my man killa b
no doubt indeed
where that weed?
nomsayin'?
that old real shit

there's a war goin' on outside no man is safe from
you could run, but you can't hide forever
from these streets that we done took
you walkin' with your head down, scared to look
you shook,  cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks
they never around when the beef cooks in my part of town
it's similar to vietnam
now we all grown up and old, and beyond the cops' control
they better have the riot gear ready
tryin' to bag me and get rocked steady
by the mac one double, i touch you
and leave you with not much to go home with
my skin is thick,  cause i be up in the mix of action
if i'm not at home, puffin' lye, relaxin'
new york got a nigga depressed
so i wear a slug proof underneath my guess
god bless my soul
before i put my foot down and begin to stroll
into the drama i built
and all unfinished beef, you will soon be killed
put us together, it's like mixin' vodka and milk
i'm goin out blastin', takin' my enemies with me
and if not, they scarred, so they will never forget me
lord, forgive me
the hennessy got me not knowin' how to act
i'm fallin' and i can't turn back
or maybe it's the words from my man killa black
that i can't say so it's left a untold fact
until my death, my goal's to stay alive
survival of the fit, only the strong survive

yo, yo, we livin' this 'til the day that we die
survival of the fit, only the strong survive
 we still livin' it 
we livin' this 'til the day that we die
survival of the fit, only the strong survive
 thug life, we still livin' it 
we livin' this 'til the day that we die
survival of the fit, only the strong survive
 we still livin' it 
we livin' this 'til the day that we die
survival of the fit, only the strong survive

i'm trapped, in between two worlds, tryin' to get dough
y'know, when the dough get low the jewels go
but never that, as long as fiends smoke crack
i'll be on the block hustlin', countin' my stacks
no doubt, watchin' my back and proceed with caution
five oh lurkin', no time to get lost in the system
niggas usin' fake names to get out quick
my brother did it and got bagged with two ounces
i live a world where squads hit the block hard
ask my man twin when he got bagged
that fucked me up, god, but shit happens for a reason
you find out who's your true peoples
when you're upstate bleedin'
you can't find a shorty to troop your bid with you
hit with a two to four is difficult
wild on the streets, i try to maintain
tight with my loot,  cause hoes like to run game
some niggas like to trick, but i ain't with that trickin' shit
i'm like a jew, savin' dough so i can big whip
pushin' a lex, now i'm set, ready to jet
no matter how much loot i get
i'm stayin' in the projects forever
jakes on the blocks we out clever
if beef, we never separate and pull together
when worse comes to worst, my peoples come first
try to react and get them motherfuckin' feelings hurt
my crew's all about loot fuck lookin' cute 
i'm strictly timb boots and army certified suits
puffin l's, laid back, enjoyin' the smell
in the bridge, gettin' down, it ain't hard to tell
you better realize

yo, yo, we livin' this 'til the day that we die
survival of the fit, only the strong survive
 we still livin' it 
we livin' this 'til the day that we die
survival of the fit, only the strong survive
 thug life, we still livin' it 
we livin' this 'til the day that we die
survival of the fit, only the strong survive
 we still livin' it 
we livin' this 'til the day that we die
survival of the fit, only the strong survive

knew that it was wrong the first night i met you
when i sneaked back into bed and you said, "i love you"
up in this house, blood runs cold
secret codes, are all we know

we gotta tear it all down, set it on fire
watch it burn to the ground, it kills us just a little
but a little's alright, 'cause, oh, it ain't forever
you'll find someone, find someone who loves you better
yeah, you'll find someone, find someone who loves you better
babe, you'll find the one, you'll find someone

your friends have always liked me but i told you that you shouldn't listen
'cause picking wings off of angels, has always been my religion
you been stickin' round far too long
and i've been runnin' round and it just feels wrong

we gotta tear it all down, set it on fire
watch it burn to the ground, it kills us just a little
but a little's alright, 'cause, oh, it ain't forever
you'll find someone, find someone who loves you better

aren't you somethin' to admire?
'cause your shine is somethin' like a mirror
and i can't help but notice
you reflect in this heart of mine
if you ever feel alone and
the glare makes me hard to find
just know that i'm always
parallel on the other side

'cause with your hand in my hand and a pocket full of soul
i can tell you there's no place we couldn't go
just put your hand on the past
i'm here tryna pull you through
you just gotta be strong

i don't wanna lose you now
i'm lookin' right at the other half of me
the vacancy that sat in my heart
is a space that now you hold
show me how to fight for now
and i'll tell you, baby, it was easy
comin' back here to you once i figured it out
you were right here all along
it's like you're my mirror  oh

i couldn't get any bigger  oh 
with anyone else beside me   oh 
and now it's clear as this promise
that we're making
two reflections into one
'cause it's like you're my mirror   oh 
my mirror staring back at me, staring back at me, staring back at me

aren't you somethin', an original?
'cause it doesn't seem merely assembled
and i can't help but stare, 'cause
i see truth somewhere in your eyes
i can't ever change without you
you reflect me, i love that about you
and if i could, i
would look at us all the time

'cause with your hand in my hand and a pocket full of soul
i can tell you there's no place we couldn't go
just put your hand on the past
i'm here tryna pull you through

tomorrow's a mystery, oh
i can see you lookin' back at me
keep your eyes on me
baby, keep your eyes on me

'cause i don't wanna lose you now

just to let you know, you are

yeah, yeah
ayo, black, it's time, word  word, it's time, man 
it's time, man  aight, man, begin 
yeah, straight out the fuckin' dungeons of rap
where fake niggas don't make it back
i don't know how to start this shit, yo... now

rappers   i monkey flip 'em with the funky rhythm i be kickin'
musician, inflictin', composition
of pain, i'm like scarface sniffin' cocaine
holdin' an m16, see with the pen i'm extreme
now, bullet holes left in my peepholes
i'm suited up in street clothes, hand me a 9 and i'll defeat foes
y'all know my steelo, with or without the airplay
i keep some e j, sittin' bent up in the stairway
or either on the corner bettin' grants with the cee lo champs
laughin' at base heads, tryna sell some broken amps...
g packs get off quick, forever niggas talk shit
reminiscin' about the last time the task force flipped
niggas be runnin' through the block shootin'
time to start the revolution, catch a body, head for houston
once they caught us off guard, the mac 10 was in the grass, and
i ran like a cheetah, with thoughts of an assassin
picked the mac up, told brothers "back up "   the mac spit
lead was hittin' niggas, one ran, i made him backflip
heard a few chicks scream, my arm shook, couldn't look
gave another squeeze, heard it click, "yo, my shit is stuck "
tried to cock it, it wouldn't shoot, now i'm in danger
finally pulled it back and saw 3 bullets caught up in the chamber
so, now i'm jettin' through the buildin' lobby
and it was full of children, prob'ly couldn't see as high as i be
 so, what you sayin'? 
it's like the game ain't the same
got younger niggas pullin' the triggers, bringin' fame to their name
and claim some corners, crews without guns are goners
in broad daylight, stick up kids, they run up on us
0.45 s and gauges, mac's in fact
same niggas will catch you back to back, snatchin' your cracks in black
there was a snitch on the block gettin' niggas knocked
so hold your stash 'til the coke price drop
i know this crackhead who said she got to smoke nice rock
and if it's good she'll bring you customers and measuring pots, but yo
you gotta slide on a vacation
inside information keeps large niggas erasin' and their wives basin'
it drops deep as it does in my breath
i never sleep, 'cause sleep is the cousin of death
beyond the walls of intelligence, life is defined
i think of crime when i'm in the new york state of mind

new york state of mind
new york state of mind
new york state of mind

be havin' dreams that i'm a gangsta, drinkin' mo ts, holdin' tec's
makin' sure the cash came correct, then i stepped
investments in stocks, sewin' up the blocks to sell rocks
winnin' gunfights with mega cops
but just a nigga walkin' with his finger on the trigger
make enough figures until my pockets get bigger
i ain't the type of brother made for you to start testin'
give me a smith   wesson, i have niggas undressin'
thinkin' of cash flow, buddha and shelter
whenever frustrated, i'ma hijack delta
in the pj's, my blend tape plays, bullets are strays
young bitches is grazed, each block is like a maze
full of black rats trapped plus the island is packed
from what i hear in all the stories when my peoples come back
black, i'm livin' where the nights is jet black
the fiends fight to get crack, i just max, i dream i can sit back
and lamp like capone, with drug scripts sewn
or the legal luxury life, rings flooded with stones, homes
i got so many rhymes, i don't think i'm too sane
life is parallel to hell, but i must maintain
and be prosperous, though we live dangerous
cops could just arrest me, blamin' us: we're held like hostages
it's only right that i was born to use mics
and the stuff that i write is even tougher than dykes
i've taken rappers to a new plateau
through rap slow, my rhymin' is a vitamin held without a capsule
the smooth criminal on beat breaks
never put me in your box if your shit eats tapes
the city never sleeps, full of villains and creeps
that's where i learned to do my hustle, had to scuffle with freaks
i'm a addict for sneakers, 20s of buddha and bitches with beepers
in the streets i can greet ya, about blunts i teach ya
inhale deep like the words of my breath
i never sleep 'cause sleep is the cousin of death
i lay puzzle as i backtrack to earlier times
nothing's equivalent to the new york state of mind

new york state of mind
new york state of mind
new york state of mind
new york state of mind

we got the jazz, we got the jazz
we got the jazz, we got the jazz
we got the jazz, we got the jazz
we got the jazz, we got the jazz

stern firm and young with a laid back tongue
the aim is to succeed and achieve at 21
just like ringling brothers, i'll daze and astound
captivate the mass, cause the prose was profound
do it for the strong, we do it for the meek
boom it in your boom it in your boom it in your jeep
or your honda or your beemer or your legend or your benz
the rave of the town to your foes and your friends
so push it, along, trails, we blaze
don't deserve the gong, don't deserve the praise
the tranquility will make you unball your fist
for we put hip hop on a brand new twist
a brand new twist with a whole heap of mystic
so low key that you probably missed it
and yet it's so loud that it stands in the crowd
when the guy takes the beat, they bowed
so raise up squire, adjust your attire
we have no time to wallow in the mire
if you're on a foreign path, then let me do the lead
join in the essence of the cool out breed
then cool out to the music cause it makes you feel serene
with the birds and the bees and all those groovy things
like getting stomach aches when you gotta go to work
or staring into space when you're feeling berserk
i don't really mind if it's over your head
cause the job of resurrectors is to wake up the dead
so pay attention, it's not hard to decipher
and after the horns, you can check out the phifer

we got the jazz, we got the jazz
we got the jazz, we got the jazz
we got the jazz, we got the jazz
we got the jazz, we got the jazz

so jet to the store, and buy the lp
on jive rca, cassettes and cd's
produced and arranged by the four man crew
and oh shit, skeff anselm, he gets props too
make sure you have a system with some fat house speakers
so the new shit can rock, from bronx to massapequa
cause where i come from quality is job one
and everybody up on linden know we get the job done
so peace to that crew, and peace to this crew
bring on the tour, we'll see you at a theatre nearest you

hey yo but wait, back it up, hup, easy back it up
please let the abstract embellish on the cut
back and forth just like a cameo song
if you dig this joint then please come dance along
to the music cause it's done just for the rhyme
now i gotta scat and get mine, underline
the jazz, the what? the jazz can move that ass
cause the tribe originates that feeling of pizazz
it's the universal sound, bless the brothers on the ground
and the ones six below, you didn't have to go
some say that i'm eccentric cause i once had an orgy
and sometimes for breakfast i eat grits and porgies
if this is a stinker, then call me a skunk, i ask
 "what's, wrong?"  now check it out

all this world could give
and i told you when you left me
there's nothing to forgive
but i always thought you'd come back, tell me all you found was
heartbreak and misery

i'm wondering who you lay next to
oh, i'm jealous of the nights

heartbreak and misery

you're happy without me

as i sink in the sand
watch you slip through my hands
oh, as i die here another day
cause all i do is cry behind this smile

i wished you the best of
all this world could give
and i told you when you left me
there's nothing to forgive
but i always thought you'd come back, tell me all you found was
heartbreak and misery
it's hard for me to say, i'm jealous of the way
you're happy without me

it's hard for me to say, i'm jealous of the way
you're happy without me
