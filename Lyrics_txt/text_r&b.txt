

new breed
stop calling me ambitious when i dream farther than curry's three point range
it's not a compliment when you doubt my success in a polite way
i'm used to being the underdog 'cause black girls who have minds and a cause are stifled with leashes and clich s
but we new breeds
we run over insults and fuck niggas like bobby boucher
we new breeds
we coast over doubts like tony hawk in the prime of his x games

i had to be the one to learn the shit the hard way
pick up the pieces even though i wasn't the one to blame
no excuses 'cause it only made up my game
grind up, gotta keep my grind up
i wasn't chasing nothing that was never mine to take
rockin' the best, dressed head to toe in my mistakes
i got that type of shit, that type of shit don't ever fade
shine up, gotta keep my shine up

so won't you put that pressure on me?
'cause then you'll see the best in me

darling, you ain't notice
but that don't mean we ain't diamonds
and even though we're broken
that don't mean we ain't diamonds
i know that we ain't polished
but that don't mean we ain't diamonds
we rough around the edges
but that don't mean we ain't diamonds

what i got up in my pocket don't come easily
i had to drop it off gwaf it ain't pleasing me
never play with people that's prepared to cheat on me
eyes up, got to keep your eyes up
i wake up every morning and i'm feeling hella free
paid my dues so i can do this shit the way i please
i've been on my grind, i've been waiting patiently
hustle up, gotta keep your hustle up

so won't you put that pressure on me?
'cause then you'll see the best in me

darling, you ain't notice
but that don't mean we ain't diamonds  that don't mean we 
and even though we're broken
that don't mean we ain't diamonds  we 
i know that we ain't polished
but that don't mean we ain't diamonds  that don't mean 
we rough around the edges
but that don't mean we ain't diamonds

we were made under the weight of mountains
so we can take whatever you throw at us

darling, you ain't notice
but that don't mean we ain't diamonds
and even though we're broken
that don't mean we ain't diamonds
i know that we ain't polished
but that don't mean we ain't diamonds
we rough around the edges
but that don't mean we ain't diamonds  no, no, no, no, no, no 

some people live for the fortune
some people live just for the fame
some people live for the power, yeah
some people live just to play the game
some people think that the physical things
define what's within
and i've been there before but that life's a bore
so full of the superficial
some people want it all
but i don't want nothing at all
if it ain't you, baby
if i ain't got you, baby
some people want diamond rings
some just want everything
but everything means nothing
if i ain't got you, yeah

that promises forever young
some people need three dozen roses
and that's the only way to prove you love him
hand me the world on a silver platter
and what good would it be?
with no one to share
with no one who truly cares for me
some people want it all
but i don't want nothing at all

can't be explained, but i can try for you

caroline but i had to make it rhyme, i'm
addicted to that weather like heroin
that is why i cannot give it any time, just say no 
it's too good to me, you are too good to me
o.d. on compliments, i need some oxygen
so i dip to the pnw, some of ya don't need where that is   good 
need a little solitude with my crew
'membering what's real is what makes you you, oh 
it's too good to me, know it's no good for me
i can't be out here homie, what it used to be
sitting in bed like "man ", wishing
itching for days with no end
sound checks, checks in, audiences rapping
getting full of that adrenaline, eat it up like satan
you can't have it? take it, you can't man up? k then
breaking up my cadence, got that willpower like jaden, blaow 

and we keep it going up
make it go around, around, again
and we keep it going up
going up
and we keep it going up
make it go around, around, again
and we keep it going up
going up

flying into paris with sophia eris
had a heart to heart over fresh croissant
wondering why these dudes be tripping
she like "girl i'm past giving a damn "
yolo, guess that's why he want a photo
dressed in polo, arm around me after the show
but never there when i need hoes
open mind but my heart closed, ah 
where ya been? back again, young man?
i remember you from way way when
you never gave it or reciprocated
but when i bounced for my sake, you peeped your mistake
"she left me" is always the excuse
i swear there should be support groups for men without lizzo
meet once a week and deal with y'all issues
google me and jack off in a tissue

yeah  you know what though?
we keep it going up
make it go around, around, again
and we keep it going up
going up
and we keep it going up
make it go around, around, again
and we keep it going up
going up

i will never be the person that you want me to
feeling like i can't amount in what i'm 'sposed to do
but i'm here now, like how this happen?
head in the pillows, i'm crunching on cap'n
i'm chilling, i swear i been chilling
taking a break, feeling hella breakable
i was taught that life has no regrets and no mistakes, no no
bet i made some, granted
but my heart cold bruh, definitely definitely granite
wrote this song halfway to chicago
wondering if i should call you
what, to make you feel special?
would it give me reasons to forget you?
 hey, you reached lizzo. leave me a message.. 
i'm out of state, out of time
you more like out of sight, out of mind

yeah  you know what though?
we keep it going up
make it go around, around, again
and we keep it going up
going up
and we keep it going up
make it go around, around, again
and we keep it going up
going up

i done went through just about two bags of tissues baby
and you're looking at me like you ain't the issue baby
and though i tried to leave, i can't stop missing you baby
and i keep coming, i keep coming back
 hook 
i keep going in circles, circles
'round and 'round
and while you're doing me so wrong
i just keep holding you down
i feel so stupid, foolish
loving you all this way
but what i can i say
but i wanna go
i wanna go but i keep coming back
 verse 2 
why i'm so confused for you, i have no answer boy  one time  
when i feel so used by you just like a toy  two times  
it's a shame that you don't care enough to even give me half the love i give to you
i live for you baby
i'm ashamed to say that i'm to blame for how you act
cause i keep coming, i keep coming back
 hook 
i can't stop
i can't stop
i can't stop missing you baby
i can't stop
 bridge

in an hour when i wake up
i mma take a little time and bring up
the fact that we did break up
and just for one night we made up
and we made love, and it was so good
that sweet, rough, that funky stuff
i can tell by your moans, you ain't get enough

now you're looking at me with faces
cause i went two different places
you're thinking it's a new beginning
when i know that it's the ending
we ended our time for a reason
our trouble was never pleasing
each other we got the right seeds done
that ain't enough to plant our dreams in
oh i want some sugar in my bowl

distance was a friend of mine
catching breath in a web of lies
i've spent most of my life
riding waves, playing acrobat
shadowboxing the other half
learning how to react
i've spent most of my time

catching my breath, letting it go
turning my cheek for the sake of the show
now that you know, this is my life
i won't be told what's supposed to be right

catch my breath
no one can hold me back, i ain't got time for that
catch my breath
won't let 'em get me down, it's all so simple now

addicted to the love i found
heavy heart, now a weightless cloud
making time for the ones that count
i'll spend the rest of my time
laughing hard with the windows down
leaving footprints all over town
keeping faith, karma comes around
i will spend the rest of my life

catching my breath, letting it go
turning my cheek for the sake of the show
now that you know, this is my life
i won't be told what's supposed to be right

catch my breath
no one can hold me back, i ain't got time for that
catch my breath
won't let 'em get me down, it's all so simple now

you helped me see
the beauty in everything

catching my breath, letting it go
turning my cheek for the sake of the show
now that you know, this is my life
i won't be told what's supposed to be right
catching my breath, letting it go
turning my cheek for the sake of the show
now that you know, this is my life
i won't be told what's supposed to be right

catch my breath
catch my breath
no one can hold me back, i ain't got time for that
catch my breath
won't let 'em get me down, it's all so simple now
it's all so simple now

catching my breath, letting it go
turning my cheek for the sake of the show
now that you know, this is my life
i won't be told what's supposed to be right

catch my breath
catch my breath
no one can hold me back, i ain't got time for that
catch my breath
catch my breath  catch my breath 
won't let 'em get me down, it's all so simple now

hey love time to get up
i think you ve been sleeping too long
my day started when you were still yawning
one room just ain t enough
when it s two folks trying to get along
but it s hard to leave you alone

oh love is always better
when we take time to get back to who we are
when we are apart
distance makes the heart grow
even when i m lonely
happy knowing that your love is never far
when we are apart
distance makes the heart

it makes the leaves on the trees fall
it makes the hours in the day long
makes me wanna clear my head
find a little cafe and write the words to a song
and i know that i m still free
be anywhere that i wanna be
maybe get dressed up
wear something real pretty that you ain t never seen

oh love is always better
when we take time to get back to who we are
when we are apart
distance makes the heart grow
even when i m lonely
happy knowing that your love is never far
when we are apart
distance makes the..

when you love it makes the heart
when you trust it makes the heart
when you call it makes it heart
we re alone, when we re apart
in the middle of a fight
walk away to make it right
where we go we re never far
in the light or in the dark
on a plane up in the stars
in a movie or at the bar
home alone or out to tea
look to your heart and think of me
i wanna love you
don t wanna try to change the pace of your life
we get together we make it good
we get together, ooh..

hey love time to get up
i think you ve been sleeping too long
my day started when you were still yawning


maybe i'll win, maybe i'll never play
maybe i'll lose, maybe i'll leave the game
something calling, don't know where i'm going
i feel it in my veins
had some tough breaks in this town, heaven knows
seen some heart aches, weighed me down like a stone
well, i licked my wounds, i got nothing to lose
i'm headed out on my own

i'll never go back
i'll never go back
you'll never change that
i'll never go back

will i make it? will i taste victory?
will i give in or will i risk it on me?
all this reminiscing and wishing things were different
has brought me down to my knees
kiss my mother, tell her i'll be okay
couldn't stay here, had to find my own way
well, there's something better, there's got to be better
i know i'm gonna find it some day

i'll never go back
i'll never go back
you'll never change that
i'll never go back

ooh, i can't expect to find a feeling like that again
no, i won't pretend
oh, i know there's something waiting down this road ahead
i'll find it in the end
find it in the end

go back, go back
go back, go back
go back, go back
go back, go back  oh no, i won't go, no, i won't, i won't 
go back, go back

i didn't come here to hurt you, now i can't stop

i want you to know that it doesn't matter
where we take this road
someone's gotta go
and i want you to know you couldn't have loved me better
but i want you to move on, so i'm already gone

looking at you makes it harder
but i know that you'll find another
that doesn't always make you wanna cry
it started with a perfect kiss then
we could feel the poison set in
"perfect" couldn't keep this love alive
you know that i love you so, i love you enough to let you go

i want you to know that it doesn't matter
where we take this road
someone's gotta go
and i want you to know you couldn't have loved me better
but i want you to move on, so i'm already gone
i'm already gone, already gone
you can't make it feel right when you know that it's wrong
i'm already gone, already gone
there's no moving on, so i'm already gone

ahh, already gone, already gone, already gone  ooh, oh 
ahh, already gone, already gone, already gone, yeah

remember all the things we wanted
now all our memories, they're haunted
we were always meant to say goodbye

i want you to know that it doesn't matter
where we take this road
someone's gotta go
and i want you to know you couldn't have loved me better
but i want you to move on, so i'm already gone

i'm already gone, already gone
you can't make it feel right when you know that it's wrong
i'm already gone, already gone
there's no moving on, so i'm already gone


oh, it hurts the most 'cause i don't know the cause
maybe i shouldn't have cried when you left and told me not to wait
oh, it kills the most to say that i still care
now i'm left tryna rewind the times you held and kissed me back

i wonder if you're thinking "is she alright all alone?"
i wonder if you tried to call, but couldn't find your phone
have i ever crossed your thoughts because your name's all over mine?
a moment in time, don't watch me cry
a moment in time, don't watch me cry

i'm not crying 'cause you left me on my own
i'm not crying 'cause you left me with no warning
i'm just crying 'cause i can't escape what could've been
are you aware when you set me free?
all i can do is let my heart bleed

oh, it's harder when you can't see through the thoughts
not that i wanna get in, but i want to see how your mind works
no, it's harder when they don't know what they've done
thinking it's better they leave, meaning that i'll have to move on

oh, i wonder if you're thinking "is she alright all alone?"
i wonder if you tried to call, but couldn't find your phone
have i ever crossed your thoughts because your name's all over mine?
a moment in time, don't watch me cry
a moment in time, don't watch me cry

i'm not crying 'cause you left me on my own
i'm not crying 'cause you left me with no warning
i'm just crying 'cause i can't escape what could've been
are you aware when you set me free?
all i can do is let my heart bleed

she said she's tired that i'm always on the road
too hard to swallow being alone
she needs someone at night that she can hold
she must have told me a thousand times before
silent cries i use to ignore
god knows i love her
didn't mean to hurt her

baby i'll be
sitting here waiting on you to come home again
i won't leave
promise i'll be here to the very end
by your side
to protect you and to love you and to be with you for life
come on home to me charlene

she knows i really love this old music thing
since i was a child it's been my dream
i can support her treat her and spoil her
you know buy her the finer things
but i forgot about loving her
damn the money, diamonds, and pearls
what about the hard day she had with the baby
all she need is for me to love her

baby i'll be
sitting here waiting on you to come home again
i won't leave
promise i'll be here to the very end
by your side
to protect you and to love you and to be with you for life
come on home to me charlene

and it hurts so bad that's she gone away
i pray that she'll come back one day
in my life

by your side
to protect you and to love you and to be with you for life

oh oh oh
sometimes i cry
charlene if you're listening would you call on me
because my heart is aching

it's not difficult
for me to say i love you
it wouldn't be difficult
if you would say the same
and believe me when i tell you
that i know you very well
i know you like i know my name
i think that i have met you
somewhere in my dreams
i may never have met you at all
and i know you must be thinking
"what a silly girl"
i know your every thought and scheme
i wake up to the feeling each morning
i go to bed to it at night
i know you, i live you
like i feel the sun in the morning
like i see the moon at night
i know you as if i've known you all my life
i know you, i live you
one day you'll realize
we're not strangers
you'll open up your eyes
and know me too
and you'll see that we were
meant to be together, my dear
and now the rest is up to you
i wake up to the feeling each morning
go to bed to it at night
i know you, i know you
like i feel the sun in the morning

thing may not always go right for you
in those times
just leave it behind

just to survive
without losing yourself

it takes time
don't have all the answers
no matter how hard it gets
hold on to what's inside

don't never let nobody tear your world apart
look in the mirrow and see who you are
beautiful u r
in the dark
the paint chips have weighted your heart
so deep
can't you see
see the light in the distance
open up your eye, look, look to the sky
and believe
there's much more to life when you're free
that's the key and in time
you will find all the answers
don't have to lose your pride
hold on to what's inside
don't never let nobody bring you down, girl
don't never let nobody tear your world apart
look in the mirrow and see who you are
beautiful u r
don't never let nobody bring you down, girl
don't never let nobody tear your world apart
look in the mirrow and see who you are
beautiful u r
don't care what they say anymore
there's no time to be insecure
i leave it all at the door
she staring at him in the face
she's taking it day by day
i'm finally on my way
don't never let nobody bring you down, girl
don't never let nobody tear your world apart
look in the mirrow and see who you are
beautiful u r
don't never let nobody bring you down, girl

whether for worse or better
time s been working against us since forever
it could really work if we work together
but what happens when one wants too much
do we let it go or

do we give it another try
or finally find the good in a goodbye
maybe right one, but wrong time, but it s cool
either way it goes, we re never in control because

we try to decide in our minds who s right
heaven only knows
we like to tell ourselves little lies to get by
heaven only knows
we don t even know if whether things ll ever get better
or not, we tried so why not move on with your life
don t make no sense wasting your time
heaven only knows

yeah, i know it hurts but it gets better
try to ride out the storm and weather the weather
why settle for less than you want?
you can t ignore you need more than smoke and mirrors
you ll get what you deserve  what you deserve 
when you know just how much you re worth
nothing less than someone who will put you first
either way it goes, you re never in control because

we try to decide in our minds who s right
heaven only knows
we like to tell ourselves little lies to get by
heaven only knows
we don t even know if whether things ll ever get better
or not, we tried so why not move on with your life
don t make no sense wasting your time
heaven only knows

heaven only know  heaven only knows 
heaven only knows
thought you had somebody  but it didn t work 
when you play with love  sometimes it hurts 
you re thinking life is over  but it could be worse 
when it s really up to the stars  and the universe 
in the meantime, don t be sittin  around feeling sorry for yourself
 need to let it go 
 cause right now might be the right time to love somebody else
 heaven only knows 
it s not up to you, you don t get to choose
love has its own rules, just let it come to you

'cause we try to decide in our minds who s right
heaven only knows
we like to tell ourselves little lies to get by
heaven only knows
we don t even know if whether things ll ever get better
or not, we tried so why not move on with your life
don t make no sense wasting your time
heaven only knows

i'm sick of playing all of these games
it's not about taking sides
when i looked in the mirror
it didn't deliver, it hurt enough to think that i could stop

admit that i'm wrong
and then change my mind
sorry but i got to be strong
and leave you behind

i can't waste time so give it a moment
i realize nothing's broken
no need to worry 'bout everything i've done
live every second like it was my last one
don't look back at a new direction
i loved you once
needed protection

the answer that heaven has sent down to me

sweet destiny
and i'll be eternally grateful

if you took it upon yourself to take your self so literal
you're missing on the minerals to liberate your inner liberal
generally i don't give a rat's patootie

so here's my battle cry against those who slew me, who never knew me
 big girl, small world

and i'm doing all this for the w e?

getting dirt for the turf like a workaholic
but your worth cop a shirt 'cuz you work is na na
niggahs can't pay rent putting hustle in their mou mou
grasp for the raps for the stack when they can. do
slack, and i have to attack and offend you
smashing these tracks...and that's what i'm into

lookin like a girl cause i'm keeping it youthful
such a freakin lady, classy and beautiful
thinking like a man, for those who don't understand
is having two grips to gain the upper hand
if you had the courage to give me reprimand to my face
instead of slight of hand, you da man 
 my employees no i me 



toe to toe, dancing very close
barely breathing, almost comatose
wall to wall, people hypnotised
and they're stepping lightly
hang each night in rapture

back to back, sacroiliac
spineless movements and a wild attack
face to face, sadly solitude
and it's finger pop
it's 24 hour shopping in rapture

fab five freddie told me everybody fly
dj's spinning i said my oh my
flash is fast, flash is cool
francois sais pas, flashe no deux
and you don't stop, sure shot
you go out to the parking lot
and you get in your car and you drive real far
and you drive all night, then you see a light
and it comes right down and lands on the ground
and out comes a man from mars
and you try to run, but he's got a gun
and he shoots you dead and he eats your head
then you're in the man from mars
and you go out at night, eatin' cars
you eat cadillacs, lincolns, too, mercuries and subarus
and you don't stop, you keep on eatin' cars
then, when there's no more cars
you go out at night and you eat up bars
where the people meet face to face, dance cheek to cheek
one to one, man to man, dance toe to toe
don't move too slow, 'cause the man from mars
is through with cars, he's eatin' bars
yeah, wall to wall, door to door
hall to hall, he's gonna eat 'em all
rapture, be pure

and you'll be singin' in the rain

don't stop, do the punk rock
don't stop, do the punk rock
don't stop, do the punk rock
well now you see what you wanna be
just have your party on tv
'cause the man from mars won't eat up bars
when the, uh, when the tv's on
and now he's gone back up to space
where he won't have a hassle with the human race
and you hip hop, and you don't stop
just blast off, sure shot
'cause the man from mars stopped eatin' cars and eatin' bars
and he only eats guitars, get up
and he only eats guitars, get up
and he only eats guitars, get up

the tolerance for ho ishness that some of you people have
"me?" you, yeah you

walking around your cubicle, your tie with your coffee mug
syphoning the hard earned work from the thugs and hustlers, cuz
takin a chill pill before i whip my sword out like uma in kill bill
makin niggas gasp like emmitt till
and i'mma keep on giving you the gospel like god's will, peace  be still

can i fall in love before the world ends?
can my record get a few major spins? i'm saying
i don't wanna think about tomorrow because i'm still hustling
until then, i guess it's just me, you, theses food stamps and cravings
no raisins in the sun, just funyins and a sunkist, we up in the club making it mist
like a missed alcohol  though i see it every night 
and that tylenol i take everyday period like midil
bye y'all, i'm moving on to other things by y'all
but not quite bilateral, more like three floors up and down the hall
let the bygones be bygones, and try to keep the peace like obama and biden
all my friends are talented, all my friends got mad skills
all my girlfriends wear heels, all my niggas drug deal
we're tight  psych

heavy words, little lies
telling everything but the truth, the truth
three little words over time overheard and overused, used
no sweet nothing could ever be turned into something new
no grand gesture could ever be made to measure you

i know what i got and i know where we're going
you don't need to show it, i already know it all

it's what you don't do, it's what you don't say
 it's what you don't do  i know you love me, i don't need proof
it's what you don't do, the games you don't play
 it's what you don't do  i know you love me, i don't need proof

i've been saving up my time so i could spend it all on you, on you
oh, all i need is to see you smile; i've forgotten how to be blue, blue

i know what i got and i know where we're going
you don't need to show it, i already know it all

it's what you don't do, it's what you don't say
 it's what you don't do  i know you love me, i don't need proof
it's what you don't do, the games you don't play
 it's what you don't do  i know you love me, i don't need proof
don't tell the whole world; just wanna be your girl
 it's what you don't do, it's what you don't do 

the closer we get, oh
the less we need to show

i know what i got and i know where we're going
you don't need to show it, i already know it all

it's what you don't do, it's what you don't say
 it's what you don't do, it's what you don't do 

oh, the closer we get, oh
the less we need to show


nobody's buying
there ain't any truth to it
the fact is you're lying
but i'm getting used to it
promising we'll stay together
down in your heart, you know better
i know what i lost before it's gone

tell me slowly
over and over again
same old story
over and over again
tell me slowly
over and over again
over and over again

oh, say i'm overreacting
as if you believe in that
but you answer questions
that nobody even asked
although we may stay together
down in your heart, you know better
you pictured all the ways that you'll move on

but you just tell me slowly
over and over again
same old story
over and over again
tell me slowly
over and over again
over and over again

i will try to pull the wool over my eyes
you thought it would keep me warm
you said it was cold outside

tell me slowly
over and over again
same old stories
over and over again
tell me slowly
over and over again
over and over again
over and over again
over and over again

i'm not a girl
not yet a woman
all i need is time
a moment that is mine
while i'm in between

i'm not a girl
there is no need to protect me
it's time that i
learn to face up to this on my own
i've seen so much more than you know now
so don't tell me to shut my eyes

i'm not a girl  not a girl, not yet a woman 
not yet a woman
 i'm just trying to find the woman in me 
all i need is time
a moment that is mine
while i'm in between

i'm not a girl
but if you look at me closely
you will see it in my eyes
this girl will always find her way

i'm not a girl
i'm not a girl, don't tell me what to believe
not yet a woman
i'm just trying to find the woman in me, yeah
 all i need is time  all i need is time

"never look back," we said
how was i to know i'd miss you so?
loneliness up ahead, emptiness behind
where do i go?
and you didn't hear
all my joy through my tears
all my hopes through my fears
did you know still i miss you somehow?

from the bottom of my broken heart
there's just a thing or two i'd like you to know
you were my first love, you were my true love
from the first kisses to the very last rose
from the bottom of my broken heart
even though time may find me somebody new
you were my real love
i never knew love 'til there was you
from the bottom of my broken heart

"baby," i said, "please stay
give our love a chance for one more day"
we could've worked things out
taking time is what love's all about
but you put a dart
through my dreams, through my heart
and i'm back where i started again
never thought it would end

from the bottom of my broken heart  my broken heart 
there's just a thing or two i'd like you to know
you were my first love, you were my true love
from the first kisses to the very last rose
from the bottom of my broken heart
even though time may find me somebody new
you were my real love
i never knew love 'til there was you
from the bottom of my broken heart

you promised yourself
but to somebody else
and you made it so perfectly clear
still i wish you were here

from the bottom of my broken heart
there's just a thing or two i'd like you to know
you were my first love, you were my true love
from the first kisses to the very last rose
from the bottom of my broken heart
even though time may find me somebody new
 you were my real love  you were my real love
i never knew love 'til there was you
from the bottom of my broken heart

"never look back," we said
how was i to know i'd miss you so?


you know the bed feels warmer
sleeping here alone
you know i dream in color
and do the things i want

you think you got the best of me
think you've had the last laugh
bet you think that everything good is gone
think you left me broken down
think that i'll come running back
baby, you don't know me, 'cause you're dead wrong

what doesn't kill you makes you stronger
stand a little taller
doesn't mean i'm lonely when i'm alone
what doesn't kill you makes a fighter
footsteps even lighter
doesn't mean i'm over 'cause you're gone
what doesn't kill you makes you stronger, stronger
just me, myself, and i
what doesn't kill you makes you stronger
stand a little taller
doesn't mean i'm lonely when i'm alone

you heard that i was starting over with someone new
they told you i was moving on and over you

you didn't think that i'd come back
i'd come back swinging
you tried to break me, but you see

what doesn't kill you makes you stronger
stand a little taller
doesn't mean i'm lonely when i'm alone
what doesn't kill you makes a fighter
footsteps even lighter
doesn't mean i'm over 'cause you're gone
what doesn't kill you makes you stronger, stronger
just me, myself, and i
what doesn't kill you makes you stronger
stand a little taller
doesn't mean i'm lonely when i'm alone

thanks to you, i got a new thing started
thanks to you, i'm not the broken hearted
thanks to you i'm finally thinkin' 'bout me
you know in the end, the day you left was just my beginning
in the end

what doesn't kill you makes you stronger
stand a little taller
doesn't mean i'm lonely when i'm alone
what doesn't kill you makes a fighter
footsteps even lighter
doesn't mean i'm over 'cause you're gone
what doesn't kill you makes you stronger, stronger
just me, myself, and i
what doesn't kill you makes you stronger
stand a little taller
doesn't mean i'm lonely when i'm alone
what doesn't kill you makes you stronger, stronger
just me, myself, and i
what doesn't kill you makes you stronger
stand a little taller
doesn't mean i'm lonely when i'm alone

 when i'm alone 


i came in with my level up
watch them bitches kept that 4 page level up
feeling like mj with the glitter glove
pimp slap a nigga wit a misses in the buff
same city, i'm an la citizen
with the bad bitches and that sticky icky cinnabon
all i'm rollin', they follow mozes
you got the wave, i split the ocean
smell the roses, pop the ros  with my potion
baby chill, take a pill here's a dosage
she just want a picture for the poster
and i'm posing like i'm praying at the photo doesn't focus
yeah, yeah, dita frames, kill the glass
say you shine, i don't see it
keep tryin', no design like me though
know that i'm the coolest nigga since sub zero
i just need a..

pool full of money, i'ma dive in it
i'm just tryna eat, no diet in it
get her wet, then i dive in it
pussy so good, i would die in it

all black widow maker
and a trunk in the back like a winnebago
wake up in the mornin' and i lie in it
turn around and i hit it like a lineman
do the heisman, all up in your hymen
sippin' on tequilla sun rise with the lime in
i'm gettin' high, but it's lowerin' my eye lids
still see you niggas, i don't know just what the hype is
say you run the game, look more like a stroller, troller
what you gon' do, what you doin'
me and my dogs through the door like some doberman
stay inside your lane like bowling, you bogus
i need my way, young carlito
this feelin' al pacino in moschino
and the marina my emmy: iggy marino
look how we pass the reefer
i just need a...

pool full of money, i'ma dive in it
i'm just tryna eat, no diet in it
get her wet, then i dive in it
pussy so good, i would die in it

okay, yeah, it's kid ink
aw yeah, aw yeah
aw yeah, aw yeah
aw yeah, aw yeah
i see them lookin' through my side eye
they just sittin' on the sideline
i stand up and throw my sign at them
alumni i'ma die with them


maybe i am foolishly in love with
someone that is
not exactly on the same page that i am on
well, all my friends keep telling me stop
walking round so blindly
but when he calls they're not around
to ever remind me

maybe this isn't love
but if it isn't love
then really what is love?
maybe i will never really know what's love
'cause when he's around
he's got me feeling some kind of way
maybe this isn't love
but if it isn't love
then really what is love?
maybe i don't need to know
what's really love
'cause when he's around
he's got me feeling some kind of way

i guess i kind of notice
he don't always act so kindly
but that doesn't stop my hunger
hunger for his heart
now should i listen to those
who think that i should move on
maybe what they see as drama
i see more as art


can't seem to get past how he makes me feel
may not be love but it feels so real
can't go with what they say
must follow my heart
but now is that even being true to me
maybe i'm happy, truly content
maybe this is as good as it gets
do i have faith in my confidence
or am i just thinking all hopelessly
 x2
got me feeling some type of way ...
music fades out

can you just stay through the night?
turn down the bed and the blinds
before you turn around
can you just stay through the night?
let me breathe you in 'til gravity bends
and we fall through the hole in the light
make this our kingdom
somewhere where good love conquers and not divides

cause i may not know a lot of things but
i feel it in my chest
know i won't let the blue flame die
we can't lose hope just yet
'cause it's once, just once in a lifetime
and we're scared to love but it's alright
i may not know a lot of things but
i know that we're surefire, yeah
know that we're surefire, yeah

can't keep this bed warm on the left side
when something is cold as a goodbye
why don't you turn around?
ignore all that shit from the outside
the world is a nightmare
wake up and stay here
let me be on your side
we'll make this our kingdom
somewhere where good love conquers and not divides

and oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my god
i'm so, i'm so, i'm so tired of fighting
let go, give in, let go and give up, oh

i may not know a lot of things but
i feel it in my chest
know i won't let the blue flame die
we can't lose hope just yet
'cause it's once, just once in a lifetime
and we're scared to love but it's alright
i may not know a lot of things but
i know that we're surefire
know that we're surefire

and oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my god
i'm so, i'm so, i'm so tired of fighting
let go, give in, let go and give up, oh

i may not know a lot of things but
i feel it in my chest
if we just let the blue flame die
the devil wins this bet
oh it's once, just once in a lifetime
and you're scared to love but it's alright
i may not know a lot of things but
i know that we're surefire
know that we're surefire

gabrielle, that was her name
everyone was smiling, dreamin' through their tears, under a spell
but in gabby's eyes, nothing
i asked do you not like the music?
she says it's alright
but she dances to her own sad tune, she said
take me away from here
take me somewhere where love is like breathing
i don't care where we go, long as i'm there with you, baby
long as i'm there with you
i could tell, she's been through pain i could only dream
nightmares to live where you live
tears well in her eyes, but she wouldn't let them fall
i'd give the world to know where her smile is
i asked will you dance with me now
let me try to figure out
the fastest route out of town and she says
take me away from here
take me somewhere, where love is like breathing
i don't care where we go, long as i'm there with you baby
oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, i got a full tank of gas, girl
anywhere you wanna go, girl
all you have to do is ask girl, ohh she said
take me away from here
take me somewhere, where love is like breathing
i don't care where we go, long as i'm there with you baby
come on and take me away from here
take me somewhere, where love is like breathing

when you get what you want, but not what you need

when you love someone, but it goes to waste

and ignite your bones
and i will try to fix you

and high up above or down below

just what you're worth

and ignite your bones
and i will try to fix you


tears stream down your face
when you lose something you cannot replace
tears stream down your face
and i

tears stream down your face
i promise you i will learn from my mistakes
tears stream down your face
and i

lights will guide you home
and ignite your bones
and i will try to fix you

i just left my baby girl a message
sayin' i won't be coming home
i'd rather be alone
she doesn't fully understand me
cause i'd rather leave than to cheat
if she gives me some time
i can be the man she needs
but there's a lot of lust inside of me
and we've been together since our teenage years
i really don't mean to hurt her, but i need some time
to be alone

but when you love someone
you just don't treat them bad
oh, how i feel so sad

that you would play a major part
in a decision that's so hard
do i leave, do i stay, do i go?
or think about my life and what matters to me the most
girl, the love that we share is real
but in time your heart will heal
i'm not saying i'm gone, but i
have to find what life is like
without you

but when you love someone
you just don't treat them bad
oh, how i feel so sad

i can understand how the edges are rough
and they cut you like the tiniest slivers of glass
and you feel too much
and you don't know how long you're gonna last

but everyone you know, is trying to smooth it over
find a way to make the hurt go away
but everyone you know, is trying to smooth it over
like you're trying to scream underwater

but, i won't let you make the great escape
i'm never gonna watch you checking out of this place
i'm not gonna lose you
cause the passion and the pain
are gonna keep you alive someday
gonna keep you alive someday

i feel like i could wave my fist in front of your face
and you wouldn't flinch or even feel a thing
and you've retreated to your silent corner
like you decided the fight was over for ya

but everyone you know, is trying to smooth it over
find a way to make the hurt go away
but everyone you know, is trying to smooth it over
everyone needs a floor they can fall through

but, i won't let you make the great escape
i'm never gonna watch you checking out of this place
i'm not gonna lose you
cause the passion and the pain
are gonna keep you alive someday

oh, terrified of the dark, but not if you go with me

you're not gonna watch me checking out of this place
you're not gonna lose me
cause the passion and pain
are gonna keep us alive, someday
yeah the passion and the pain
are gonna keep us alive someday, someday


if there's one thing that i'm sure about
it's that i got a lot to learn
if there's another thing that i'm sure about
it's that i'm sick of sitting, waitin' my turn
i've been knocked around, pushed to the ground
people try to hold me down
but here's a little thing that i'm sure about
i'm gon' be standin' firm
when i get back up again

i count on me
when everybody's counting me out
i count on me
when the world is full of doubt
through the storm, through the pain
through the fire and through the rain
i count on me
and that's the way it's gonna be

when i look around, all that i can see
is people trying to shift the blame
when i look around, yeah, it's clear to me
somethin' 'bout me ain't the same
some people are cold, selling their soul
i don't wanna be that way
take a look around, take a look at me
i ain't never gonna change
'cause i know what i believe

i count on me
when everybody's counting me out
i count on me
when the world is full of doubt
through the storm, through the pain
through the fire and through the rain
i count on me
and that's the way it's gonna be

now i ain't sayin' i can't rely on no one else
'cause there are days when i'm tryin' to find a little help
my friends got good intentions and though they mean well
don't nobody know me, like i know i know myself

i count on me
when everybody's counting me out
i count on me
when the world is full of doubt
through the storm, through the pain
through the fire and through the rain
i count on me
and that's the way it's gotta be

i count on me
when there's no one to turn to, nowhere to go
i count on me
when i'm tryin' to find a helping hand, they have me know
i count on me
through the fire, through the rain, through the snow
i count on me
that's the way it's gonna be


i'm home alone again
and you're out, hanging with your friends
so you say, somehow i know its not quite that way
it's getting pretty late, and you haven't checked on me all day
when i called, you didn't answer
now i'm feeling like you're ignoring me
i wish,that you were home, holding me tight in your arms
i wish,i could go back, to the day before we met and skip my regret

i wish i wasn't in love with you
so you couldn't hurt me
it just ain't fair the way you treat me
no you don't deserve me
wasted my time thinking bout you and you ain't never gone change
i wish i wasn't in love with you so i wouldn't feel this way

when you touch me my heart melts
and everything you did wrong i forget
so you play me and take advantage of the love that i feel for you
why you wanna hurt me so bad
i believed in you that's why i'm so mad
now i'm drowning in disappointment, and it's hard for me to even look at you
i wish, that you were home, holding me tight in your arms. oooh baby
i wish, i could go back
to the day before we met and skip my regret


said you care about me, but from what i see
i ain't feeling all that, so i disagree
gave you all my love and understanding
yet you treated me like your enemy
so leave me alone, don't want nothin' from you
just go back where you came from
this house is no longer your home
you're not welcome no, no, no,more


hear you knockin' at the door again
i'm wonderin' should i let you in
i open up the door and see
the flowers for me
so
beautiful in your hand
please stop begging me to take you back
i've always been a sucker for romance
and before you know
it i concede
you're all over me
oh no here i go again
i wish i wasn't in love with you
so you couldn't hurt me


oh, here it goes

i feel like fire, i feel like rain
i can take you higher, but you gotta earn it

woo, i'm lit, don't mess with it
woo, stand back, let me do my shit
woo, i'm lit, don't mess with it, woo

hands to the sky, show me that you're mine
hands to the sky, show me that you're mine
and baby, worship me

on your knees
patiently, quietly, faithfully, worship me

feel that lightning down in my soul
and if you wanna feel the thunder, baby

i would say can you see my angles
'cause i'm hotter than the, i'm hotter than the stovetop
you can put your kettle on, but i'ma make the thing pop
no, i ain't talkin' 'bout my word, just my work
you can add it all up while i'm beefin' up my purse

 oh, yeah 
and baby, worship me  worship me

on your knees

oh, i'm a mess right now, inside out
searching for a sweet surrender but this is not the end
i can't work it out, how
going through the motions, going through us

and oh, i've known it for the longest time
and all of my hopes, all of my words
are all over written on the signs
when you're on my road walking me home
home, home, home, home

see the flames inside my eyes
it burns so bright i wanna feel your love, no
easy baby, maybe i'm a liar
but for tonight i wanna fall in love
put your faith in my stomach

i messed up this time, late last night
drinking to suppress devotion, with fingers intertwined
i can't shake this feeling, now
we're going through the motions, hoping you'd stop

and oh, i've only caused you pain, you know
that all of my words will always be low
of all the love we spoke
when you're on my road walking me home
home, home, home, home

see the flames inside my eyes
it burns so bright i wanna feel your love, no
easy baby, maybe i'm a liar
but for tonight i wanna fall in love
put your faith in my stomach

i'll probably always have these ugly scars
but right now, i don't care about that part
i bust the windows out your car
after i saw you laying next to her
i didn't wanna, but i took my turn
i'm glad i did it cause you had to learn
i must admit it helped a little bit
to think of how you'd feel when you saw it
i didn't know that i had that much strength
but i'm glad you see what happens when

you see you can't just play with people's feelings
tell them you love them and don't mean it
you'll probably say that it was juvenile
but i think that i deserve to smile
i bust the windows out your car
you know i did it cause i left my mark
wrote my initials with a crowbar
and then i drove off into the dark
i bust the windows out your car
you should feel lucky that was all i did
after 5 whole years of this bullshit
gave you all of me and you played with it
i must admit it helped a little bit
to think of how you'd feel when you saw it
i didn't know that i had that much strength
but i'm glad you see what happens when
you see you can't just play with people's feelings
tell them you love them and don't mean it
you probably say that it was juvenile
but i think that i deserve to smile
i bust the windows out your car
but it don't compare to my broken heart
you could never feel how i felt that day
until it happens, baby, you don't know pain
oh, yeah, i did it. you should know it
i ain't sorry. you deserved it
after what you did to me
you deserved it. i ain't sorry no, no
you broke my heart, so i broke your car
you caused me pain, so i did the same
even though what you did to me was much worse
i had to do something to make you hurt
oh, but why am i still crying?
why am i the one who's still crying?
oh, oh, you really hurt me, baby
you really, really hurt me, baby
hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

i could have beer for breakfast
my sanity for lunch
trying to get over how bad i want you so much
innocence for dinner
pour something in my cup
anything and everything just to fill me up

but nothing ever gets me high like this
i pick my poison and it's you
nothing could kill me like you do
you're going straight to my head
and i'm heading straight for the edge
i pick my poison and it's you
i pick my poison and it's you

i can feel your whisper
and laying on the floor
and i try to stop but i keep on coming back for more
i'm a lightweight, and i know it
'cause after the first time
i was falling
falling down

but nothing ever gets me high like this
i pick my poison and it's you
nothing could kill me like you do
you're going straight to my head
and i'm heading straight for the edge
i pick my poison and it's you
i pick my poison and it's you

bittersweet ecstasy that you got me in
falling deep i can't sleep tonight
and you make me feel like i'm out of my mind
but it's alright, it's alright, it's alright
bittersweet ecstasy that you got me in
falling deep i can't sleep tonight
and you make me feel like i'm out of my mind
ohh, but it's alright, it's alright, it's alright

nothing ever gets me high like this

i will have to die for this, i fear
there's rage and terror and there's sickness here
i fight because i have to
i fight for us to know the truth

there's not enough rope to tie me down
there's not enough tape to shut this mouth
the stones you throw can make me bleed
but i won't stop until we're free
wild hearts can't be broken
no, wild hearts can't be broken

this is my rally cry
i know it's hard, we have to try
this is a battle i must win
to want my share is not a sin

there's not enough rope to tie me down
there's not enough tape to shut this mouth
the stones you throw can make me bleed
but i won't stop until we're free
and wild hearts can't be broken
no, wild hearts can't be broken

you beat me, betray me
you're losing, we're winning
my spirit above me
you cannot deny me
my freedom is burning
this broken world keeps turning
i'll never surrender
there's nothing, but a victory

there's not enough rope to tie me down, oh
there's not enough tape to shut this mouth
the stones you throw can make me bleed
but i won't stop until we're free
wild hearts can't be broken
wild hearts can't be broken
this wild heart can't be broken


"boogie down was performing, hey they ain't no joke"
"down with the sound called b d p"

back in the days i knew rap would never die
i used to listen to awesome 2 on whbi
i used to hear all kind of rap groups before sampling loops
rappers wore bell bottom lee suits
me and kenny couldn't afford that
so we would go to the park when they was jammin' to hear rap
i used to listen till the cops broke it up
i always thought to myself "damn, why they fucked it up?"
but nevertheless i was in love with the microphone
and it stayed that way until i left home
on the streets of new york, now i'm free
but with freedom comes big responsibility
i used to walk around driven by the force
i remember how large super rhymes was when he fell off
i used to wonder about crews that used to rock
they were large, but none of them could manage to stay on top

do you ever think about when you outta here?
record deal and video outta here?
mercedes benz and range rover outta here?
no doubt bdp is old school, but we ain't goin' out 

after livin' on the streets alone
some years went by, i signed myself into a group home
i used to watch the show "i dream of jeannie"
and dreamt about "when will i be large like whodini?"
but i was messin' with graffiti on the subway
and gettin' chased by the cops almost everyday
i knew it had to bea better way see
so i would go to my room, blast run dmc
around 1984 i left the group home, again alone
still dreamin' about the microphone
gimme a chance man, i know i can rock it
but i had to worry about puttin' money in my pocket
so when i reached the shelter i met my helper dj scott la rock
and we both loved hip hop
i was takin' suckas out in the shelter system
yeah there was rappers in the shelter but i had to diss 'em
but all along, my vision was never lost
i kept seeing all these rap groups fallin' off

do you ever think about when you're outta here?
fly girl and fresh gear outta here?
five thousand dollar love seat outta here?
no doubt bdp is old school, but we ain't goin' out 

while i'm battling these rival crews
yes, bdp would stay in the street news
some said, all they wanna do is battle
they can't write a song, so their careers won't last long 
around this time i used to hang with ced gee
and dj scott la rock used to buy gold with eric b
i didn't meet rakim till later with scott
i remember we were jammin' at the rooftop
it used to irk me when these critics had opinions
scott would say "just keep rappin', i'll keep spinnin'"
we had a fucked up contract, but we signed it
and dropped the hip hop album criminal minded
we told the critics your opinions are bull
same time eric b and rakim dropped paid in full
hip hop pioneers we didn't ask to be
but right then hip hop changed drastically
people didn't wanna hear the old rap sound
we started samplin' beats by james brown
in the middle of doin' "my philosophy"
scott was killed and that shit got to me
but knowin' the laws of life and death
i knew his breath, was one with my breath
i had nothin' left and it was scary
so i dropped by all means necessary
another hip hop group that was a friend of me
was a revolution crew called public enemy
it takes a nation of millions to hold us back
these two albums set off consciousness in rap
but all along, i'm still lookin' around
and all i can see are these rap groups fallin' down

do you ever think about when you outta here?
condominium and beach house outta here?
credit cards and bank accounts outta here?
no doubt bdp is old school, be we ain't goin' out 


don't, don't play with her, don't be dishonest  ayy 
still not understandin' this logic  ayy 
i'm back and i'm better  and i'm better 
i want you bad as ever
don't let me just let up
i wanna give you better
baby, it's whatever
somebody gotta step up
girl, i'm that somebody, so i'm next up
be damned if i let him catch up
it's easy to see that you're fed up
i am on a whole 'nother level
girl, he only fucked you over cause you let him
fuck him, girl, i guess he didn't know any better
girl, that man didn't show any effort
do all i can just to show you you're special
certain it's your love that holds me together
lately you say he been killin' the vibe
gotta be sick of this guy
pull up, skrr, get in the ride
left hand is steerin' the other is grippin' your thigh
light up a spliff and get high
shawty, you deserve what you've been missin'
lookin' at you i'm thinkin' he must be trippin'
play this song for him, tell him, "just listen"

don't
don't

girl, said he keeps on playin' games
and his lovin' ain't the same
i don't know what to say, but
what a shame
if you were mine you would not get the same
if you were mine you would top everything
suicide in the drop switchin' lanes
and that thing so fire, baby, no propane
got good pussy, girl, can i be frank?
to keep it one hundred, girl, i ain't no saint
but he the only reason that i'm feelin' this way
givin' you the world, baby, when you get space
pen game get me laid, baby, that's penetrate
oh baby

don't

h town got a nigga so throwed
pour up, we can party some more
yeah, got this drank in my cup
got a young nigga feelin' so throwed
spit fire in a world so cold

i can't believe you had the nerve to say the things you said
they hurt so bad that they ended our relationship
i can't believe it, four years go down the drain
oh, how i wish things would have happened so differently
i tried to save us so many times, but still you couldn't see
you kept insistin' and resistin' that you would not fall again

and now you're tryna tell me that you're sorry
and you're tryna come back home
you're tellin' me you really need me crying
beggin' both knees are on the floor
but baby, i

don't wanna try, don't wanna try, don't wanna try no more
you keep insisting when you know our love is out the door
don't wanna try, don't wanna try 'cause all we do is fight
and say the things that hurt too bad to where we both begin to cry
don't wanna try, don't wanna try, i've about just had enough
it's been a rough road, baby, just let it go
don't wanna try, don't wanna try, don't wanna try no more
tell me what's the use of holdin' on when all we do is hurt our love

you and i had many conversations on the telephone
talks about one day we having a place of our own
wake up in the morning and have breakfast ready on the table
but all of that just seems so far away from me
had to wake up, face reality
it all just seem too good to be true after all you put me through

and now you're tryna tell me that you're sorry
and you're tryna come back home
you're tellin' me you really need me crying
beggin' both knees are on the floor
but baby, i

don't wanna try, don't wanna try, don't wanna try no more
you keep insisting when you know our love is out the door
don't wanna try, don't wanna try 'cause all we do is fight
and say the things that hurt too bad to where we both begin to cry
don't wanna try, don't wanna try, i've about just had enough
it's been a rough road, baby, just let it go
don't wanna try, don't wanna try, don't wanna try no more
tell me what's the use of holdin' on when all we do is hurt our love


don't wanna try, don't wanna try
don't wanna try no more
don't wanna try, don't wanna try, oh
don't wanna try, don't wanna try
don't wanna try no more
don't wanna try, don't wanna try, don't wanna try no more

you can, you can, take take time, you can, you can
walk, run, dive, close call
think you might fall, but all you gotta do is try
even angels, even angels learn to fly

coming home in this late night
shoulda left the lights on  on 
i can't help but image all the things
that could go wrong, i'm  on my own 
i'm in the kitchen
on the chair, reaching for the top shelf, i'm  all alone 
and i'm okay, i'm alright

grew up in a small town
and when the rain would fall down
i'd just stare out my window
dreaming of what could be
and if i'd end up happy
i would pray  i would pray 

trying hard to reach out
but when i tried to speak out
felt like no one could hear me
wanted to belong here
but something felt so wrong here
so i prayed  i would pray  i could break away

i'll spread my wings and i'll learn how to fly
i'll do what it takes 'til i touch the sky
and i'll make a wish
take a chance
make a change
and breakaway
out of the darkness and into the sun
but i won't forget all the ones that i love
i'll take a risk
take a chance
make a change
and breakaway

wanna feel the warm breeze
sleep under a palm tree
feel the rush of the ocean
get onboard a fast train
travel on a jet plane, far away  i will 
and breakaway

i'll spread my wings and i'll learn how to fly
i'll do what it takes 'til i touch the sky
and i'll make a wish
take a chance
make a change
and breakaway
out of the darkness and into the sun
i won't forget all the ones that i love  i gotta 
i'll take a risk
take a chance
make a change
and breakaway

buildings with a hundred floors
swinging around revolving doors
maybe i don't know where they'll take me but
gotta keep moving on, moving on
fly away, breakaway

i'll spread my wings
and i'll learn how to fly  learn how to fly 
though it's not easy to tell you goodbye
i gotta take a risk
take a chance
make a change
and breakaway
out of the darkness and into the sun
but i won't forget the place i come from
i gotta take a risk

make a change
and breakaway

all of the greatest

we're chasing their fading star

if i were a boy
even just for a day
i'd roll out of bed in the morning
and throw on what i wanted and go
drink beer with the guys
and chase after girls
i'd kick it with who i wanted
and i'd never get confronted for it
'cause they'd stick up for me

if i were a boy
i think i could understand
how it feels to love a girl
i swear i'd be a better man
i'd listen to her
'cause i know how it hurts
when you lose the one you wanted
'cause he's taken you for granted
and everything you had got destroyed

if i were a boy
i would turn off my phone
tell everyone it's broken
so they'd think that i was sleepin' alone
i'd put myself first
and make the rules as i go
'cause i'd know that she'd be faithful
waitin' for me to come home
to come home

if i were a boy
i think i could understand
how it feels to love a girl
i swear i'd be a better man
i'd listen to her
'cause i know how it hurts
when you lose the one you wanted  wanted 
'cause he's taken you for granted  granted 
and everything you had got destroyed

it's a little too late for you to come back
say, it's just a mistake
think i'd forgive you like that
if you thought i would wait for you
you thought wrong

but you're just a boy
you don't understand
 yeah, you don't understand, oh 
how it feels to love a girl
someday, you'll wish you were a better man
you don't listen to her
you don't care how it hurts
until you lose the one you wanted
'cause you've taken her for granted
and everything you have got destroyed
but you're just a boy...

will you wake from worldly dreams and not be tired?
will you work like me to lift the conversation higher?
will you be cool like water putting out the fire?
how can you be free from all this sorrow?
will the ones you love today be gone tomorrow?

and if angels don't have answers to your prayers
oh, i will be there, oh i will be there

and if who you love don't want your love, well then...
do you cut a deal with love and run again?
you see, love contains the meaning of despair
will you think like me? will you  have your mother's fire?
maybe the way we are will not be how you're wired
will we do right by you? will you have what you require?
to make your days on this earth be not so dire?

can you choose to lead if no one follows?
and if we fell today, must you tomorrow?
sanctify your answer not your prayer
oh, i will be there, yeah, i will be there
yeah, i will be there

and even when it all becomes too much
when you're growing old and feeling out of touch
listen to this song and just take care
and know that i will be there, yeah, i will be there
no, i swear that i will, yeah, i promise i will

leave your house of mirrors, hear me out
fear no consequence, forget your doubts

i don't know where the road leads
you don't know if i'll break your heart
we don't know how the winds will blow
and we won't know
we won't go unless we start
ooh, ooh, start

fall into the sea of possibility
and hope

this is a story about a girl named lucky

early morning, she wakes up
knock, knock, knock on the door
it's time for makeup, perfect smile
it's you they're all waiting for

they go, "isn't she lovely, this hollywood girl?"
and they say

"she's so lucky, she's a star
but she cry, cry, cries in her lonely heart, thinking
if there's nothing missing in my life
then why do these tears come at night?"

lost in an image, in a dream
but there's no one there to wake her up
and the world is spinning, and she keeps on winning
but tell me, what happens when it stops?

they go, "isn't she lovely, this hollywood girl?"
and they say

"she's so lucky, she's a star
but she cry, cry, cries in her lonely heart, thinking
if there's nothing missing in my life
then why do these tears come at night?"

"best actress, and the winner is, lucky "
"i'm roger johnson for pop news, standing outside the arena waiting for lucky"
"oh my god, here she comes "

isn't she lovely, this hollywood girl?
she is so lucky, but why does she cry?
if there is nothing missing in her life
why do tears come at night?
and they say

you're a holiday
a glass of ocean slipping down my throat
and landing on my hopes, i'm dreaming
off the maps, no hidden grids, i'm fleeing
i worship you like holy days
lying on my back, seeing clouds and rays
drinking lime and bitter from my lemonade
white horses, maritime won't do

do you remember?
the holiday slipped away
time and place
i definitely remember
lying on my back and seeing clouds and rays

dreaming of a past that couldn't last

refraining

i'm thinkin it's the bad, bad blood
i'm thinkin it's the, know that it's the
i'm thinkin it's the bad, bad blood

do you remember?
the riding, the passion, the falling over
and tripping on ice
sharing advice, taking it twice
but let us not forget the
silent days, stripped away
time and place
oh, you choose not to remember
fly away and counting days
i'm hiding from you, ooh

i'm thinkin it's the, know that it's the
i'm thinkin it's the bad, bad blood
i'm thinkin it's the, know that it's the
i'm thinkin it's the bad, bad blood

i choose
for the rain not to fall
exposing the soil on you
i lose
don't tell me i'm cuckoo, i know
and it's mad, we were close, oh
i choose
my head's now afloat
but my heart's drowning boats of you
i lose
don't tell me i'm coo coo
coo coo coo coo coo coo ooh ooh

i'm thinkin it is the bad, bad blood

waste all your time writing love songs, but you don't love me
all too familiar when it feels wrong
i think you're just lonely
do you mind?
i found another new way to look at
use your time to pack away your every verse and every rhyme
forget, all the words that let you break my heart
forget, that i'm the person tearing you apart 
remember way back when you played me
i lost that hand
so please don't try serenade me
i am a one man band
say goodbye
don't need to hear you play
so many other ways to relax
so pack away your every verse and every rhyme
forget, all the words that let you break my heart 
forget, that i'm the person tearing you apart 
i think it's time for me to leave
i gave this piece of mind for free
so if you hear my sound advice, there is no need to tell you twice
there is no need to tell you twice 
forget, all the words that let you break my heart 
forget, that i'm the person tearing you apart 
so if you hear my sound advice, there is no need to tell you twice

i'll be right beside you, dear
louder louder, and we'll run for our lives
i can hardly speak, i understand
why you can't raise your voice to say

i nearly do

light up, light up, as if you have a choice
even if you cannot hear my voice
i'll be right beside you, dear
louder louder, and we'll run for our lives

you broke me
and taught me
to truly hate myself
unfold me
and teach me
how to be like somebody else
when i felt strong enough
i was discovered by the love
i had been waiting for so long
you told me none of that was real
i cannot hide how low i feel
to know that you were never wrong
you broke me
and taught me
to truly hate myself
unfold me
and teach me
how to be like somebody else
you're lost and found
fallen out
broken down
you broke me
and taught me
to truly hate myself
unfold me
and teach me
how to be like somebody else
how to be like somebody else

you took my heart and you held it in your mouth
and with a word all my love came rushing out
and every whisper, it's the worst
emptied out by a single word
there is a hollow in me now
so i put my faith in something unknown
i'm living on such sweet nothing
but i'm tired of hope with nothing to hope
i'm living on such sweet nothing
and it's hard to learn
and it's hard to love
when you're giving me such sweet nothing
sweet nothing, sweet nothing
you're giving me such sweet nothing
it isn't easy for me to let it go
because i've swallowed every single word
and every whisper, every sigh
eats away this heart of mine
and there is a hollow in me now
so i put my faith in something unknown
i'm living on such sweet nothing
but i'm tired of hope with nothing to hope
i'm living on such sweet nothing
and it's hard to learn
and it's hard to love
when you're giving me such sweet nothing
sweet nothing, sweet nothing
you're giving me such sweet nothing
and it's not enough to tell me that you care
when we both know the words are empty air
you give me nothing
you give me nothing, nothing
so i put my faith in something unknown
i'm living on such sweet nothing
but i'm tired of hope with nothing to hope
i'm living on such sweet nothing
but it's hard to learn
and it's hard to love
when you're giving me such sweet nothing
sweet nothing, sweet nothing
when you're giving me such sweet nothing

wake you up like sunrise, on the backs of your thighs
i'm gonna pray you this prayer
that i keep in my mind, as a lovely reminder

even though you tell me you love me
i'm afraid that you just love my disguise
taste my fears and light your candle to my raging fire
of broken desire

but don't judge me
i know i got issues, but they drown when i kiss you
don't judge me
baptize me with ocean, recognize my devotion

if i'm gon' sin, it's with you
tattoo your love on my heart, let the rumors be true

taste my fears and light your candle to my raging fire
the dirty desire

but don't judge me

don't, don't judge me
baptize me with ocean, recognize my devotion

is it me or do you love my disguise?
if i kissed you, would you think i was lonely
if i let you inside?

so unhappy

i can't stand by the side
ooh, no
and watch this life pass me by

sometimes a mystery, sometimes i'm free
depending on my mood or my attitude
sometimes i wanna roll or stay at home
walking contradiction, guess i m factual and fiction

a little crazy, little sexy, little cool
little rough around the edges but i keep it smooth
i m always left of center and that s right where i belong
i m the random minor note you hear in major songs

and i like that
i don t really give a fuck if i was just the only one

oh me, oh me, oh me, oh my
oh me, oh me, oh me, oh my
i like that

i don t care what i look like, but i feel good
better than amazing, and better than i could
told the whole world, i m the venom and the antidote
take a different type of girl to keep the whole world afloat

'cause i m crazy and i m sexy then i m cool
little rough around the edges but i keep it smooth
i m always left of center and that s right where i belong

so if the role, so if the role don't fit me
got to be moving on

i could be a typical kinda girl
wasting my time
that ain't my style
see i would rather be occupied
always tryna keep my mind
pointing to a higher place
i can have anything i want
anything i can dream of
i've been told from the day i was born
so i make sure everyday
that i don't let nothing hold me back
got to be on track
i gotta move

so if the role don't fit me
got to be moving on
cause if it don't work for me
guess i'll be moving on

hey i could take liberty
but that would cause me a change
and that ain't my thang
cause i don't wanna stand with the crowd
only true to myself
don't have a follow to no one else
not trying to be alone
but if the fact doing wrong
got no problem leaving the room
don't feel no sympathy
at least not for me
cause i know just what i am gonna do
i gotta move
 2x 
so if the role don't fit me
got to be moving on
cause if it don't work for me
guess i'll be moving on
keep moving  7x 
on   on and on
 2x 
keep moving
keep moving
keep moving
on   on

so if the role don't fit me
got to be moving on
cause if it don't work for me
guess i'll be moving on

keep moving
keep moving
keep moving
on   on

i know that when you look at me
there's so much that you just don't see
but if you would only take the time
i know in my heart you'd find

oh, a girl who's scared sometimes
who isn't always strong
can't you see the hurt in me?
i feel so all alone

i want to run to you, you
i want to run to you
won't you hold me in your arms and keep me safe from harm?
i want to run to you
but if i come to you
tell me, will you stay, will you run away?

y'all, each day, each day i play the role
of someone always in control
lord you know at night when i come home and turn the key
there's nobody there for me, no one cares for me

oh what's the sense of trying hard to find your dreams
without someone to share it with
tell me what does it all really mean?

i want to run to you, you
i want to run to you, you
won't you hold me in your arms and keep me safe from harm?
i want to run to you, you
but if i come to you, you
tell me, will you stay, or will you run away?
run away, oh

i need you here
i need you here to wipe away my tears
to kiss away my fears
if you only knew how much  if you only knew, how much i wanna run 

i want to run to you, you
i want to run to you, you
see, won't you hold me in your arms and keep me safe from harm?
see, i want to run to you, you, you, you
but if i come to you
tell me, will you stay, will you run away?
away...


each day i live
i want to be
a day to give
the best of me
i'm only one
but not alone
my finest day
is yet unknown
i broke my heart
fought every gain
to taste the sweet
i face the pain
i rise and fall
yet through it all
this much remains

i want one moment in time
when i'm more than i thought i could be
when all of my dreams are a heartbeat away
and the answers are all up to me
give me one moment in time
when i'm racing with destiny
then in that one moment of time
i will feel
i will feel eternity

i've lived to be
the very best
i want it all
no time for less
i've laid the plans
now lay the chance
here in my hands


you're a winner for a lifetime
if you seize that one moment in time
make it shine


i will be
i will be free
i will be
i will be free


i used to cry myself to sleep at night
but that was all before he came
i thought love had to hurt to turn out right
but now he's here
it's not the same, it's not the same

he fills me up
he gives me love
more love than i've ever seen
he's all i've got
he's all i've got in this world
but he's all the man that i need

and in the morning when i kiss his eyes
he takes me down and rocks me slow
and in the evening
when the moon is high
he holds me close and won't let go
he won't let go

he fills me up
he gives me love
more love than i've ever seen
he's all i've got
he's all i've got in this world
but he's all the man that i need
he fills me up
he gives me love
more love than i've ever seen
he's all i've got
he's all i've got in this world
but he's all the man that i need
he fills me up
he gives me love
more love than i've ever seen
he's all i've got
he's all i've got in this world
but he's all the man that i need

i would really take you back
let you back in my heart one more time
ohh. no. no
did you think that i'd still care
that there'd be more feeling there
did you think you could walk back in my life
so you found you miss the love you threw away
baby but you found it out too late. too late

and so you know the way it feels to cry
the way that i cried when you broke my world in two
baby i learned the way to break a heart
i learned from the best
i learned from you  oh baby now 
i learned from you

i remember cold nights
tears i though would never dry
how you shattered my world
with your goodbye.your goodbye baby
would've sold my soul then
just to have you back again
now you're the last thing on my mind
now you say you're sorry and
you've changed your ways
sorry but you changed your ways too late

i think of what the world could be
a vision of the one i see
a million dreams is all it's gonna take
oh, a million dreams for the world we're gonna make

you weren't the boy i thought i knew
maybe i was blind, i was young, i didn't have a clue
you were the topic of my lunch times
i'd bore the girls about our chats
and get upset when you didn't text back
i was warned by my brothers to find another lover
stop falling for these boys who didn't want the same as me
and i was warned by my brothers to find another lover

we all want a teenage fantasy
want it when we can't have it
when we got it we don't seem to want it

i've got a lot of things to do
what if i had been a fool and thought i was in love with you
i need to grow and find myself before i let somebody love me
because at the moment i don't know me
when i was told by my father, if i look into the future
do i really see this boy, that i think i've fallen for?
and i was told by my mother, if i look into the future
do i really see this boy, that i think i've fallen for?

we all want a teenage fantasy
want it when we can't have it
when we got it we don't seem to want it, no
we all want a teenage fantasy
want it when we can't have it
when we got it we don't seem to want it

when we are young, we all want someone
who we think is the one, just to fit in
there's no need to rush, take your time
life's a big old ride, sit back and enjoy the vibe

if i were a boy
even just for a day
i'd roll out of bed in the morning
and throw on what i wanted and go
drink beer with the guys
and chase after girls
i'd kick it with who i wanted
and i'd never get confronted for it
'cause they'd stick up for me

if i were a boy
i think i could understand
how it feels to love a girl
i swear i'd be a better man
i'd listen to her
'cause i know how it hurts
when you lose the one you wanted
'cause he's taken you for granted
and everything you had got destroyed

if i were a boy
i would turn off my phone
tell everyone it's broken
so they'd think that i was sleepin' alone
i'd put myself first
and make the rules as i go
'cause i'd know that she'd be faithful
waitin' for me to come home
to come home

if i were a boy
i think i could understand
how it feels to love a girl
i swear i'd be a better man
i'd listen to her
'cause i know how it hurts
when you lose the one you wanted  wanted 
'cause he's taken you for granted  granted 
and everything you had got destroyed

it's a little too late for you to come back
say, it's just a mistake
think i'd forgive you like that
if you thought i would wait for you
you thought wrong

but you're just a boy
you don't understand
 yeah, you don't understand, oh 
how it feels to love a girl
someday, you'll wish you were a better man
you don't listen to her
you don't care how it hurts
until you lose the one you wanted
'cause you've taken her for granted
and everything you have got destroyed
but you're just a boy...


whatever you want
whatever you need
anything you want done baby
i do it naturally
cause i'm every woman  every woman 
it's all in me
it's all in me
yeah

i'm every woman
it's all in me
anything you want done baby
i do it naturally

i'm every woman
it's all in me
i can read your thoughts right now
every one, from a to z
whoa whoa whoa
whoa  oh  whoa  oh  whoa

i can cast a spell
see, but you can't tell
mix a special groove
put fire inside of you
anytime you feel danger or fear
then instantly
i will appear
yeah oh

i'm every woman
it's all in me
anything you want done baby
i do it naturally
whoa whoa whoa
whoa whoa whoa

oh, i can sense your needs
like rain onto the seeds
i can make a rhyme of confusion in your mind
and when it comes down to some good old fashioned love
i got it, i got it
i got it, got it, baby baby

i'm every woman
it's all in me
i can read your thoughts right now
every one, from a to z
whoa whoa whoa
whoa whoa whoa

i ain't bragging
because i'm the one
just ask me
oh, it shall be done
and don't bother
to compare
i've got it


there's a life outside i didn't know
tied up, falling down to an empty soul
and lord knows that this love has taken toll
i've given all of my love to this broken home

so why don't you lose yourself for me?
why don't you lose yourself for me?
what is it that your eyes don't see?
why don't you lose yourself for me?

it won't work if it don't make sense at all
i'm so lost that i can't see through the fold
the same stains that were left from the cherry wine
the same stains that i wish we could both rewind

did you notice that the feeling ain't never gone?
did you notice it's the feeling you've been running from?
you wouldn't notice if your eyes ain't falling for me?
did you open up my heart, just to take it from me?

so why don't you lose yourself for me?
so why don't you lose yourself for me?
what is it that your eyes don't see?
why don't you lose yourself for me?
why don't you lose yourself for me?
why don't you lose yourself for me?

lose yourself from playing games
lose yourself, it ain't the same
lose yourself from playing games
lose yourself from playing games
lose yourself from playing games
lose yourself from playing games
lose, lose
lose yourself from playing games
lose yourself from playing games
lose, lose

when sometimes you could be lost, you could be found
i've been lost, i've been lost again and i've been found
then i found myself but i'm constantly finding myself

i can't remember why i'm feeling this way
i guess i should be crying but my heart just won't obey
it feels strange to be happy as i lie here on the rooftop in the rain
i say

amen
to all the crazy things that happened that made me who i am
i say amen
to everyone who ever hurt me
i'm stronger 'cause of them
amen

i'm not worrying 'bout tomorrow
i'm forgetting yesterday
just savouring the moment in this unfamiliar place
and i'm feeling like the velvet in a beat up guitar case
and so, i'll say

i say amen
to all the crazy things that happened that made me who i am
i say amen
to everyone who ever hurt me
i'm stronger 'cause of them
amen

oh, life is so bizzare
why do we have to be so hard on ourselves?
i think i found a way to smile and be ok with myself
with myself

amen
to all the crazy things that happened that made me who i am
amen
to everyone who ever hurt me
i'm stronger 'cause of them
and i might have not the answers, but the questions make more sense
amen


how does one attempt to be
the kind of friend that you would want to keep?
i just want to say to thee
even though it might be hard to believe
the candy coated thoughts that drift through my sleep
lets me know it's you that holds the key
i got a craving for confection so sweet
for the taste of when our lips first meet

oh, in another life, i bet you wouldn't know that
oh, in another life, i bet you were my girl

i just wanna take you with me
to secret rooms in the mansions of my mind
shower you with all that you need
take my hand, i swear i'll take my time
i'm not surprised to find that angels compete
for the chance to lay down at your feet
i'm gonna touch in all of the places that please
pull you close
i wanna feel you breathe

oh, in another life, i bet you wouldn't know that
oh, in another life, i bet you were my girl
it's another reason for the season
i don't wanna break your heart
oh, in another life, i bet you were my girl, oh 
in another life, i bet you wouldn't know that
in another life, i bet you were my girl
oh, in another life, i bet you wouldn't know that


touch me when you feel that ember light
candle wax dripping 'til we re color blind

finger tips to trace my lips

i will not let myself cause my heart so much misery
i will not break the way you did, you fell so hard
i've learned the hard way to never let it get that far

because of you
i never stray too far from the sidewalk
because of you
i learned to play on the safe side so i don't get hurt
because of you
i find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me
because of you, i am afraid

i lose my way
and it's not too long before you point it out
i cannot cry
because i know that's weakness in your eyes
i'm forced to fake a smile, a laugh, every day of my life
my heart can't possibly break
when it wasn't even whole to start with

because of you
i never stray too far from the sidewalk
because of you
i learned to play on the safe side so i don't get hurt
because of you
i find it hard to trust
not only me, but everyone around me
because of you
i am afraid

i watched you die, i heard you cry every night in your sleep
i was so young, you should have known better than to lean on me
you never thought of anyone else, you just saw your pain
and now i cry in the middle of the night
for the same damn thing

because of you
i never stray too far from the sidewalk
because of you
i learned to play on the safe side so i don't get hurt
because of you
i try my hardest just to forget everything
because of you
i don't know how to let anyone else in
because of you
i'm ashamed of my life because it's empty
because of you
i am afraid

because of you
because of you


wait for it, wait for it
wait for it, wait for it
wait for it, wait for it

i saved every letter you wrote me
from the moment i read them
i knew you were mine, said you were mine
i thought you were mine
do you know what angelica said
when we saw your first letter arrive?
she said,  be careful with that one, love
he will do what it takes to survive. 

you and your words flooded my senses
your sentences left me defenseless
you built me palaces out of paragraphs
you built cathedrals

i m re reading the letters you wrote me
searching and scanning for answers
in every line, for some kind of sign
and when you were mine
the world seemed to

burn
burn

you published the letters she wrote you
you told the whole world how you brought
this girl into our bed
in clearing your name, you have ruined our lives
do you know what angelica said
when she read what you d done?
she said,  you have married an icarus
he has flown too close to the sun. 

you and your words, obsessed with your legacy
your sentences border on senseless
and you are paranoid in every paragraph
how they perceive you
you, you, you 

i m erasing myself from this narrative
let future historians wonder how eliza
reacted when you broke her heart
you have torn it all apart
i am watching it

burn
watching it burn

the world has no right to my heart
the world has no place in our bed
they don t get to know what i said
i m burning the memories
burning the letters that might have redeemed you
you forfeit all rights to my heart
you forfeit the place in our bed
you sleep in your office instead
with only the memories
of when you were mine

i hope that you burn

sometimes i wonder what is the meaning of this life
i found the price of love and lost my mind
i will forgive them all of my wrongs and my rights
i'd do it all again and won't think twice, won't think twice

are you devil? are you angel?
am i heaven? am i hell?
i can barely find the proof to save myself
are you water? are you fire?
are you filthy? are you pure?
oh, i thought by now i'd know
but i'm not sure

well, you're no angel
i never asked you to be
you're my danger 'cause that's just what i need
but it still hurts me

well, sometimes i wonder what is the meaning of my life
i found the price of love and lost my mind
i will forgive them all of my wrongs and my rights
i'd do it all again and won't think twice
won't think twice

my forever and my end
my forgiveness and my sin
i have sacrificed the most of my youth
is it treason? is it true?
that the worst i won't undo
only enemy i have in love is you

well, you're no angel
i never asked you to be
you're my danger 'cause that's just what i need
but it still hurts me

well, sometimes i wonder what is the meaning of my life
i found the price of love and lost my mind
oh, i will forgive them all of my wrongs and my rights
i'd do it all again and won't think twice, no
won't think twice

were you devil? were you angel?
it's too late to change my mind
i would do it all again and not think twice

you're a holiday
a glass of ocean slipping down my throat
and landing on my hopes, i'm dreaming
off the maps, no hidden grids, i'm fleeing
i worship you like holy days
lying on my back, seeing clouds and rays
drinking lime and bitter from my lemonade
white horses, maritime won't do

do you remember?
the holiday slipped away
time and place
i definitely remember
lying on my back and seeing clouds and rays
we're dreaming with feelings, whoa
forever we're young
pages unsung, ooh
i feel that you remember
dreaming of a past that couldn't last
but now we're changing
refraining

i'm thinkin it's the, know that it's the
i'm thinkin it's the bad, bad blood
i'm thinkin it's the, know that it's the
i'm thinkin it's the bad, bad blood

do you remember?
the riding, the passion, the falling over
and tripping on ice
sharing advice, taking it twice
but let us not forget the
silent days, stripped away
time and place
oh, you choose not to remember
fly away and counting days
i'm hiding from you, ooh

i'm thinkin it's the, know that it's the
i'm thinkin it's the bad, bad blood
i'm thinkin it's the, know that it's the
i'm thinkin it's the bad, bad blood

i choose
for the rain not to fall
exposing the soil on you
i lose
don't tell me i'm cuckoo, i know
and it's mad, we were close, oh
i choose
my head's now afloat
but my heart's drowning boats of you
i lose
don't tell me i'm coo coo
coo coo coo coo coo coo ooh ooh

i'm thinkin it's the, know that it's the
i'm thinkin it is the bad, bad blood
i'm thinkin it is the, know that it's the
i'm thinkin it is the bad, bad blood
i'm thinkin it's the, know that it's the
i'm thinkin it is the bad, bad blood
i'm thinkin it is the, know that it's the
i'm thinkin it is the bad, bad

can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars?
i could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now
can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars?
i could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now

yeah
i could use a dream or a genie or a wish
to go back to a place much simpler than this
'cause after all the partyin' and smashin' and crashin'
and all the glitz and the glam and the fashion
and all the pandemonium and all the madness
there comes a time where you fade to the blackness
and when you starin' at that phone in your lap
and you hopin', but them people never call you back
but that's just how the story unfolds
you get another hand soon after you fold
and when your plans unravel in the sand
what would you wish for if you had one chance?
so airplane, airplane, sorry i'm late
i'm on my way, so don't close that gate
if i don't make that, then i'll switch my flight
and i'll be right back at it by the end of the night

can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars?
i could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now
can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars?
i could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now

yeah, yeah
somebody take me back to the days
before this was a job, before i got paid
before it ever mattered what i had in my bank
yeah, back when i was tryna get a tip at subway
and back when i was rappin' for the hell of it
but nowadays we rappin' to stay relevant
i'm guessin' that if we can make some wishes out of airplanes
then maybe, oh maybe, i'll go back to the days
before the politics that we call the rap game
and back when ain't nobody listened to my mixtape
and back before i tried to cover up my slang
but this is for decatur what's up, bobby ray?
so can i get a wish to end the politics
and get back to the music that started this shit?
so here i stand and then again i say
i'm hopin' we can make some wishes out of airplanes

can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars?
i could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now
can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars?
i could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now

i could really use a wish right now
i, i, i could really use a wish right now
like, like, like shooting stars
i, i, i could really use a wish right now
a wish, a wish right now

if war is holy and sex is obscene
we've got it twisted in this lucid dream
baptised in boundaries, schooled in sin
divided by difference, sexuality and skin

so we can hate each other and fear each other
we can build these walls between each other
baby, blow by blow and brick by brick
keep yourself locked in, yourself locked in
yeah we can hate each other and fear each other
we can build these walls between each other
baby, blow by blow and brick by brick
keep yourself locked in, yourself locked

maybe we should love somebody
maybe we could care a little more
maybe we should love somebody
instead of polishing the bombs of holy war

what if sex was holy and war was obscene
and it wasn't twisted, what a wonderful dream
living for love, unafraid of the end
forgiveness is the only real revenge

so we can heal each other and feel each other
we can break these walls between each other
baby, blow by blow and brick by brick
keep yourself open, yourself open
yeah we can heal each other and feel each other
we can break these walls between each other
baby, blow by blow and brick by brick
keep yourself open, you open

maybe we should love somebody
maybe we could care a little more
maybe we should love somebody
instead of polishing the bombs of holy war

what if love was holy and hate obscene
we should give life to this beautiful dream
cause peace and love ain't so far
if we nurse our wounds before they scar
nurse our wounds before they scar

i thought that this was something, yes
promising that one day it would turn into something, yes
thought the feelings were mutual
and i didn't have to guess
started being skeptical
always unavailable
like you didn't know
but now i'm feeling something, else
that's telling me this may not be the real something, else
but you was showing me
now i'm ready and you running
damn you got me open now
feeling like i'm choking now
where am i to go?

i can't believe that you can't feel my heart
and i can't believe you let me fall so hard
stop playing, how could you let it go this far?
if you had doubts that i wasn't the one
you said that you're the type to take it slow
you said before i step i'll let you know
stop playing before you let me see you with her
you could have told me a change was gon' come. yeah

is she the reason you don't call like you use to?
fall through my hood like you use to?
or put it on me hard like you use to do?
i feel in my mind what's going on
but my heart won't let me go until i know
is she the reason that my calls couldn't reach you?
the deepest of my love couldn't please you?
or bring it to me home like you use to do?
seeing her falling for your charms
got me feeling like i wasn't good enough

see i know we're not official, no
but us being official ain't ever been an issue, no
it came down to us, boy
remember we were different?
we said that we'd talk if we ever had problems about anything
i was cool with no commitment, wait
let me take that back
it was you so i was with it, see
i guess i didn't get when you showed you didn't miss it
now it seems that your interest ain't here
we ain't the same

i can't believe that you can't feel my heart
and i can't believe you let me fall so hard
stop playing, how could you let it go this far?
if you had doubts that i wasn't the one
you said that you're the type to take it slow
you said before i step i'll let you know
stop playing before you let me see you with her

but my heart won't let me go until i know
is she the reason that my calls couldn't reach you?
the deepest of my love couldn't please you?
or bring it to me home like you use to do?
me seeing her falling for your charms
got me feeling like i wasn't good enough

all you had to say was this ain't what you want
i won't be so hurt and i could just move on
you had me believing everything was my fault
but i can see it now
it's a situation that i must let go
cause you ain't gonna be a man and let me know
i guess me seeing you with her tells it all

is she the reason you don't call like you use to?
fall through my hood like you use to?
or put it on me hard like you use to do?
i know in my mind what's going on
but my heart won't let me go until i know
is she the reason that my calls couldn't reach you?
the deepest of my love couldn't please you?
or bring it to me home like you use to do?

seeing her falling for your charms
got me feeling like i wasn't good enough

when you're gone i'm singing blue moon
you turn me all the way around
and i'm tired of the fine line

i just want you to be forever mine

oh and there's nothing i can sing now
that ain't been sung before
oh but your love is a standout
so go on ahead and take the floor

pick me up, don't ever put me down
look i'm tired of the fine line

i just want you to be forever mine
i want you to be forever mine

the way that you move, never seen it before
looking for my head, can t find it no more
you ransom my heart and i get the reward
winning the crown like a trojan horse
i come back, back, back every time
you got me shook like the mobb when they rhyme
come out of nowhere come blessing my life
i just want you to be forever mine, oh oh

be forever mine
be forever mine

oh but you was cookin' up a new stew
must have put something in my food
cause now i'm lost up in the clouds
oh and i'm tired of the fine line

i just want you to be forever mine
oh you gotta be, be forever mine

when bright love turns into hate
you bend, and you bend 'til you break
'til the lights are gone

when the one you care for just takes it all
washing you down like a waterfall
you lose the way and you hit the wall
i'll be the one, i'll be the one, i'll be the one to

carry you home
when it hurts like you've crashed from above
heal your broken bones
when you can't move and your heart's still locked up
you rise, you rise, you rise
sometimes you need someone to carry you home
when it hurts like you've crashed from above
when it's true love

with waters too deep and too cold
sleepless so many nights
with a broken heart running wild

is this the bed i chose to make?
there's greener pastures

wide open spaces far away

all i want is
the wind in my hair
to face the fear but
not feel scared

wild horses
i wanna be like you
throwing caution to the wind
i'll run free too
wish i could recklessly love
like i'm longing to
i wanna run with the wild horses
run with the wild horses

i see the girl i wanna be
riding bareback
carefree along the shore
if only that someone was me
jumping headfirst
headlong without a thought
to act and damn the consequence
how i wish it could be that easy
but fear surrounds me like a fence
i wanna break free

all i want is
the wind in my hair
to face the fear but
not feel scared

wild horses
i wanna be like you
throwing caution to the wind
i'll run free too
wish i could recklessly love
like i'm longing to
i wanna run with the wild horses
run with the wild horses
i wanna run too

recklessly abandoning myself before you
i wanna open up my heart
tell him how i feel

wild horses
i wanna be like you
throwing caution to the wind
i'll run free too
wish i could recklessly love
like i'm longing to
i wanna run with the wild horses

mama, i understand your many sleepless nights
when you sit and you think about father
or how you tried to be the perfect wife

you used to dress and fix your hair
then you smiled through your tears
in the mirror you would stare
and say a prayer
like, "i wish he said i'm beautiful
i wish it didn't hurt at all
i don't know how i got here
i was once the one who had his heart"

until you had enough then you took that ring off

i get scared from the thought
of someone else having your heart
it's been a long time and i don't wanna have to restart
i could go somewhere and try to start over again
but it's not what i want  not what i want 
i don't wanna lose my best friend
"we're in love," is what i say
and nobody's perfect anyway
i don't wanna see something that'll change my mind
everything is cool and we're just fine

i don't wanna go thru your phone
some things are better left unknown
i rather keep livin' in my daydream
keep thinkin' that things are just what they seem

i'mma look away, if you sittin' in front of me
i don't wanna catch a case based on what i see
i'm tellin' you that i trust you
and if you're doin' dirt i ain't even tryna bust you
you know what they say  say, say 
"what you don't know won't hurt you"
we work too hard to build this life
and that won't change over something you type
there's no need to worry, everything is in line
we're in this forever at least in my mind

i don't wanna go thru your phone
some things are better left unknown
i'd rather keep livin' in my daydream
keep thinkin' that things are just what they seem


 turn the lights on 

every night i rush to my bed
with hopes that maybe i'll get a chance to see you
when i close my eyes, i'm going out of my head
lost in a fairytale, can you hold my hands and be my guide?

clouds filled with stars cover your skies
and i hope it rains; you're the perfect lullaby
what kind of dream is this?

you could be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
either way, i don't wanna wake up from you
 turn the lights on 
sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
somebody pinch me, your love's too good to be true
 turn the lights on 
my guilty pleasure, i ain't going nowhere
baby, 'long as you're here, i'll be floating on air
'cause you're mine
you can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
either way i don't wanna wake up from you
 turn the lights on 

i mention you when i say my prayers
i wrap you around all of my thoughts
boy, you're my temporary high
i wish that when i wake up you're there
to wrap your arms around me for real
and tell me you'll stay by my side

clouds filled with stars cover the skies  cover the skies 
and i hope it rains; you're the perfect lullaby
what kind of dream is this?

you could be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
either way i don't wanna wake up from you
 turn the lights on 
sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
somebody pinch me, your love's too good to be true
 turn the lights on 
my guilty pleasure, i ain't going nowhere
baby, 'long as you're here, i'll be floating on air
'cause you're mine
you can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
either way i don't wanna wake up from you
 turn the lights on 

tattoo your name across my heart
so it will remain
not even death could make us part
what kind of dream is this?

you could be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
either way i don't wanna wake up from you
 turn the lights on 
sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
somebody pinch me, your love's too good to be true
 turn the lights on 
my guilty pleasure, i ain't going nowhere
baby, 'long as you're here, i'll be floating on air
'cause you're mine
you can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
either way i don't wanna wake up from you
 turn the lights on 
either way i don't wanna wake up from you


no one makes me feel the way you do inside
and i don't know what i would do without you and that's no lie

if i die, i'd hope to find you in another life
so we could fall again
be the way we were when we first began
like the first time that i ever saw you smile
i want that feeling again
let's be the way we were when we first began

yes, we've got something special, let's hope
hold on and don't let go
and i'll never find another like you and this i know

so we could fall again
let's be the way we were when we first began
like the first time that i ever saw you smile
i want that feeling again
let's be the way we were when we first began

when we first began

so we could fall again

i'm not scared of lions and tigers and bears, no, i'm not
but i'm scared of loving you
i'm not scared to perform at a sold out affair, that's right
but i'm scared of loving you
am i the only one who thinks it's an impossible task?
why it don't last? is that too much to ask?
why do we love love
when love seems to hate us?
sorry if i sound so filled with gloom
you say you care and i know you do
but this is from my experience
and my conclusion only makes sense
just 'cause i love you and you love me
it doesn't mean that we're meant to be
i can climb mountains, swim 'cross the seas
but the most frightening thing is you and me
i'm not scared of lions and tigers and bears, no, i'm not
but i'm scared of loving you
i'm not scared to perform at a sold out affair, that's right
but i'm scared of loving you
am i the only one who thinks it's an impossible task?
why it don't last? is that too much to ask?
why do we love love
when love seems to hate us?
most circumstances, i know my fate
but in this love thing, i don't get the game
why does it feel like those who give in
they only wind up losing a friend?
just 'cause i love you and you love me
it doesn't mean that we'll ever be
fly 'cross the ocean, sing for the queen
but the most frightening thing is you and me
i'm not scared of lions and tigers and bears, oh my
but i'm scared of loving you
i'm not scared to perform at a sold out affair, that's right
but i'm scared of loving you
am i the only one who thinks it's an impossible task?
why it don't last? is that too much to ask?
why do we love love
when love seems to hate us?
i'm not sure though i'm not sure
but if we never try, we'll never know
it's better to have loved then not to love at all
not trying is worse than to stumble and fall
and if we do, i'd rather it be with you
'cause at least there will be sweet memories
oh, i'm not scared
i'm not scared of lions and tigers and bears, no, i'm not
but i'm scared of loving you
i'm not scared to perform at a sold out affair, that's right
but i'm scared of loving you
am i the only one who thinks it's an impossible task?
why it don't last? is that too much to ask?
why do we love love
when love seems to hate us?

ayer los dos so  bamos con un mundo perfecto
ayer a nuestros labios les sobraban las palabras
porque en los ojos nos espi bamos el alma
y la verdad no vacilaba en tu mirada
ayer nos prometimos conquistar el mundo entero
ayer tú me juraste que este amor seria eterno
por que una vez equivocarse es suficiente
para aprender lo que es amar sinceramente

qu  hiciste? hoy destruiste con tu orgullo la esperanza
hoy empa aste con tu furia mi mirada
borraste toda nuestra historia con tu rabia
y confundiste tanto amor que te entregaba
como permiso para as  romperme el alma

qu  hiciste? nos obligaste a destruir las madrugadas
y nuestras noches las ahogaron tus palabras
mis ilusiones acabaron con tus falsas
se te olvido que era el amor lo que importaba
y con tus manos derrumbaste nuestra casa

ma ana que amanezca un d a nuevo en mi universo
ma ana no ver  tu nombre escrito entre mis versos
no escuchare palabras de arrepentimiento
ignorare sin pena tu remordimiento
ma ana olvidare que ayer yo fui tu fiel amante
ma ana ni siquiera habr  razones para odiarte
yo borrare todos tus sue os de mis sue os
que el viento arrastre para siempre tus recuerdos

qu  hiciste? hoy destruiste con tu orgullo la esperanza
hoy empa aste con tu furia mi mirada
borraste toda nuestra historia con tu rabia
y confundiste tanto amor que te entregaba
como permiso para as  romperme el alma

qu  hiciste? nos obligaste a destruir las madrugadas
y nuestras noches las ahogaron tus palabras
mis ilusiones acabaron con tus falsas
se te olvido que era el amor lo que importaba
y con tus manos derrumbaste nuestra casa

y confundiste tanto amor que te entregaba
como permiso para as  romperme el alma

qu  hiciste? nos obligaste a destruir las madrugadas
y nuestras noches las borraron tus palabras
mis ilusiones acabaron con tus falsas
se te olvido que era el amor lo que importaba
y con tus manos derrumbaste nuestra casa

there are moments that the words don't reach
there is suffering too terrible to name
you hold your child as tight as you can
then push away the unimaginable
the moments when you're in so deep
feels easier to just swim down
and so they move uptown
and learn to live with the unimaginable
i spend hours in the garden
i walk alone to the store
and it's quiet uptown
i never liked the quiet before
i take the children to church on sunday
a sign of the cross at the door
and i pray
that never used to happen before

if you see him in the street walking by himself
talking to himself, have pity
you would like it uptown, it's quiet uptown
he is working through the unimaginable
his hair has gone grey, he passes every day
they say he walks the length of the city
you knock me out, i fall apart
can you imagine?

look at where we are
look at where we started
i know i don't deserve you
but hear me out, that would be enough
if i could spare his life
if i could trade his life for mine
he'd be standing here right now
and you would smile
and that would be enough
i don't pretend to know
the challenges we're facing
i know there's no replacing what we've lost
and you need time
but i'm not afraid
i know who i married
just let me stay here by your side
and that would be enough

if you see him in the street, walking by her side
talking by her side, have pity
do you like it uptown? it's quiet uptown
he is trying to do the unimaginable
if you see him walking in the park, long after dark
taking in the sights of the city
look around, look around, look around
they are trying to do the unimaginable

there are moments that the words don't reach
there's a grace too powerful to name
we push away what we could never understand
we push away the unimaginable
they are standing in the garden
standing there side by side
she takes his hand
it's quiet uptown
forgiveness, can you imagine?
forgiveness, can you imagine?

if you see him in the street, walking by her side
talking by her side, have pity
look around, look around
they are going through the unimaginable


oh, no
no, no
no, no
no, no
no, no

i was getting to feel
all the way  by the way you comb your hair 
keepin' it real
"give your all," you would say to me
only way to know your heart  if i call you now

and the fear of the unknown that moves too close  real close

these are my confessions
just when i thought i said all i could say
my chick on the side said she got one on the way
these are my confessions
man, i'm throwed and i don't know what to do
i guess i gotta give part two of my confessions
if i'm gonna tell it, then i gotta tell it all
damn near cried when i got that phone call
i'm so throwed, i don't know what to do
but to give you part two of my confessions

now, this gon' be the hardest thing i think i ever had to do
got me talking to myself, asking how i'm gon' tell you
'bout that chick on part one i told y'all i was creeping with, creeping with
said she's three months pregnant and she's keeping it
the first thing that came to mind was you
second thing was how do i know if it's mine and is it true
third thing was me wishing that i never did what i did
how i ain't ready for no kid and bye bye to our relationship

these are my confessions
just when i thought i said all i could say
my chick on the side said she got one on the way
these are my confessions
man, i'm throwed and i don't know what to do
i guess i gotta give part two of my confessions
if i'm gonna tell it, then i gotta tell it all
damn near cried when i got that phone call
i'm so throwed, i don't know what to do
but to give you part two of my confessions

sitting here, stuck on stupid, trying to figure out
when, what, and how i'ma let this come out of my mouth
said it ain't gon' be easy
but i need to stop thinking, contemplating
be a man and get it over with, over with
i'm riding in my whip, racing to her place
talking to myself, preparing to tell her to her face
she open up the door and didn't want to come near me
i said "one second, baby, please hear me"

these are my confessions
just when i thought i said all i could say
my chick on the side said she got one on the way
these are my confessions
man, i'm throwed and i don't know what to do
i guess i gotta give part two of my confessions
if i'm gonna tell it, then i gotta tell it all
damn near cried when i got that phone call
i'm so throwed, i don't know what to do
but to give you part two of my confessions

this by far is the hardest thing i think i've ever had to do
to tell you, the woman i love
that i'm having a baby by a woman that i barely even know
i hope you can accept the fact that i'm man enough to tell you this
and hopefully you'll give me another chance
this ain't about my career
this ain't about my life
it's about us
please

these are my confessions
just when i thought i said all i could say
my chick on the side said she got one on the way
these are my confessions

before anything began between us
you were like my best friend
the one i used to run and talk to when me and my girl was having problems
you used to say it would be okay
suggest little nice things i should do
and when i go home at night and lay my head down
all i seem to think about is you
and how...

knowing it should've been you
what's sad is i love her, but i'm falling for you
what should i do?

should i, do exactly what i feel inside?
'cause i, i don't wanna go, don't need to stay
but i really need to get it together

start a new relationship with you, this is what you do
think about a ring and all the things that come along with
you make me, you make me

at this point, the situation's out of control
i never meant to hurt her, but i gotta let her go
and she may not understand it while all of this is going on
i tried, i tried to fight it, but the feeling's just too strong

'cause you've made me that much stronger

well, i thought i knew you, thinkin' that you were true
guess i, i couldn't trust, called your bluff, time is up
'cause i've had enough
you were there by my side, always down for the ride
but your joy ride just came down in flames
'cause your greed sold me out in shame, mhm

after all of the stealing and cheating
you probably think that i hold resentment for you
but uh uh, oh no, you're wrong
'cause if it wasn't for all that you tried to do, i wouldn't know
just how capable i am to pull through
so i want to say thank you, 'cause it

makes me that much stronger

makes me that much smarter
so thanks for making me a fighter
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh oh oh, yeah, yeah, aha

never saw it coming, all of your backstabbing
just so you could cash in on a good thing
before i'd realize your game, aha
i heard you're goin' 'round playin' the victim now
but don't even begin feeling i'm the one to blame
'cause you dug your own grave

after all of the fights and the lies
'cause you're wanting to haunt me
but that won't work anymore, no more aha, it's over
'cause if it wasn't for all of your torture
i wouldn't know how to be this way now and never back down
so i want to say thank you, 'cause it

makes me that much stronger
makes me work a little bit harder
it makes me that much wiser
so thanks for making me a fighter
made me learn a little bit faster
made my skin a little bit thicker
makes me that much smarter
so thanks for making me a fighter

how could this man i thought i knew
turn out to be unjust, so cruel?
could only see the good in you
pretended not to know the truth
you tried to hide your lies, disguise yourself
through living in denial
but in the end you'll see, you won't stop me
i am a fighter and i  i'm a fighter 
i ain't gonna stop  i ain't gonna stop 
there is no turning back, i've had enough

makes me that much stronger
makes me work a little bit harder  yeah

to my fellas
i like the way you work that
to my ladies
you sure know how to work that


seems like it was yesterday when i saw your face
you told me how proud you were, but i walked away
if only i knew what i know today

i would hold you in my arms
i would take the pain away
thank you for all you've done
forgive all your mistakes
there's nothing i wouldn't do
to hear your voice again
sometimes i wanna call you, but i know you won't be there

oh, i'm sorry for blaming you
for everything i just couldn't do
and i've hurt myself by hurting you

some days i feel broke inside, but i won't admit
sometimes i just wanna hide 'cause it's you i miss
and it's so hard to say goodbye when it comes to this

would you tell me i was wrong?
would you help me understand?
are you lookin' down upon me?
are you proud of who i am?
there's nothing i wouldn't do
to have just one more chance
to look into your eyes and see you looking back

oh, i'm sorry for blaming you
for everything i just couldn't do
and i've hurt myself
oh, oh

if i had just one more day
i would tell you how much that
i've missed you since you've been away
oh, it's dangerous
it's so out of line
to try and turn back time

oh, i'm sorry for blaming you
for everything i just couldn't do
and i've hurt myself by hurting you


notice me
take my hand
why are we
strangers when
our love is strong?
why carry on without me?

and every time i try to fly, i fall
without my wings, i feel so small
i guess i need you, baby
and every time i see you in my dreams
i see your face, it's haunting me
i guess i need you, baby

i make believe
that you are here
it's the only way
i see clear
what have i done?
you seem to move on easy

and every time i try to fly, i fall
without my wings, i feel so small
i guess i need you, baby
and every time i see you in my dreams
i see your face, you're haunting me
i guess i need you, baby

i may have made it rain
please forgive me
my weakness caused you pain
and this song's my sorry
at night i pray
that soon your face will fade away

and every time i try to fly, i fall
without my wings, i feel so small
i guess i need you, baby
and every time i see you in my dreams
i see your face, you're haunting me
i guess i need you, baby


i've been called a fool before
but i just think i'm solely confused
you were supposed to be my pillow
waiting for me to crawl back home
i've been told a few truths before
for one that was never fair to you
but now you will and i wanna tell you i love you
whatever you chose to do

but every now and then i wanna run back to you
every now and then i just might lose my mind
every now and then i wanna hold you tightly
like the neck of a third glass of wine

nowadays it's just me and my pillow
slowly drowning, slowly drowning in the light
staring out my sight sore window
wishing i could crawl back into your life

every now and then i wanna run back to you
every now and then i just might lose my mind
every now and then i wanna hold you tightly
like the neck of my third glass of wine

please tell me our love's not gone
tell me baby
oh tell me baby
one more time


i woke up with a fear this morning
but i can taste you on the tip of my tongue
alone without no warning
you're by my side and we've got smoke in our lungs

last night we were way up, kissing in the back of the cab
and then you say, "love, baby, let's go back to my flat"
and when we wake up, never had a feeling like that
i got a reason, so man, put that record on again

i don't wanna hear sad songs anymore
i only wanna hear love songs
i found my heart up in this place tonight
don't wanna sing mad songs anymore
only wanna sing your song
'cause your song's got me feeling like i'm

i'm in love, i'm in love, i'm in love
yeah, you know, your song's got me feeling like i'm

no fear but i think i'm falling, i'm not proud
but i'm usually the type of girl that would hit and run
no risk so i think i'm all in
when i kiss your lips, feel my heartbeat thump

and now we're way up, dancing on the roof of the house
and then we make love, right there on your best friend's couch
and then you say "love, this is what it's all about"
so keep on kissing my mouth and put that record on again

i don't wanna hear sad songs anymore
i only wanna hear love songs
i found my heart up in this place tonight
don't wanna sing mad songs anymore
only wanna sing your song
'cause your song's got me feeling like i'm

i'm in love, i'm in love, i'm in love

it was cool, but it was all pretend
yeah, yeah, since you been gone
you dedicated, you took the time
wasn't long till i called you mine
yeah, yeah, since you been gone

and all you'd ever hear me say
is how i pictured me with you
that's all you'd ever hear me say

but since you been gone
i can breathe for the first time
i'm so moving on, yeah, yeah
thanks to you, now i get what i want
since you been gone

yeah, yeah, since you been gone

how come i'd never hear you say
i just wanna be with you  be with you 
i guess you never felt that way

but since you been gone
i can breathe for the first time
i'm so moving on, yeah, yeah
thanks to you, now i get, i get what i want
since you been gone

you had your chance, you blew it
out of sight, out of mind
shut your mouth, i just can't take it
again and again and again and again

since you been gone  since you been gone 
i can breathe for the first time
i'm so moving on, yeah, yeah

since you been gone

hmm mmm aah
just me and my thoughts
and some gin and juice
a little gift to myself that i bought
for years of scraping behind you
it wasn't so bad though
you know i can say i learned a lot
maybe better me than you though
but still why did i get caught
don't hold my hand boy
don't hold my hand, oh no no no
let go my hand boy
let it go let it go let it go
don't hold my hand
in my ear i, i hear you whisper low
 let it go, let it go 
trying your best to excite me
 move along, move along 
 cause you know you must leave me
more than one or two
fiery nights broke out
so many times i ended up on
on the pavement
but now i'm crying out
don't hold my hand boy
don't hold my hand
let go my hand boy
hmm don't hold my hand

you're always on my mind 

boy, i can't seem to get you outta my head
but there's something about you that makes me smile
don't change, i like the way you make me feel
can we take our time and do this for a while
girl, i never thought i'd find someone to love me
now, you're the only one i want in my life
and the special touch you give comes from you only
i guess that's why you're always on my mind

you're always on my mind
you're always on my mind
you're always on my mind
you're always on my mind

sometimes, i find it hard to concentrate
because thoughts of us together fill my head
when you're away, it's hard to sleep at night
so, my pillow, like my thoughts of you, i hold tight
girl, i never thought i'd find someone to love me
now, you're the only one i want in my life
and the special tough you give comes from you only
i guess that's why you're always on my mind


thinking 'bout ya, thinking 'bout ya, i can't stop thinking 'bout ya
 on my mind 



it's a glowing little feeling
like a summer sun that slowly rises
on a new horizon of love
and it's more exotic than jamaica
or the rain that falls in costa rica
like a waterfall to the sea

i would like to thank the judges for picking me
my parents who i love, i love you, houston

and i've been drifting off on knowledge
cat calls on cat walks, man these women getting solemn
i could sing a song for a solomon or salamander
we took a flight at midnight and now my mind can't help but wonder:
how come?
spoon fed pluralized eyes to find the beaches in the forest
when i'm looking off the edge, i preach my gut it can't help but ignore it
i'm climbing up the walls cause all the shit i hear is boring
all the shit i do is boring, all these record labels boring
i don't trust these record labels, i'm torn
all these people on the planet working 9 to 5 just to stay alive
the 9 to 5 just to stay alive, the 9 to 5 just to stay alive
the 9 to 5 just to stay alive, the 9 to 5 just to stay alive
the 9 to 5 just to stay alive, the 9 to 5 just to stay alive
all the people on the planet working 9 to 5 just to stay alive, how come?

and it became painfully clear that we
we would never see those days again

doesn't last too long these days, hey
and i tried to believe that we could make it
but trying don't work, so i just have to face that forever
doesn't last too long these days, hey
verse:2
still think about the good times we had
and how you used to make me laugh
but baby i know most times we miserable
so everytime i wanna call, baby what always helps
is when i think of the pain, and i realize
i'm better off by myself

cause forever, doesn't last too long forever

doesn't last too long these days, hey
and i tried to believe that we could make it
but trying don't work, so i just have to face that forever
doesn't last too long these days, hey

and i tried to believe that we could make it
but trying don't work, so i just have to face that forever

how could i throw away a miracle?
how could i face another day?
it's all of my doing, i made a choice
and today, i pay
my heart is full of pain
how could you understand, the way i feel?
how could you relate to so much pain?
seems as though nothing can comfort me
so today, i pray
that someone should listen, for

nothing should matter
not when love grows inside you
the choice is yours
there's a miracle in store
nothing should matter
not when love grows inside you
a voice of love is crying out
don't throw love away
there's a miracle in store

how could i let go of a miracle?
nothing cold ever take its place
thought i was looking, out for myself
now it seems the pain
is all that i have gained
i wonder if i could be your miracle
i wonder if i could spare you pain
seems as though nothing will comfort me
lord, less today, i pray
that you should come listen

nothing should matter
not when love grows inside you
the choice is yours
there's a miracle in store
nothing should matter
not when love grows inside you
a voice of love is crying out
don't throw love away
there's a miracle in store

don't ever throw away your miracle
don't let it slip away
nothing should matter

nothing should matter
not when love grows inside you
the choice is yours
there's a miracle in store
nothing should matter
not when love grows inside you
a voice of love is crying out
don't throw love away
there's a miracle in store

no chocolate covered candy hearts to give away
no first of spring, no song to sing

no harvest moon to light one tender august night
no autumn breeze
no falling leaves
not even time for birds to fly to southern skies
no libra sun
no halloween
no giving thanks to all the christmas joy you bring
but what it is, though old so new
to fill your heart like no three words could ever do

i just called to say i love you

and i mean it from the bottom of my heart

some people live for the fortune
some people live just for the fame
some people live for the power, yeah
some people live just to play the game
some people think
that the physical things
define what's within
and i've been there before
that life's a bore
so full of the superficial

some people want it all
but i don't want nothing at all
if it ain't you, baby
if i ain't got you, baby
some people want diamond rings
some just want everything
but everything means nothing
if i ain't got you, yeah

some people search for a fountain
promises forever young
some people need three dozen roses
and that's the only way to prove you love them
hand me the world on a silver platter
and what good would it be
with no one to share
no one who truly cares for me

some people want it all
but i don't want nothing at all
if it ain't you, baby
if i ain't got you, baby
some people want diamond rings
some just want everything
but everything means nothing
if i ain't got you, you, you
some people want it all
but i don't want nothing at all
if it ain't you, baby
if i ain't got you, baby
some people want diamond rings
some just want everything
but everything means nothing
if i ain't got you, yeah

if i ain't got you with me, baby oh
said nothing in this whole wide world don't mean a thing
if i ain't got you with me, baby


closed off from love, i didn't need the pain
once or twice was enough and it was all in vain
time starts to pass, before you know it you're frozen
but something happened for the very first time with you
my heart melted to the ground
found something true
and everyone's looking round thinking i'm going crazy

but i don't care what they say, i'm in love with you
they try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth
my heart's crippled by the vein that i keep on closing
you cut me open and i

keep bleeding
keep, keep bleeding love
i keep bleeding
i keep, keep bleeding love
keep bleeding
keep, keep bleeding love
you cut me open

trying hard not to hear, but they talk so loud
their piercing sounds fill my ears, try to fill me with doubt
yet i know that their goal is to keep me from falling
but nothing's greater than the risk
that comes with your embrace
and in this world of loneliness, i see your face
yet everyone around me thinks that i'm going crazy
maybe, maybe

but i don't care what they say, i'm in love with you
they try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth
my heart's crippled by the vein that i keep on closing
you cut me open and i

keep bleeding
keep, keep bleeding love
i keep bleeding
i keep, keep bleeding love
keep bleeding
keep, keep bleeding love
you cut me open

and it's draining all of me
though they find it hard to believe
i'll be wearing these scars for everyone to see

but i don't care what they say, i'm in love with you
they try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth
my heart's crippled by the vein that i keep on closing
you cut me open and i

keep bleeding
keep, keep bleeding love
i keep bleeding
i keep, keep bleeding love
keep bleeding
keep, keep bleeding love
 ooh, you cut me open and i 
keep bleeding
keep, keep bleeding love
i keep bleeding
i keep, keep bleeding love
keep bleeding
keep, keep bleeding love

ooh, you cut me open and i
keep bleeding
keep, keep bleeding love

ayer los dos so  bamos con un mundo perfecto

porque en los ojos nos espi bamos el alma

when i sleep  i have dreams about the way we used to kiss
'bout the way you used to hold me
and say nothing would ever harm me
when we first met, oh, how you charmed me
made me smile when i was down
big pimping around the town, you and me
whenever they'd see you, they'd see me
a lover and a friend to me you were, how did it end?
how it hurts to not have you in my life
when i wanted to be your wife

you never know what you have 'til it's gone
treated you wrong for so long
now you're gone away
but the love still lives here

still, i still got love for you
still, after all we've been through
still, i gave my heart to you
and baby, you're the only one  the only one 
there's other men than you
still, they can come close to you
still, once i said, "i love you"
i knew you'd be the only one

a good man you were to me, always there to care
would do anything in this world for me  oh, oh 
didn't matter, what, when, or where, you were there
i never thought we'd part from the arguments we'd start
when i just wanted to get some attention  sorry 
and i'm sorry, baby for bitching
if i could take back the words
that i said to make you leave
i'd be down on bended knees
asking you to please forgive me

you never know what you have 'til it's gone
treated you wrong for so long
now you're gone away
but the love still lives here

still, i still got love for you
still, after all we've been through
still, i gave my heart to you
and baby, you're the only one  the only one 
there's other men than you
still, they can come close to you
still, once i said, "i love you"
i knew you'd be the only one

all of the good times we had together  together 
do they mean something to you?
do you ever wish we never split?
'cause i still got love for you

still, i still got love for you
still, after all we've been through
still, i gave my heart to you  gave my heart to you 
and baby, you're the only one
there's other men than you  there's other men than you 
still, they can come close to you
still, once i said, "i love you"
i knew you'd be the only one
still, i still got love for you  still got love 
still, after all we've been through
still, i gave my heart to you
and baby, you're the only one
there's other men than you
still, they can come close to you  i love you 
still, once i said, "i love you"
i knew you'd be the only one


we could be soulmates
we could be so great
we could be happy

so, let's deal with the problem
you see, i've been through this myself, and, let's talk
and it goes a little something like this   hit it
mmm...

baby girl  unfair but true 
can love him once but not twice
who plays games with no rules  a fool 
tears for fears  are no surprise 
happens almost every time
love knocks you on your behind
 loved you hard, loved you long, now his love is gone 
love 'em and leave 'em  is the rule of most dogs 
you must be strong
stand up on your own
take control of your life

i've seen it time and time again
it's not worth it, no
don't be down and miserable
you and only you
can bring yourself around

give it up, turn it loose
oh, if he don't want ya, you don't need 'em, girl, yeah
give it up, turn it loose
oh, yeah

fact of life  so sad but true 
love can often hurt you
leaving scars most of your life  nightmares can haunt you 
but fairytales of love can come true
both play tricks on your mind
 you'll be fine, take this time to find piece of mind 
sooner or later  bad feelings will die 
you must be strong
don't blame it all on love
in time good things will come

i've seen it time and time again
it's not worth it, no no
don't be down and miserable
you and only you
can bring yourself around

give it up, turn it loose
oh, if he don't want ya, you don't need 'em, girl... yeah
give it up, turn it loose
oh, yeah

 give it up  give it up, oh
 give up  give it up
 give up  give it up
 give it up, turn it loose  turnin' it loose, baby
 give up  give it up
 give up  give it up
 give it up, turn it loose  turnin' it loose, baby
 give up  give it, give it, give it, give it
 give up  give it, give it, give it, give it
 give it up, turn it loose  and turn it loose
 give up  hey
 give up  turn it loose
 give it up, turn it loose 


how did you get here? nobody's supposed to be here
i tried that love thing for the last time
my heart says "no, no." nobody's supposed to be here
but you came along and changed my mind

i've spent all my life on a search to find
the love who'll stay for eternity
the heaven sent to fulfill my needs
but when i turn around, again, love has knocked me down
my heart got broken, oh it hurts so bad
i'm sad to say love wins again

so i placed my heart under lock and key
to take some time to take care of me
but i turn around and you're standing here


this time i swear i'm through
but, if only you knew how many times i've said those words
then fall again, when will i ever learn?
knowing these tears i cry, this lovely black butterfly
must take a chance, and spread my wings
love can make you do some crazy things



ali shaheed, on the mix
kickin' it with angie stone
uh, take it back, take it back

tell me what is up with you
heard you got a brand new crew
spending money like you rich
tryin' to keep up with your bitch
seems somewhere you lost your soul
'cause you forgot the debt you owe
left me hanging out to dry
but all the time i'll tell you why

'cause i got a bone to pick with you
ain't nothing new under the sun
and i got a talk to have with you
so baby, if it fits, then wear the shoe

now baby i tried my best to see
i'm stackin' the odds at one to three
i'm givin' the benefit to you
meanwhile i'm losing all access to you
and baby, you played me like a flute
caressing me softly with the boot
you're feeding me lovin' lies for food
i'm waiting for one moment of truth

'cause i got a bone to pick with you
ain't nothing new under the sun
and i got a talk to have with you
so baby, if it fits, then wear the shoe

you don't like this love i'm givin'
boy, don't fake the feelin'
keep it real with me
you're living too fast
and all around you's movin' slow, so slow
it's better to keep it cool
than blow it just for show
so hold onto love if you can remember it
and somewhere you lost your soul
'cause you forgot the debt you owed
you left me hanging out to dry
but all the time i'll tell you why

'cause i got a bone to pick with you
ain't nothing new under the sun
and i got a talk to have with you
so baby, if it fits, you better wear the shoe

baby, there's something you should know
whatever deed you plant will grow
but nothing will interrupt it's flow
 listen when i talk to you 
you only get out just what you give
together it's not all negative
beware of how you live
see, it makes no sense to me, babe

'cause i got a bone to pick with you, yeah
ain't nothing new under the sun
and i got a talk to have with you
so baby, if it fits, then wear the shoe
'cause i got a bone to pick with you
ain't nothing new under the sun
and i got a talk to have with you
so baby, if it fits, then wear the shoe
'cause i got a bone to pick with you
ain't nothing new under the sun
and i got a talk to have with you
so baby, if it fits, then wear the shoe
'cause i got a bone to pick with you
ain't nothing new under the sun
and i got a talk to have with you



you don't have to cry yourself to sleep at night with wet pillows
girl, i know you're hurt
did you know that you can dry your pillows with your dreams and smile
it really works
lay your head back in my arms, oh, i know your worth
so just reach inside your heart and pack your bags
and let's leave this earth

let's aim high, oh girl
all you gotta do is close your eyes, inhale the sigh and visualize
let's aim high

you work so hard for your boss, to him it's just work
never considers your dreams, selfish and mean
damn, that's gotta hurt
just lay your head back in my arms, girl
i know you're worth
so allow me to abduct your mind with these words
open your eyes, you're now a bird


you possess the power to do
if you concentrate, mountains will move
if you just believe that it's true
please make no mistake, i'll be there too

you possess the power to do
if you concentrate, mountains will move
and if you just believe that it's true
make no mistake, i'll be there too
let's aim high


i feel a cold flush going through my hair
and hey you know what
i don't even care
the time has passed me by
it's gone with the wind
it's all because the sun shined once again
now the party's on
everybody's there
and if you don't know anyone
you'll still meet some new friends
that's the way it is
when i have myself a drink
all because the sun shines once again

let the sunshine
let the sunshine baby
let it all go
let it all go baby
let the sunshine
let the sunshine baby
let it all go
let it all go baby

so turn the lights off
ain't no one afraid
when the night comes
it'll be just like the day
and without the day
i am glowing from within
all because the sun shined once again
so play that sweet tune
play it through the air
and the volume
raise it up
don't you ask me twice
you know i'm gonna bid
all because the sun shined once again


i know that the world is gonna smile again
when we go from the darkness into the light
ohhh
let the sun shine...
let the sun shine...

yeah eh eyy yeah


 turn the lights on 

every night i rush to my bed
with hopes that maybe i'll get a chance to see you
when i close my eyes, i'm going out of my head
lost in a fairytale, can you hold my hands and be my guide?

clouds filled with stars cover your skies
and i hope it rains; you're the perfect lullaby
what kind of dream is this?

you could be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
either way, i don't wanna wake up from you
 turn the lights on 
sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
somebody pinch me, your love's too good to be true
 turn the lights on

'cause you're mine
you can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
either way i don't wanna wake up from you
 turn the lights on 

i mention you when i say my prayers
i wrap you around all of my thoughts
boy, you're my temporary high
i wish that when i wake up you're there
to wrap your arms around me for real
and tell me you'll stay by my side

clouds filled with stars cover the skies  cover the skies 
and i hope it rains; you're the perfect lullaby
what kind of dream is this?

you could be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
either way i don't wanna wake up from you

since day one i said fuck the fame and everything it dealt
but the fame is really here just to facilitate the wealth
but the wealth attracts you haters like mosquitos to a well
and the waters getting deeper so i must set out to sail
someone called my cell, and left a voicemail
they said congratulations on the million record sales
as i'm flippin over furniture, knockin' shit off the shelf
i told myself i'd never get too deep to take a breath but i'm sinkin

and it's so hard to breathe, yeah
and even more so to sleep when no one cares
it was all i could need
but now i'm sinking, so deep, i can't come up for air

yeah, i've seen the valley of the shadow of death
i've seen the mountains, a wild childhood
that's why i sing about it
i just try to move on and keep my peace about it
but come to think about it i can't even count the days
that i spent starvin' tryin' to find a some decent housing
it's why i'm always smiling but on this beat i seem so violent
so ask me about the music scene and what the fuck i think about it
time flies i guess that's why i'm buggin
just yesterday i was rappin with my brother and my cousin
if you had the stove or toaster on you couldn't use the oven
we knew that we were struggling we just actin like we wasn't
it was either make it rapping, if not that then hustling
so all i see is magazine covers in this game
you either surface or you plummet
it's a thin line and i'm just tryin to keep my head above it, damn

and it's so hard to breathe, yeah
and even more so to sleep when no one cares
it was all i could need
but now i'm sinking, so deep, i can't come up for air
air i  i sink away 
air  i sink away 
air  as i sink away  i  damn i sink away 
damn air damn pots and pans
get carried away damn get carried away it
was never in the plans
but hey, it's long way from beatin' pots and pans

and it's so hard to breathe, yeah
and even more so to sleep when no one cares
it was all i could need
but now i'm sinking, so deep, i can't come up for air
damn it was never in the plans
but hey, it's a long way from beatin' pots and pans
but now i'm sinking so deep i can't come up for air, air, ah

sneakin' in l.a. when the lights are low
off of one touch, i could overdose
you said, "stop playin' it safe
girl, i wanna see you lose control"

just like nicotine, heroin, morphine
suddenly, i'm a fiend and you're all i need
all i need, yeah, you're all i need

i wonder why i need to know?
i wonder why i need to know?
i wonder why?
chorus:
to realize my dreams and right the wrongs i see
things and what they seem
i wonder why through schemes
cause i need to know
verse 1:
i wonder why some niggas wanna run, before they can crawl when the writing is scrawled all over the wall
can't front i used to didn't see it before
or maybe i didn't think i was who the message was for
now i examine issues to the core
kind of like i do metaphors
think about friends i don't see no more
like my ex best friend nica
when we met in gym class, she rocked diadora sneakers
we go back like that even before rap
met little duns together, riding bikes in hot weather
on the ave. catching twin ass cracks
we used to mishaps,  too many laughs that ended
now i passed on cross, fences need to be mended
i wonder if today she feels the loss like i often do
memories made more than a few
still go a lot of places that i been with you
you moved away, heard you stayin' in atlanta
i have to check you when i do a show, just to say
"yo, been on my mind lately and i though you should know."
chorus  2x :
to realize my dreams and right the wrongs i see
things and what they seem
i wonder why through schemes
cause i need to know
verse 2:
since last contact a lot has happened
you been knew i was rapping
done a little traveling
performing and recording my craft
i'm breaking through at last
you know the math, how i pay dues with the dead man crew
carlos and me vick and 
took mad flicks on 76th ave.,
in flushing, queens cutting hair at marie's
now he's over seas at the military
still this music shit is post primary
just seen anthony on the train
he doing his thang
we cool but his priorities changed
the rest of the same
ain't seen old what's his name in eons
yo how's ya moms
yo, mom's is fine, my godmother nancy died
 rest in peace  two years ago in april
damn, time flies, plus matthew committed suicide
 rest in peace 
i can't even cry but it still blows my mind
he left a lot of friends behind when he was alive
he asked about you from time to time, "yo, how's nica?"
i replied, "ain't seen her or heard from her."
he thought it was a shame but i guess that's just the way
it goes friends grow apart, why, i don't know
people grow apart, why, i don't know
friends grow apart, why, i don't know
damn, i wish i knew
chorus  2x :
to realize my dreams and right the wrongs i see
things and what they seem
i wonder why through schemes
cause i need to know
verse 3:
through life we feel joy and pain
stick and move to gains
silent footin' in these insane time
it's a battle just maintaining a vibe
motherfuckers leaving me mentally fried
but i can't be denied. look at me
i'm moving mountains with rhymes
must be the grand design
i met the love of my life
he wasn't mister right, but i'm still living, still building
want a career and children, be set set with millions
and never let it go to my head
someone wise once said
we only value what's out of reach, or dead
haven't been close to mega long
i hope nothing is wrong
you been healthy and strong
i wrote this song when remembering when
hoping maybe we can grieve again
if we ever meet again
cause right now i could really use a friend from back then
chorus  4x :
to realize my dreams and right the wrongs i see
things and what they seem
i wonder why through schemes
cause i need to know
tell me, i need to know
i wonder why, i need to know
tell me
i wonder why
tell me, i need to know
i wonder why

only love could bring us
bring us to this bitter plane
only one of us
who's gonna walk away
here in the deep below
that only darkness really knows
i'm hoping for a humble seed to grow
no, i won't surrender to this hard hearted night
though i know the sun's gonna bring the palest of light
and all that remains is everything has gone
this life is mine so i'll carry on

i'm just trying to hold on
i'm falling in the dark below
i feel i'm falling in the big unknown
here in the deep below
i will rise
i will rise again
a humble seed will grow

i have to go back
to pull me from the wreck
i know it's not over yet
there's no fire and no flame
on this cold, cold plane
no way to measure my pain

i'm just trying to hold on
i'm falling in the dark below
i feel i'm falling in the big unknown
i will rise
i will rise
i will rise again
a humble seed will grow


i'm tryin' to hold my breath
let it stay this way
can't let this moment end
you set off a dream in me
getting louder now
can you hear it echoing?

take my hand
will you share this with me?
'cause darling, without you

all the shine of a thousand spotlights
all the stars we steal from the night sky
will never be enough, never be enough
towers of gold are still too little
these hands could hold the world, but it'll
never be enough, never be enough for me

never, never
never, never
never, for me, for me
never enough, never enough, never enough
for me, for me, for me

all the shine of a thousand spotlights
all the stars we steal from the night sky
will never be enough, never be enough
towers of gold are still too little
these hands could hold the world, but it'll
never be enough, never be enough for me

never, never

never, for me, for me
never enough, never, never
never enough, never, never
never enough
for me, for me, for me

there's a boy i know, he's the one i dream of
looks into my eyes, takes me to the clouds above
ooh i lose control, can't seem to get enough
when i wake from dreaming, tell me is it really love?

my man was steady stacking chips, riding in the classy whips
living every day like his birthday
and house gotta door with the door man

is to be loved, from the top of your head
down to your pretty pedicure toes, whoa

needed to be loved, from deep inside of your mind
down to the depths of your soul, oh
you wanna be loved
you see love lasts long, after all the money comes and goes
what profit a man, to gain the whole wide world
to lose his girl, lose his girl. hey it means nothing in life unless i got you
if i was your man, i'd do all that i can to keep you girl
yeah, i'd do what i can, what profit a man
to get these material things, and turn around and lose your queen
the one who was there, ridin' for you when it was all just a dream
how you gonna get brand new
with the only girl who ever loved you, ooh baby
what profit a man, to gain the whole wide world
to lose his girl, lose his girl, hey i'd rather not lose you baby
if i was your man, i'd do all that i can to keep you girl
just to keep you, what profit a man
what profit a man, to gain the whole wide world

i've been waiting to come alive
you stared into my eyes and turned to stone
and now i'm living all alone in these four walls

there's a stranger, he's lying in my bed
kinda blank like the thoughts living in my head
this is the one that i felt i knew so well
i think we had it, but we lost it
still the girl that you chased all around the world
i haven't changed, just replaced all the chains with pearls
i want the same things we did back then
i know we had it, but we lost it

oh, the bone breaks

when you hear the sirens coming

i wanna turn those blue lights
what have you done
into strobe lights
there's no need to run
not blue flashing lights
if you've done nothing wrong
maybe fairy lights
blue lights should just pass you by

gun crime into your right ear
drugs and violence into your left
default white headphones flooding the auditory
subconscious waves you accept
you're sitting on the 4 back home
"where you at, g? answer your phone "
pause the poison to answer his message
your boy sounds rushed, fears for his adolescence

i wanna turn those blue lights
what have you done
into strobe lights
there's no need to run
not blue flashing lights
if you've done nothing wrong
maybe fairy lights
blue lights should just pass you by

tall black shadow as you're getting off the bus
shadow shows no emotion so what's even the fuss?
but the face of your boy casts a darker picture
of the red handed act, he's gonna whisper;
"look blud i'm sorry 'cause i know you got my back
he was running, i couldn't think, i had to get out of that"
not long ago you were miming to the "shook ones"
now this really is part two 'cause you're the shook one
hands you the tool as you question your friendship
how's man like you gonna make me a convict?
level of a felon when i've done nothing wrong
blood on my hands but i don't know where it's from, oh
you got blood on your hands but you don't know where it's from

you better run when you hear the sirens coming
when you hear the sirens coming
better run when you hear the sirens coming
'cause they will be coming for you
run when you hear the sirens coming
better run when you hear the sirens coming
when you hear the sirens coming
the blue lights are coming for you

i wanna turn those blue lights
what have you done
into strobe lights
there's no need to run
not blue flashing lights
if you've done nothing wrong
maybe fairy lights
blue lights should just pass you by

"blud, when you hear the sirens coming"
don't you run when you hear the sirens coming
"blud, when you hear the sirens coming"
don't you run when you hear the sirens coming
what have you d d d done done

yet i know that their goal is to keep me from falling
but nothing's greater than the risk
that comes with your embrace
and in this world of loneliness, i see your face
yet everyone around me thinks that i'm going crazy
maybe, maybe

but i don't care what they say, i'm in love with you
they try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth

to say what's on my mind
i'm sorry i have to
baby, baby

we were friends, but with time
what i feel, deep inside
for you, has changed
but i'd give, up on love
if i thought, that it was
untrue, for you

if i told you that
i wanted to see you
and if i told you that
i beg to please you
if i told you that
i'll always keep you

to bring something in, ooh yeah
baby, baby
i hope it won't offend
the trust we have 'cause i
don't want this to end
no no no, baby

if you think we will lose what we have
then i'd just rather stay the same
because i don't want to choose
between two of the most precious things to me

if i told you that
i wanted to see you
and if i told you that
i beg to please you
if i told you that
i'll always keep you
what would you say
if i told you that

if we take this chance and extend
to each other romance
i hope it would be
the right thing for you and me

if i told you that
i wanted to see you
and if i told you that
i beg to please you
if i told you that
i'll always keep you
what would you say
if i told you that

if i told you that
i wanted to see you
and if i told you that
i beg to please you
if i told you that
i'll always keep you
what would you say
if i told you that

be there for me

feelings leave me
lonely
if i told you

if i told you that
i wanted to see you
and if i told you that

express disappointment
speak your regrets, yeah
oh, baby, call out my name

step down to my heart and mend this broken
if only you'd wake up from your constant possum playing
if only you'd wake up
i'm begging you sugar, have some leniency
call the president and ask him, baby
to pardon me and bring you back to me

and lord knows that this love has taken toll
i've given all of my love to this broken home

the same stains that were left from the cherry wine
the same stains that i wish we could both rewind

did you notice that the feeling ain't never gone?
did you notice it's the feeling you've been running from?
you wouldn't notice if your eyes ain't falling for me?
did you open up my heart, just to take it from me?

so why don't you lose yourself for me?
so why don't you lose yourself for me?
what is it that your eyes don't see?
why don't you lose yourself for me?
why don't you lose yourself for me?
why don't you lose yourself for me?

i don't wanna be the girl who laughs the loudest
or the girl who never wants to be alone
i don't wanna be that call at four o'clock in the morning
cause i'm the only one you know in the world that won't be home

ah, the sun is blinding
i stayed up again
oh, i am finding
that's not the way i want my story to end

i'm safe
up high
nothing can touch me
but why do i feel this party's over?
no pain
inside
you're my protection
but how do i feel this good sober?

i don't wanna be the girl that has to fill the silence
the quiet scares me cause it screams the truth
please don't tell me that we had that conversation
i won't remember, save your breath, cause what's the use?

ah, the night is calling
and it whispers to me softly come and play
ah, i am falling
and if i let myself go i'm the only one to blame

i'm safe
up high
nothing can touch me
but why do i feel this party's over?  oh 
no pain
inside
you're like perfection
but how do i feel this good sober?

coming down, coming down, coming down
spinning round, spinning round, spinning round
looking for myself, sober
coming down, coming down, coming down
spinning round, spinning round, spinning round
looking for myself, sober

when it's good, then it's good, it's so good 'till it goes bad
'till you're trying to find the you that you once had
i have heard myself cry, never again
broken down in agony just trying to find a friend
oh, oh

i'm safe
up high
nothing can touch me  nothing can touch me 
but why do i feel this party's over?  why do i feel this party's over? 
no pain  no 
inside  no 
you're like perfection
but how do i feel this good sober?  how do i feel this good sober? 
i'm safe
 no pain 
up high
nothing can touch me
but why do i feel this party's over?  oh 
no pain
inside
you're like perfection
but how do i feel this good sober?  how do i feel this good sober? 


seems like just yesterday
you were a part of me
i used to stand so tall
i used to be so strong
your arms around me tight
everything, it felt so right
unbreakable, like nothing could go wrong

now i can't breathe
no, i can't sleep
i'm barely hanging on

here i am, once again
i'm torn into pieces
can't deny it, can't pretend
just thought you were the one
broken up, deep inside
but you won't get to see the tears i cry
behind these hazel eyes

i told you everything
opened up and let you in
you made me feel alright
for once in my life
now all that's left of me
is what i pretend to be
so together, but so broken up inside

'cause i can't breathe
no, i can't sleep
i'm barely hanging on

here i am, once again
i'm torn into pieces
can't deny it, can't pretend
just thought you were the one
broken up, deep inside
but you won't get to see the tears i cry
behind these hazel eyes

swallow me then spit me out
for hating you, i blame myself
seeing you, it kills me now
no, i don't cry on the outside
anymore
anymore

here i am, once again
i'm torn into pieces
can't deny it, can't pretend
just thought you were the one
broken up, deep inside
but you won't get to see the tears i cry
behind these hazel eyes

here i am, once again
i'm torn into pieces
can't deny it, can't pretend
just thought you were the one
broken up, deep inside
but you won't get to see the tears i cry
behind these hazel eyes

all because, baby, i love you

didn't know it but i know it now
there's an angel living in my house
it's the only thing that could explain what i've been going through
i'm on fire over you
i've been reaching for the stars
i've been wearing my lucky charm
it's the only thing that could explain what i've been going through
i'm on fire over you
i'm wearing, i'm wearing my lucky charm

 pick up, i'm calling, calling

cold, 'cause she has been here before
she doesn t cry anymore, no looking back
no, she doesn't go to the bar
too many lovers she's scarred, and they want her back

she loves control, she wants it her way
and there's no way she'll ever stay unless you give it up
 give it up 
she loves control, she wants it her way
and all it takes is just one taste, you wanna give it up

bold, you know she lives for the thrill
you know she lusts for the kill, so they won't come back
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

'cause she loves control, she wants it her way
and there's no way she'll ever stay unless you give it up

a little bit of loving
a little bit of something from you

oh
if it's time to make your spouse feel good
i make sure that you got all your plans done right
'cause i'm not sure
if she was right
that i don't really know what they can tell me
about our love so special
what do they know about our flavor?
tell me if it's real so i don't slap myself
'cause there's no point in hidin'
i feel ignited with your love
it's so obvious, i'm sorry that it's pure
yeah yeah

i think i need a little bit of lovin'
a little bit of somethin'
i think i need a little bit of lovin'
a little bit of somethin' from you
woah, i think i need a little bit of lovin'
a little bit of somethin', yeah
'cause this love is all i have of you

if you like me now, wait 'til you get used to me

but it's all that we made

i think i need a little bit of lovin'
a little bit of somethin'
i think i need a little bit of lovin'
a little bit of somethin' from you
woah, i think i need a little bit of lovin'
a little bit of somethin', yeah  just a little bit, just a little bit 
'cause this love is all i have of you  yeah, yeah 


just gotta be me
so many voices

pj, you're not mainstream enough, yeah
would you consider us changing some stuff
like everything about who you are, ah
no offense, we're just trying to make you a star

but i must admit, i'm claustrophobic
i have a hard time trying to fit into your small mind
and i have a habit of dreaming bigger than anything
i can see right in front of me

pj, you're not quite street enough
thug life my nigga
act a little more tough
or, can you switch your style up a little more?
you can be yourself later, for now we need the radio

but i must admit, i'm claustrophobic
i have a hard time trying to fit into your small mind
and i have a habit of dreaming bigger than anything that
i can see right in front of me

can't see, the forest for the trees
the movement for the breeze
standing on my own feet
can't see, what you might want from me
think it's better if we be ourselves

they clutchin' to my talents more than catholics do a rosary
steady ask, where that accent traveled?
you from new orleans?
gold soul, why i dabble with negative energy
when all i really fiend is a posi sensibility
not the hardest rapper, but i'm 'bout it much as master p
don't play with me, 504 my home
don't you know that
flooding through the streets
you should probably take a kodak
photosynthesize sprouting right in front yo' eyes
made a trip to cali and came back a different guy
living through the same eyes, riding uber, still got drive
been the truest never lie and i need a little space
'cause i'm better doing me
just recite if you relate

i'm claustrophobic
i have a hard time to fit into your small mind
and i have a habit of dreaming bigger than anything
i can see right in front of me

another man, just gotta be you
i think that the thing makes us unique
it's our differences with our treasures
somebody always tryna make you fit in a box
and never seen again, don't think it's possible

no new year's day to celebrate
no chocolate covered candy hearts to give away
no first of spring, no song to sing
in fact here's just another ordinary day

no april rain, no flowers bloom
no wedding saturday within the month of june
but what it is is something new
made up of these three words i say to you

i just called to say i love you
i just called to say how much i care
i just called to say i love you
and i mean it from the bottom of my heart

no summer's high
no warm july
no harvest moon to light one tender august night
no autumn breeze
no falling leaves
not even time for birds to fly to southern skies
no libra sun
no halloween
no giving thanks to all the christmas joy you bring
but what it is, though old so new
to fill your heart like no three words could ever do

i just called to say i love you
i just called to say how much i care
i just called to say i love you
and i mean it from the bottom of my heart

i just called to say i love you
i just called to say how much i care
i just called to say i love you
and i mean it from the bottom of my heart


la da da da da, la da da da da
da da da

we are searchlights, we can see in the dark
we are rockets, pointed up at the stars
we are billions of beautiful hearts
and you sold us down the river too far

what about us?
what about all the times you said you had the answers?
what about us?
what about all the broken happy ever afters?
what about us?
what about all the plans that ended in disaster?
what about love? what about trust?
what about us?

we are problems that want to be solved
we are children that need to be loved
we were willin', we came when you called
but man, you fooled us, enough is enough, oh

what about us?
what about all the times you said you had the answers?
what about us?
what about all the broken happy ever afters?

sticks and stones, they may break these bones
but then i'll be ready, are you ready?
it's the start of us, waking up come on
are you ready? i'll be ready
i don't want control, i want to let go
are you ready? i'll be ready
'cause now it's time to let them know
we are ready, what about us?

yendo m s despacio
nunca aprend  a frenar
ni a volar m s alto
no pas  de tu portal
vest as de luto
cuando bailas frenes 
esto no ha acabado
no ha llegado a su fin
perd  la fama en un cabaret
se han olvidado a qu  huele la luna
y en las cantinas, c mo bailan, c mo cantan
se han olvidado a qu  huela la luna
el d a es claro, ha salido solo
te han entrado ganas de bebertelo todo
crees que cuando bailas no se esconde el miedo
y sobre su cuello flotan los pa uelos
solo hace falta que demos la vuelta
recapitulemos, paguemos a medias
mi sobredosis siempre ser n tus piernas
que beben del metal que hay en tus venas
y en las cantinas, c mo bailan, c mo cantan
se han olvidado a que huele la luna
y en las cantinas, c mo r en, c mo bailan
se han olvidado a que huele la luna
el d a es raro
ni te echo de menos
podr a tocarle a cualquiera diez boleros
todo se acaba, dijiste mirando
no pasa nada, nos vamos de aqui
a casa de dron

there you go, looking pitiful
just because i let you go
there you go, talking 'bout you want me back
but sometimes it be's like that, so
there you go, talking 'bout you miss me so, that you love me so, why i let you go
there you go because your lies got old
look at you, there you go

please don't come around talking about how you changed
how you said good bye to what's her name
all it sounds like to me is new game
and i was right when i thought i'd be much better off without you
had to get myself from 'round you, because my life was all about you
so you say you wanna talk, i don't
say you wanna change, i won't
yeah, it's like that
had your chance, won't take you back
now what, what you think about that?
and when i say i'm through, i'm through
basically i'm through with you
what you wanna say
had to have it your way, had to play games, now you're begging me to stay

i wish i could tie you up in my shoes
make you feel unpretty too
i was told i was beautiful
but what does that mean to you?
look into the mirror, who's inside there
the one with the long hair
same old me again today, yeah

my outsides look cool
my insides are blue
everytime i think i'm through
it's because of you
i try different ways
but it's all the same
at the end of the day
i have myself to blame
i'm just trippin'

you can buy your hair if it won't grow
you can fix your nose if he says so
you can buy all the make up
that m.a.c. can make, but if
you can't look inside you
find out who am i to
be in the position that make me feel
so damn unpretty
i'll make you feel unpretty too

never insecure until i met you
now i'm bein' stupid
i used to be so cute to me
just a little bit skinny
why do i look to all these things
to keep you happy?
maybe get rid of you
and then i'll get back to me, yeah

my outsides look cool
my insides are blue
everytime i think i'm through
it's because of you
i try different ways
but it's all the same
at the end of the day
i have myself to blame

where there is desire
there is gonna be a flame
where there is a flame
someone's bound to get burned
but just because it burns
doesn't mean you're gonna die
you've gotta get up and try try try
gotta get up and try try try
you gotta get up and try try try

eh, eh, eh

funny how the heart can be deceiving
more than just a couple times
why do we fall in love so easy
even when it's not right

where there is desire
there is gonna be a flame
where there is a flame
someone's bound to get burned
but just because it burns
doesn't mean you're gonna die
you've gotta get up and try try try
gotta get up and try try try
you gotta get up and try try try

ever worried that it might be ruined
and does it make you wanna cry?
when you're out there doing what you're doing
are you just getting by?
tell me are you just getting by by by

where there is desire
there is gonna be a flame
where there is a flame
someone's bound to get burned
but just because it burns
doesn't mean you're gonna die
you've gotta get up and try try try
gotta get up and try try try
you gotta get up and try try try

and then you bite your lip, whisper and say
"we re going all the way"

so tonight, kiss me like it's do or die
and take me to the other side

but we won't know unless we try  try 
i know you're nervous
so just sit back and let me drive

tonight we'll just get drunk, disturb the peace
bind your hands all over me
and then you bite your lip, whisper and say
"we re going all the way"

once i was happy
once i was alive
with the spirit of life's beauty
and a limit of the sky
watching lives get taken
made something in me die
every day is a struggle for my spirit to survive
somehow i lost the will to be
cause my soul simply crept outside of me
somebody tell me where'd it go
searchin' for my soul
thought it was stayin' but now i don't
searchin' for my soul
it left an empty space you know
searchin' for my soul
if you should see it send it home
i tried to be strong but my strength is skin deep
if happiness is comin' i hope i have the vision to see
i'm so heavy hearted
i've got billie's blues
lately i can't even bring myself to watch the news
oh i feel the weight of all the world
is resting on the shoulders of this girl
chorus
every time one of us goes down
it's like i'm looking at my own blood on the ground
seems like everybody's lost their minds
and i just might be the next one in line
chorus
searchin' for my soul
searchin' for, searchin' for, searchin' for my soul
repeat

like, like if my currency dry out, would you be out thirsty?
would your mind want me, like your soul want me?
when i go down on you, i drown for quarter centuries
you a whole globe, you a whole earth
and i'm a troubled millionaire that fears you know your worth
absence makes the heart grow fonder so we ponder
on the things we gon' do when distance ain't a problem
our intentions, they was honest, we was cordial, we was talkin'
we was hidin', there was no one, we was lyin', it was fuckin'
foreplay with your body divided now
it's forehead kisses before my flight departed, that
showed me the feelings, about to play with that
three days away, three hours back, hold on

can't be without you, baby
ain't got no voice
where my phone? who got my phone? you got my phone?
she called me, hold on man
 you have reach the voicemail box 
hol' up

just got off the stage, know you sleepin', but wait
just lost my voice for this crowd i only seen your face in everywhere, but these women real as a fairy tale
can barely talk but you hit my line, i'ma hear you well
i need that vibe from you 'cause spendin' time on this bus
take the power from my brain, in between your thighs they should rest
we alive, we in love, we can die if we don't
if monogamy you want then share your time with pornhub  ha  
i'm just playin', just need you know i'm lonely
green tea, ricola and honey gold
we missin' each other more so we horny or don't speak
three hours apart, cool, two days and you seein' me
my vocals is now shot, call up doctor, steroid me
we cortisone 'til my quarter zone is back as your toy please
i know you don't need nothin' but what i got
two days away, three hours back, goodnight

 can't be without you, baby 
we one tomorrow away from celebratin' that that very tomorrow's the day  not even for a night 
i know it's late but i'ma hit you later
 and so i been thinking lately of being with you for all time 

i'm on the way, you know
once you know my voice back
'cause see like a hunnid forevers plus a day since i last seen the livin' embodiment of my forever
face to face and i might just inject your body with knowledge
your body with style, you'll be flyer than rox brown
okay, i'm lyin', nobody flyin' than rox
but i might just get in a half squat position and proposition you with a shiny rock under an open box
so the onlookers can understand that we all official
we all just kids lookin' for the first love we ever injected
so whenever i'm never next to you, i never look to the next woman even on her best moment to bestowed
a stove you kept warm for me, as i kept distance you kept cookin'
sugar, we went from three days and three hours 'til we two days and three hours to, "girl he think he darius lovehall, he walkin' down the street writin' poetry to make the between yo' knees feel like you need balance"
and i see you alot but i see you on camera so it seem like a lie when i say i need to see us together
from three days to two days, from two days to today
from today to tonight, from tonight to forever, i'm up the street

crawling through a systematic maze to demise
pain in our eyes
strain of drownin', wading through the lies
degradation so loud that you can't hear the sound of our cries  doo, doo 
all the dreamers have gone to the side of the road which we relay on
inundated by media, virtual mind fucks in streams

all we wanted was a chance to talk
'stead we only got outlined in chalk
feet have bled a million miles we've walked
revealing at the end of the day, the charade

perpetrators beware say a prayer if you dare for the believers
with a faith at the size of a seed enough to be redeemed  doo doo 
relegated to savages bound by the way of the deceivers
so anchors be sure that you're sure we ain't no amateurs

all we wanted was a chance to talk
'stead we only got outlined in chalk
feet have bled a million miles we've walked
revealing at the end of the day, the charade

with the veil off our eyes we'll truly see
and we'll march on
and it really won't take too long
and it really won't take us very long

revealing at the end of the day, the charade
all we wanted was a chance to talk
'stead we only got outlined in chalk
'stead we only got outlined in chalk
revealing at the end of the day, the charade
all we wanted was a chance to talk
revealing at the end of the day, the charade
all we wanted was a  the charade 


maybe this fate was overdue

can't teach yourself to be sincere

how did i fall? got lost in the moonlight
where did i go? when did i realize
my love was on hold? so now this is goodbye
good, goodbye, goodbye

this time my questions lay with you
 lay with you, lay with you 
'cause each time inside i play the fool
 played the fool, play the fool 
silly boy, where did that man go?
the one that hurt my soul
 the one that hurt my soul 
now little man, i left you on your own
with the whispers on your phone
i've been askin' all along
 asking all along 

where did i go?  where did i go?  when did the sun rise?  when did the sun rise? 
how did i fall?  how did i fall?  got lost in the moonlight  lost in the moonlight

six years old
staring at my nose in the mirror
trying to dip my toes in the mirror
thinking 'who's that girl?'
and 'does the mirror world go on forever?'
carmenia road
sharpening the knives in the attic
trying to watch cartoons through the static
thinking where am i gonna be
if i'm ever twenty three? oh

dreaming of the green and gold
just like the ancient stone
every sunrise i know
those eyes you gave to me
that let me see
where i come from

found an old friend
meeting my guitar in the city
feeling like a star in the city
and suddenly it seems that i'm where i'm supposed to be, oh
and now i'm fully grown
and i'm seeing everything clearer
just sweep away the dust from the mirror
we're walking hand in hand on the warm white sands

dreaming of the green and gold
just like the ancient stone
every sunrise i know

ms. third ward, your first question:
what is your aspiration in life?
oh, well my aspiration in life would be... to be happy

mama said, "you're a pretty girl
what's in your head, it doesn't matter
brush your hair, fix your teeth
what you wear is all that matters"

just another stage
pageant the pain away
this time i'm gonna take the crown
without falling down, down, down

pretty hurts
we shine the light on whatever's worst
perfection is a disease of a nation
pretty hurts, pretty hurts
pretty hurts
we shine the light on whatever's worst
tryna fix something
but you can't fix what you can't see
it's the soul that needs a surgery

blonder hair, flat chest
tv says bigger is better
south beach, sugar free
vogue says thinner is better

just another stage, pageant the pain away
this time i'm gonna take the crown
without falling down, down, down

pretty hurts
we shine the light on whatever's worst
perfection is a disease of a nation
pretty hurts, pretty hurts
pretty hurts
we shine the light on whatever's worst
we try to fix something
but you can't fix what you can't see
it's the soul that needs the surgery

ain t got no doctor or pill that can take the pain away
the pain's inside and nobody frees you from your body
it's the soul, its the soul that needs surgery
 it's my soul that needs surgery 
plastic smiles and denial can only take you so far
then you break when the fake fa ade leaves you in the dark
you left with shattered mirrors and the shards of a beautiful past

pretty hurts
we shine the light on whatever's worst
perfection is a disease of a nation
pretty hurts, pretty hurts
pretty hurts
we shine the light on whatever's worst
tryna fix something
but you can't fix what you can't see
it's the soul that needs a surgery

when you're alone all by yourself
and you're lying in your bed
reflection stares right into you
are you happy with yourself?
you stripped away the masquerade
the illusion has been shed
are you happy with yourself?
are you happy with yourself?
yeah, yes  ah, ah, ah

 that was the hardest time of my life 
so much better now

closed off from love, i didn't need the pain
once or twice was enough and it was all in vain
time starts to pass, before you know it you're frozen
but something happened for the very first time with you
my heart melted to the ground
found something true
and everyone's looking round thinking i'm going crazy

but i don't care what they say, i'm in love with you
they try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth
my heart's crippled by the vein that i keep on closing
you cut me open and i

keep bleeding
keep, keep bleeding love
i keep bleeding
i keep, keep bleeding love
keep bleeding
keep, keep bleeding love
you cut me open

trying hard not to hear, but they talk so loud
their piercing sounds fill my ears, try to fill me with doubt
yet i know that their goal is to keep me from falling
but nothing's greater than the risk
that comes with your embrace
and in this world of loneliness, i see your face
yet everyone around me thinks that i'm going crazy
maybe, maybe

but i don't care what they say, i'm in love with you
they try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth
my heart's crippled by the vein that i keep on closing
you cut me open and i

keep bleeding
keep, keep bleeding love
i keep bleeding
i keep, keep bleeding love
keep bleeding
keep, keep bleeding love
you cut me open

and it's draining all of me
though they find it hard to believe
i'll be wearing these scars for everyone to see

but i don't care what they say, i'm in love with you
they try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth
my heart's crippled by the vein that i keep on closing
you cut me open and i

keep bleeding
keep, keep bleeding love
i keep bleeding
i keep, keep bleeding love
keep bleeding
keep, keep bleeding love
 ooh, you cut me open and i 
keep bleeding
keep, keep bleeding love
i keep bleeding
i keep, keep bleeding love
keep bleeding
keep, keep bleeding love

ooh, you cut me open and i
keep bleeding
keep, keep bleeding love


yeah like that, sounds cool

can a man be so blind that this vision can't be mine?
'cause the shore won't draw the line when water rising with the tide
and for once, i am drifting, but not on my own
and now i'm right where i shoulda been, here with you all along

i've been meaning to leave
all those nights, i was weak
i gave up while you held it down
you're still here, but i know
that your heart's getting cold
i'm holding tight, it's getting real now

'cause i can't lose
'cause i care for you
i can't lose you
i care for you
i care for you
i care for you

so it turns out, i don't ask for help
and you don't wanna open up
and when you see my tears right now
you want me to clean 'em up
all these hateful words, using them to stab me
even though it hurts, you can throw 'em at me, baby
it takes a man to admit he messed up
but girl, you gotta be fair

'cause i can't lose

stop blaming me
he wasn't man enough for me

do you know he begged to stay with me?
he wasn't man enough for me

listen, girl
didn't he tell you the truth?
if not then why don't you ask him?
then maybe you can be more into him
instead of worryin' about me
and hopefully you won't find
all of the reasons why his love didn't count
and why we couldn't work it out

when i just wanted to get some attention  sorry 
and i'm sorry, baby for bitching
if i could take back the words
that i said to make you leave
i'd be down on bended knees

you speak in dictionaries while fearing less than all will understand
virgo moon, i'm so used to your dance
tongue too swole to comprehend
i see you duck and dodge at every bend
afraid to play your card, be forced to show your hand
i hope you take from this that it'll make you no less of a man
to break your walls and simply grab my hand
love shouldn't be contraband
it shouldn't trample on your confidence
shouldn't be seen as less than compliments


it's not about the physical manifestation of sex. now we deal with the freak n. but that's in volume two  first, i'm tryna get the woman to understand the dynamic power and the spiritual energy. do you realize how magnificent you are? the god that created you is a divine architect that created the moon, the sun, the stars, jupiter, mars, pluto, venus. we are not only sexual beings, we are the walking embodiment of god consciousness


 love me, love me, love me, love me 
if it were possible to place you in my brain and let you roam around, in and out my thought waves, you would never have to ask, "why do you love me?"

please take the wheel forever
with you i feel forever
show me the way to never
down where you'll stay forever

if i were a boy
even just for a day
i'd roll out of bed in the morning
and throw on what i wanted and go
drink beer with the guys
and chase after girls
i'd kick it with who i wanted
and i'd never get confronted for it
'cause they'd stick up for me

if i were a boy
i think i could understand
how it feels to love a girl
i swear i'd be a better man
i'd listen to her
'cause i know how it hurts
when you lose the one you wanted
'cause he's taken you for granted
and everything you had got destroyed

if i were a boy
i would turn off my phone
tell everyone it's broken
so they'd think that i was sleepin' alone
i'd put myself first
and make the rules as i go
'cause i'd know that she'd be faithful
waitin' for me to come home
to come home

if i were a boy
i think i could understand
how it feels to love a girl
i swear i'd be a better man
i'd listen to her
'cause i know how it hurts
when you lose the one you wanted  wanted 
'cause he's taken you for granted  granted 
and everything you had got destroyed

it's a little too late for you to come back
say, it's just a mistake
think i'd forgive you like that
if you thought i would wait for you
you thought wrong

but you're just a boy
you don't understand
 yeah, you don't understand, oh 
how it feels to love a girl
someday, you'll wish you were a better man
you don't listen to her
you don't care how it hurts
until you lose the one you wanted
'cause you've taken her for granted
and everything you have got destroyed
but you're just a boy...

where niggas either do or they gon' die

someone murdered
nobody seen, nobody heard it

police stay on us like tattoos
niggas only grind 'cause we have to
money is power
sling crack, weed, and powder
fiends come through every hour

and we no deal with cowards
weak lamb get devoured
by the lion in the concrete jungle
the strong stand and rumble
the weak fold and crumble

don't come through if niggas don't know you
'cause people is talking
the streets is watching
the d's is lurking
stash the nine in the garbage
the life of a hustler
the life of a gambler
dice game, kill more niggas than cancer

depending on my mood or my attitude
sometimes i wanna roll or stay at home
walking contradiction, guess i m factual and fiction

little rough around the edges but i keep it smooth
i m always left of center and that s right where i belong

take a different type of girl to keep the whole world afloat

'cause i m crazy and i m sexy then i m cool
little rough around the edges but i keep it smooth
i m always left of center and that s right where i belong

right before mr. ammond s class
'cause my mama couldn t afford new js
polos, thrift store, thrift clothes that was all i knew
do you remember?

there's a hero
if you look inside your heart
you don't have to be afraid
of what you are
there s an answer
if you reach into your soul
and the sorrow that you know
will melt away

and then a hero comes along
with the strength to carry on
and you cast your fears aside
and you know you can survive
so when you feel like hope is gone
look inside you and be strong
and you'll finally see the truth
that a hero lies in you

it's a long road
when you face the world alone
no one reaches out a hand for you to hold
you can find love
if you search within yourself
and the emptiness you felt
will disappear

and then a hero comes along
with the strength to carry on
and you cast your fears aside
and you know you can survive
so when you feel like hope is gone
look inside you and be strong
and you'll finally see the truth
that a hero lies in you

lord knows
dreams are hard to follow
but don't let anyone
tear them away
hold on

in time
you'll find the way

and then a hero comes along
with the strength to carry on
and you cast your fears aside
and you know you can survive
so when you feel like hope is gone
look inside you and be strong
and you'll finally see the truth
that a hero lies in you

if i were a boy
even just for a day
i'd roll out of bed in the morning
and throw on what i wanted and go
drink beer with the guys
and chase after girls
i'd kick it with who i wanted
and i'd never get confronted for it
'cause they'd stick up for me

if i were a boy
i think i could understand
how it feels to love a girl
i swear i'd be a better man
i'd listen to her
'cause i know how it hurts
when you lose the one you wanted
'cause he's taken you for granted
and everything you had got destroyed

if i were a boy
i would turn off my phone
tell everyone it's broken
so they'd think that i was sleepin' alone
i'd put myself first
and make the rules as i go
'cause i'd know that she'd be faithful
waitin' for me to come home
to come home

if i were a boy
i think i could understand
how it feels to love a girl
i swear i'd be a better man
i'd listen to her
'cause i know how it hurts
when you lose the one you wanted  wanted 
'cause he's taken you for granted  granted 
and everything you had got destroyed

it's a little too late for you to come back
say, it's just a mistake
think i'd forgive you like that
if you thought i would wait for you
you thought wrong

but you're just a boy
you don't understand
 yeah, you don't understand, oh 
how it feels to love a girl
someday, you'll wish you were a better man
you don't listen to her
you don't care how it hurts
until you lose the one you wanted
'cause you've taken her for granted
and everything you have got destroyed
but you're just a boy...


you're everything i thought you never were
and nothing like i thought you could've been
but still ,you live inside of me
so tell me how is that?
you're the only one i wish i could forget
the only one i'd love to not forgive
and though you break my heart, you're the only one
and though there are times when i hate you
'cause i can't erase
the times that you hurt me
and put tears on my face
and even now while i hate you
it pains me to say
i know i'll be there at the end of the day

i don't wanna be without you, babe
i don't want a broken heart
don't wanna take a breath with out you, babe
i don't wanna play that part
i know that i love you
but let me just say

dirty tissues, trust issues
glasses on the sink, they didn't fix you
lonely pillows in a stranger's bed
little voices in my head
secret keeping, stop the bleeding
lost a little weight because i wasn't eating
all the souls that i can't listen to, to tell the truth

loving you was young, and wild, and free
loving you was cool, and hot, and sweet
loving you was sunshine, safe and sound
a steady place to let down my defenses
but loving you had consequences

hesitation, awkward conversation
running on low expectation
every siren that i was ignoring
i'm paying for it

loving you was young, and wild, and free
loving you was cool, and hot, and sweet
loving you was sunshine, safe and sound
a steady place to let down my defenses
but loving you had consequences

no, ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
said no, ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
i, no, ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh, mhm

loving you was dumb, dark, and cheap
loving you will still take shots at me
from loving you was sunshine, but then it poured
and i lost so much more than my senses
'cause loving you had consequences
loving you

a lonely mother gazing out of the window
staring at a son that she just can't touch
if at any time he's in a jam, she'll be by his side
but he doesn't realize he hurts her so much
but all the praying just ain't helping at all
cause he can't seem to keep his self out of trouble
so he goes out and he makes his money the best way he knows how
another body laying cold in the gutter
listen to me

don't go chasing waterfalls
please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
i know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
but i think you're moving too fast

little precious has a natural obsession for temptation
but he just can't see
she gives him loving that his body can't handle
but all he can say is, "baby it's good to me"
one day he goes and takes a glimpse in the mirror
but he doesn't recognize his own face
his health is fading and he doesn't know why
three letters took him to his final resting place
y'all, don't hear me

don't go chasing waterfalls
please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
i know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
but i think you're moving too fast
don't go chasing waterfalls
please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
i know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
but i think you're moving too fast

come on 
i seen a rainbow yesterday, but too many storms
have come and gone, leaving a trace of not one god given ray
is it because my life is ten shades of gray, i pray
all ten fade away, seldom praise him for the sunny days
and like his promise is true, only my faith can undo
the many chances i blew to bring my life to anew
clear and blue and unconditional skies
have dried the tears from my eyes, no more lonely cries
my only bleeding hope is for the folk who can't cope
with such an endurin pain that it keeps 'em in the pourin rain
who's to blame for tooting 'caine into your own vein
what a shame, you shoot and aim for someone else's brain
you claim the insane, and name this day in time
for falling prey to crime
i say the system's got you victim to your own mind
dreams are hopeless aspirations in hopes of coming true
believe in yourself, the rest is up to me and you

don't go chasing waterfalls
please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
i know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
but i think you're moving too fast
don't go chasing waterfalls
please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
i know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
but i think you're moving too fast

wait, my train won't leave for a minute
no connection delays my departure from you
hesitating, come fall at the doors if you feel it
'cause we're running out of time, there's fine lines to be drawn

i see you smiling as you're talking on the phone
hiding your messages, but i already know that
i'm not a part of your game

it ain't right what you're doing to me
it ain't right, you're confusing me
which side of the fine lines do you want me?
it ain't right what you're doing to me
can't you see you're confusing me?
which side of the fine line's for you and me?

calling coins will go, but you are still on my mind
validate your intentions, you won't be fine
on the other hand, you're charging world
maybe you'll move in single file
'cause i'm losing my mind, there's fine lines to be drawn

and i believed me when i said that i would row
snakes on the ladders, so i guess it's down we go
i've had enough of your games

it ain't right what you're doing to me
it ain't right, you're confusing me
which side of the fine lines do you want me?
it ain't right what you're doing to me
can't you see you're confusing me?
which side of the fine line's for you and me?

the doors are closing, so is this our last goodbye?
final curtain call before the whistle blows
tells us why i've got to leave, i've got to go
i don't want to leave, don't want to go
but it's true 'cause we both know

it ain't right what you're doing to me
it ain't right, you're confusing me
which side of the fine lines do you want me?
it ain't right what you're doing to me
can't you see you're confusing me?
which side of the fine line's for you and me?
it ain't right what you're doing to me
it ain't right, you're confusing me
which side of the fine lines do you want me?

it ain't right, now you can see
which side of the fine line's for you and me?

it's only me
i've come to see you
and i know
what you've been through
i will be your friend
lean on me for now
got to pull you back up
somehow
and i'll have no more of this moping around
i'm tired of you putting yourself down
'cause in spite of all you've been through
i still believe
there's a winner in you
sometimes you can see it
on the tip of your mind
but can't focus in on time
then the wind takes it to another
before you discover
there's a winner
there's a hero
there's a lover too
somewhere there's a winner in you
i'll have no more of this moping around
i'm tired of you putting yourself down
'cause in spite of all you've been through
i still believe
there's a winner in you
there's a winner
there's a hero
there's a lover too
somewhere there's a winner in you
there's a winner
there's a hero
there's a lover too
somewhere there's a winner in you


i am unwritten, can't read my mind, i'm undefined
i'm just beginning, the pen's in my hand
ending unplanned

staring at the blank page before you
open up the dirty window
let the sun illuminate the words that you cannot find
reaching for something in the distance
so close you can almost taste it
release your inhibitions

feel the rain on your skin
no one else can feel it for you
only you can let it in
no one else, no one else
can speak the words on your lips
drench yourself in words unspoken
live your life with arms wide open
today is where your book begins
the rest is still unwritten

sometimes my tries, are outside the lines
we've been conditioned to not make mistakes
but i can't live that way, no

ahora que ya mi vida se encuentra normal
que tengo en casa quien sue a con verme llegar
ahora puedo decir que me encuentro de pie
ahora que me va muy bien
ahora que con el tiempo logr  superar
aquel amor que por poco me llega a matar, no
ahora ya no hay mas dolor
ahora al fin vuelvo a ser yo

pero me acuerdo de ti
y otra vez pierdo la calma
pero me acuerdo de ti
y se me desgarra el alma
pero me acuerdo de ti
y se borra mi sonrisa
pero me acuerdo de ti
y mi mundo se hace trizas

ahora que mi futuro comienza a brillar
ahora que me han devuelto la seguridad
ahora ya no hay mas dolor
ahora al fin vuelvo a ser yo

pero me acuerdo de ti
y otra vez pierdo la calma
pero me acuerdo de ti
y se me desgarra el alma
pero me acuerdo de ti
y se borra mi sonrisa
pero me acuerdo de ti
y mi mundo se hace trizas

mi sonrisa

oh pero me, pero me, pero me
pero me acuerdo de ti
pero me acuerdo de ti
pero me acuerdo de ti

three little words over time overheard and overused, used
no sweet nothing could ever be turned into something new
no grand gesture could ever be made to measure you

closed off from love, i didn't need the pain
once or twice was enough and it was all in vain
time starts to pass, before you know it you're frozen
but something happened for the very first time with you
my heart melted to the ground
found something true
and everyone's looking round thinking i'm going crazy

but i don't care what they say, i'm in love with you
they try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth
my heart's crippled by the vein that i keep on closing
you cut me open and i

keep bleeding
keep, keep bleeding love
i keep bleeding
i keep, keep bleeding love
keep bleeding
keep, keep bleeding love
you cut me open

trying hard not to hear, but they talk so loud
their piercing sounds fill my ears, try to fill me with doubt
yet i know that their goal is to keep me from falling
but nothing's greater than the risk
that comes with your embrace
and in this world of loneliness, i see your face
yet everyone around me thinks that i'm going crazy
maybe, maybe

but i don't care what they say, i'm in love with you
they try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth
my heart's crippled by the vein that i keep on closing
you cut me open and i

keep bleeding
keep, keep bleeding love
i keep bleeding
i keep, keep bleeding love
keep bleeding
keep, keep bleeding love
you cut me open

and it's draining all of me
though they find it hard to believe
i'll be wearing these scars for everyone to see

but i don't care what they say, i'm in love with you
they try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth
my heart's crippled by the vein that i keep on closing
you cut me open and i

keep bleeding
keep, keep bleeding love
i keep bleeding
i keep, keep bleeding love
keep bleeding
keep, keep bleeding love
 ooh, you cut me open and i

it's falling from my window
and in the corners of my mind
i hope that i'll get to see you again
la da di da di da di da di my friend
i hear the colors in the flowers
just like the candle snuffed at dawn
you're here, you're near, you're there and then you're gone
la da die da die da die da die

suffering in sinking sand
all the hurt
see, i'm really lost, baby
we suffered a rare, rare blue
so much hurt
on this earth
but you loved me
and i really dared to love you, too
perhaps what i mean to say is
is that it's amazing that your love was mine

oh, maker, tell me did you know
this love would burn so yellow?
becoming orange and, in its time
explode from grey to black then bloody wine
la da di da di da di da di
oh, maker, have you ever loved
or known just what it was?
i can't imagine the bitter end
of all the beauty that we're living in
oh, no

suffering in sinking sand
all the hurt
see, i'm really lost, baby
we suffered a rare, rare blue
so much hurt
on this earth
but you loved me
and i really dared to love you, too
perhaps what i mean to say is
is that it's amazing that your love was mine

lost inside a lonely world where lovers pay the price
barely get the sound of music to love and go dance to
now it's time for us to go and no one ever has to know
your love's in my pocket and your eyes, eyes are in my
eyes in my soul, no one will know it but me


so many things i'm going through
so much that i wanna do
it starting to become so clear to me

it takes such a load off to let you know
that you're the only one i never want to go
think i never did know what to do
a love i never felt, now i feel for you
why don't i just swallow each and every ounce of my pride
everything you do i wanna feel again

a lonely mother gazing out of the window
staring at a son that she just can't touch
if at any time he's in a jam, she'll be by his side
but he doesn't realize he hurts her so much
but all the praying just ain't helping at all
cause he can't seem to keep his self out of trouble
so he goes out and he makes his money the best way he knows how
another body laying cold in the gutter
listen to me

don't go chasing waterfalls
please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
i know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
but i think you're moving too fast

little precious has a natural obsession for temptation
but he just can't see
she gives him loving that his body can't handle
but all he can say is, "baby it's good to me"
one day he goes and takes a glimpse in the mirror
but he doesn't recognize his own face
his health is fading and he doesn't know why
three letters took him to his final resting place
y'all, don't hear me

don't go chasing waterfalls
please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
i know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
but i think you're moving too fast
don't go chasing waterfalls
please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
i know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
but i think you're moving too fast

come on 
i seen a rainbow yesterday, but too many storms
have come and gone, leaving a trace of not one god given ray
is it because my life is ten shades of gray, i pray
all ten fade away, seldom praise him for the sunny days
and like his promise is true, only my faith can undo
the many chances i blew to bring my life to anew
clear and blue and unconditional skies
have dried the tears from my eyes, no more lonely cries
my only bleeding hope is for the folk who can't cope
with such an endurin pain that it keeps 'em in the pourin rain
who's to blame for tooting 'caine into your own vein
what a shame, you shoot and aim for someone else's brain
you claim the insane, and name this day in time
for falling prey to crime
i say the system's got you victim to your own mind
dreams are hopeless aspirations in hopes of coming true
believe in yourself, the rest is up to me and you

don't go chasing waterfalls
please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
i know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
but i think you're moving too fast
don't go chasing waterfalls
please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
i know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
but i think you're moving too fast


i hear the drizzle of the rain
it's falling from my window
and in the corners of my mind
i hope that i'll get to see you again
la da di da di da di da di my friend

just like the candle snuffed at dawn
you're here, you're near, you're there and then you're gone

suffering in sinking sand
all the hurt
see, i'm really lost, baby
we suffered a rare, rare blue
so much hurt
on this earth
but you loved me
and i really dared to love you, too
perhaps what i mean to say is
is that it's amazing that your love was mine

oh, maker, tell me did you know

becoming orange and, in its time
explode from grey to black then bloody wine

it's all my fault, look in the mirror

seeing thing different, oh am i lost?
feelin' a way, nothing's the same
i wish you would change, oh i'm lost
numbin' the pain, don't make it okay

to my women with the utmost respect, intellect
we often forget and neglect intuition can see through elusive intent, listen to it
just listen, just listen, oh
i found myself searching for a way to prevent, the detriment
and giving the impression that if you express to him what a woman needs, his comprehension is definite
but there's a difference between understanding and honoring your word
and i'm articulate, he's a good listener but i'm hesitant 'cause he's gonna fuck up anyways  anyways, anyways, anyways 
baby just listen, listen, listen, oh, woah
and the corners of a man's mind is a place where vulnerability hides
and intimacy is not the act of physical intertwined but it's the isolation of two minds
that's why he keeps his heart and his head seperate
there's only one he can connect with
the multiple names on a checklist, only calls when he's desperate
i guess, it's too much pressure to be respectful and honest
it's too stressful to be keepin' promises and i'm impatient
i'm too high maintenance, way too many expectations when, we're just dating
but i'm special, right?
deny, deny, deny
all you do is lie, word is bond right?
but not with me because i don't know what it's like
i'll never understand the needs of a man or how to nurture
and what she doesn't know can't hurt her
but nah it's deep and you know it
i told you exactly what i wanted
and that love is exhausting but i'm not tired of you yet
oh, no, woah oh, no
to my women with the utmost respect, intellect
we often forget and neglect intuition can see through elusive intent, listen to it


i'm up, late night, my phone so dry
no goodnight, i'm tight 'cause i'm paranoid
i can't sleep you're still mad at me

and even though i really love you
i'm gonna smile 'cause i deserve to
it'll all get better in time

i couldn't turn on the tv
without something there to remind me
was it all that easy
to just put aside your feelings?

if i'm dreaming, don't wanna laugh
hurt my feelings, but that's the path
i believe in, and i know that time will heal it
if you didn't notice, boy, you meant everything

it's time i let you go so i can be free
and live my life how it should be  and i know, and i know 
no matter how hard it is, i'll be fine without you

you cannot blame if it don't mean nothing

sweet, sweet fate
i had about all i can take
am i living in the path that i make

can you forgive all of my sins?

how come, when i'm lookin' at everyone
they get away with havin' their fun
i'm paying these dues when they don't mean nothing

sweet, sweet fate
i had about all that can take
am i my living in the path that i make
is it yours? i wonder
sweet, sweet fate
 sweet, sweet fate 
oh if it's really out of my hands
 if it's really out of my hands 
can you forgive all of my sins?
 can you forgive all of my sins? 
have mercy on me, me

i was nothing but good to you
made some mistakes, but i still love you
i guess i couldn't do for you
the things you wanted me to
and when i said that i apologize
i meant every line i spoke
i couldn't do for you
the things you wanted me to
ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
guess i couldn't do for you
the things you wanted me to
but still, i'm here
tryna understand the way that you could let me in
and expect us to be perfect
but nothing that way's ever worth it
worth the fight, the fall
why would we not risk it all?
and when it's not perfect
you know that there's discernment
but tell you that somebody really loves you
and they're not here to play you
but you... couldn't see past my views
and when it came down to me and my wrongs
man, it hurt to know that i purchased them on my own
i was nothing but good to you
made some mistakes, but i still love you
i guess i couldn't do for you
the things you wanted me to
like not to screw up from time and time again
to be in love and lie
i guess i couldn't do for you
the things you wanted me to
so i stand here alone
in the midst of singing this song
knowing that i couldn't do for you
the things you wanted me to
ooh, ooh, for, ooh
yes, i couldn't do for you
the things you want me to
but it doesn't mean i don't love you
i do


i see us in the park
strolling the summer days of imaginings in my head
and words from my heart told only to the wind
felt even without being said

i don't wanna bore you with my troubles, yeah
but there's something about your love
that makes me weak and knocks me off my feet
there's something about your love
that makes me weak and knocks me off my feet, knocks me off my feet
and i don't wanna bore you with it
oh but i love you, i love you, i love you
i don't wanna bore you with it
oh but i love you, i love you, i love you, more and more

we lay beneath the stars under a lover's tree
that seems through the eyes of my mind
i reach out for the part of me that lives in you
that only our two hearts can find

  2x 
i don't wanna bore you with it
oh but i love you, i love you, i love you
i don't wanna bore you with it
oh but i love you, i love you


i gotta talk to yall for a minute
because, see, there's a whole lot of men tryna get at a sista
but i tell them, i say, "you know what? i have a man "
they say to me, "but where's your man now?
you're man not there with you
you need a man to be there with you at all times."
but you know, no matter where my baby is
i love him
til my baby comes home, i'll still be here
waiting on him

there's a whole lot of guys
messing around, trying to get me
they do things 'cause they know
my man's away
they try to upset me
they can't believe i resist
how can i hold out
where is my man now
but the truth really is
i don't worry 'cause i love my baby so

no matter where my baby is
he never leaves me without love
he gives me love 'til i get enough
and i'm alright 'til my baby comes home
if he stays away for long
he calls me on the phone
i jump up when i hear his voice
and i'm alright 'til my baby comes home
listen

i get weak in the knees
my hands start to shaking
head starts to aching
is he thinking of me or
feeling the fire with some other girl
i can't believe i can be worried about him
i shouldn't doubt him
cause our love is for real
and i don't worry cause i know, i know, i know

no matter where my baby is
 no matter, no matter, no matter 
he never leaves me without love
 he never, he never, he never 
he gives me love 'til i get enough
 yeah, yeah 
and i'm alright 'tl my baby comes home
 yes i'm alright, yes i'm alright 
if he stays away for long
he calls me on the phone  then he calls me 
i jump up when i hear his voice  and i jump up 
and im alright 'til my baby comes home

you better think again
 she sure better, girl 

if i ever leave you, baby

and if i ever hurt you

is that any way for a man to carry on?
do you think i want my loved one gone?
said, i love you more than you'll ever know
more than you'll ever know
when i wasn't making much money
you know where my paycheck went
you know i brought it home to you, baby
and i never spent a red cent
is that any way for a man to carry on?
do you think i want my loved one gone?
said, i love you more than you'll ever know
more than you'll ever know
now listen to this
i'm not trying to be, just any kind of man, no i ain't
i'm just trying to be somebody
you can love, trust and understand
i know, i know, i know that i can be
a part of you that no one else could see, yeah
but i gotta hear you say, i got to hear you say
it's alright
i'm only flesh and blood
but i could be anything that you demand
i could be king of everything
or just a tiny grain of sand, now tell me
is that anyway for a man to carry on?
do you think that i want my loved one gone?
i love you more than you'll ever know
i said, "i love you, i love, i love you"
don't want nobody else but you

that you wouldn't do for me

you've abandoned me
love don't live here anymore  oh no no 
just a vacancy
love don't live here anymore  oh no, oh no

just emptiness and memories of
what we had before
you went away
found another place to stay, another home

you've abandoned me
love don't live here anymore  no no, no 
just a vacancy
love don't live here anymore  oh, oh 

through the windows of my eyes
everyone can see the loneliness
inside of me
why'd you have to go away?
don't you know i miss you so
i need your love

you've abandoned me
love don't live here anymore  oh, oh

test wyclef, see death flesh get scorned
beat you so bad make you feel like you ain't wanna be born jawn
and tell your friends stay the hell out of my lawn
chicken george became dead george stealing chickens from my farm
damn, another dead pigeon;
if you're mafiosos then i'm bringing on haitian sicilians
nobody's shooting, my body's made of hand grenade
girl bled to death while she was tongue kissing a razor blade

stevie wonder sees crack babies
becoming enemies of their own families 
armageddon come you know we soon done

turn around and look and see what you been missing
look behind you and put on your glasses, forward vision
maybe one day we'll be more than we were way, way back when
maybe then they'll listen
maybe then the world will understand
if you follow me, see mysteries up in the stars
like a rocket ship, your clothes, i wanna take them, take off, off
i'm wounded with you but cured when take my sword
lay here with me, lay here with me, hell yeah

there's no one, no
true love ain't digital, no, no
it's a parallel universe, it's not real

to act like you're mine, in the light and the dark

if you love me, say it
if you trust me, do it
if you want me, show it
if you need me, prove it
if you love me, say it
if you trust me, do it

if you need me, prove it

you see now actions speak louder than words
so don't just say things that i've already heard
don't want your body without your soul

you will not hurt my pride
if right now you decide
that you are not ready to settle down
but if you want my heart
then it's time that you start
to act like you're mine, in the light and the dark

if you love me, say it
if you trust me, do it
if you want me, show it
if you need me, prove it
if you love me, say it
if you trust me, do it
if you want me, show it

i'm the kind of brother
who been doing it my way, getting my way for years
in my career
and every lover
in and out my life, i've hit, love and left the tears
without a care

until i met this girl who turned the tables around
she caught me by surprise
i never thought i'd be the one breaking down
i can't figure it out, why...

i'm so  caught up 
got me feeling it  caught up 
i don't know what it is
but it seems she's got me twisted
i'm so  caught up 
got me feeling it  caught up 
i'm losing control
this girl's got a hold on me

let me go, baby
now, listen...

my mama told me
be careful who you do 'cause karma comes back around
same old song
but i was so sure
that it wouldn't happen to me 'cause i know how to put it down
but i was so wrong

this girl was mean, she really turned me out
her body was so tight, i'm looking for her in the daytime with a flashlight
my homies say this girl is cramping my style
and i can't figure it out, but...

i'm so  caught up 
got me feeling it  caught up 
i don't know what it is
but it seems she's got me twisted
i'm so  caught up 
got me feeling it  caught up 
i'm losing control
this girl's got a hold
i'm so  caught up 
really feeling it  caught up 
i don't know what it is
but it seems she's got me twisted
i'm so  caught up 
really feeling it  caught up 
i'm losing control
this girl's got a hold on me

this girl's got a hold on me


i will not make the same mistakes that you did
i will not let myself cause my heart so much misery
i will not break the way you did, you fell so hard
i've learned the hard way to never let it get that far

because of you
i never stray too far from the sidewalk
because of you
i learned to play on the safe side so i don't get hurt
because of you
i find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me
because of you, i am afraid

i lose my way
and it's not too long before you point it out
i cannot cry
because i know that's weakness in your eyes
i'm forced to fake a smile, a laugh, every day of my life
my heart can't possibly break
when it wasn't even whole to start with

because of you
i never stray too far from the sidewalk
because of you
i learned to play on the safe side so i don't get hurt
because of you
i find it hard to trust
not only me, but everyone around me
because of you
i am afraid

i watched you die, i heard you cry every night in your sleep
i was so young, you should have known better than to lean on me
you never thought of anyone else, you just saw your pain
and now i cry in the middle of the night
for the same damn thing

because of you
i never stray too far from the sidewalk
because of you
i learned to play on the safe side so i don't get hurt
because of you
i try my hardest just to forget everything
because of you
i don't know how to let anyone else in
because of you
i'm ashamed of my life because it's empty
because of you
i am afraid

because of you
because of you


mmm
there will be mountains
that i will have to climb
and there will be battles
that i will have to fight
but victory or defeat, it's up to me to decide
but how can i expect to win if i never try

i just can't give up now
i come too far from where i started from
nobody told me the road would be easy
and i don't believe he's brought me this far
to leave me

never said there wouldn't be trials
never said i wouldn't fall
never said that everything would go
the way i wanted to go  no no no no 
but when my back is against the wall
and i feel all hope is gone
i'll just lift my head up to the sky
and say help me to be strong

i just can't give up now
come too far from where i started from
 oh oh oh 
nobody told me the road would be easy
and i don't believe he's brought me this far
to leave me

out here to leave me lonely

many nights we've prayed
with no proof anyone could hear
in our hearts a hopeful song
we barely understood
now, we are not afraid
although we know there's much to fear
we were moving mountains
long before we knew we could

there can be miracles when you believe
though hope is frail, it's hard to kill
who knows what miracles you can achieve?
when you believe, somehow you will
you will when you believe

in this time of fear
when prayer so often proves in vain
hope seems like the summer birds
too swiftly flown away
yet now i'm standing here
my heart's so full, i can't explain
seeking faith and speaking words
i never thought i'd say

there can be miracles when you believe
though hope is frail, it's hard to kill
who knows what miracles you can achieve?
when you believe, somehow you will
you will when you    believe

they don't always happen when you ask
and it's easy to give in to your fears
but when you're blinded by your pain
can't see your way clear through the rain
a small but still resilient voice says, "help is very near "

there can be miracles when you believe
though hope is frail, it's hard to kill
who knows what miracles you can achieve?
when you believe, somehow you will
now, you will, you will when you believe
you will when you believe, just believe
just believe, you will when you believe

i woke up with a fear this morning
but i can taste you on the tip of my tongue
alarm without no warning
you're by my side and we've got smoke in our lungs

last night we were way up, kissing in the back of the cab
and then you say,  love, baby, let s go back to my flat 
and when we wake up, never had a feeling like that
i got a reason, so man, put that record on again

i don't wanna hear sad songs anymore

don t wanna sing mad songs anymore
only wanna sing your song
'cause your song's got me feeling like i m

i'm in love, i'm in love, i'm in love
yeah, you know, your song's got me feeling like i'm

no fear but i think i'm falling, i'm not proud
but i'm usually the type of girl that would hit and run  oh 
no risk so i think i m all in
when i kiss your lips, feel my heartbeat thump  oh 

and now we re way up, dancing on the roof of the house
and then we make love, right there on your best friend's couch
and then you say,  love, this is what it's all about 
so keep on kissing my mouth and put that record on again

i don't wanna hear sad songs anymore
i only wanna hear love songs
i found my heart up in this place tonight
don t wanna sing mad songs anymore
only wanna sing your song
'cause your song s got me feeling like i'm

yeah, you know your song's got me feeling like i'm

allow me love, i'm a woman of pristine intuition
when i first saw you i knew i'd be loving you
what i didn't forsee, is you'd be all i need
see i thought i'd been in love
but now what i'm sure of is, i've never felt this way
it's the first time, for me
it's the first time, i feel true love
and what it really means, yeah
its the first time its the first time for me
and i tell friends about the love i'm in
and they want me to describe it
i say there are no words but i will try it
it's like beyond the moon and it's all i do
and it knocks me off my feet
and there are moments in the day that i can't breath
it's the first time, for me
it's the first time, i feel
true love and what it really means
yeah, it's the first time, the first time for me
forgive me love, forgive me love, i make me mistakes
and i know sometimes it's more than you can take
but give me one more chance 'cause the circumstance is i'm just a beginner
it's the first time for me, yeah
it's the first time i feel true love
it's the last time, the last time that i'll love this way hey hey
'cause for all time you will be mine, will you be mine for all time
true love and what it really means


if i were a boy
even just for a day
i'd roll out of bed in the morning
and throw on what i wanted and go
drink beer with the guys
and chase after girls
i'd kick it with who i wanted
and i'd never get confronted for it
'cause they'd stick up for me

if i were a boy
i think i could understand
how it feels to love a girl
i swear i'd be a better man
i'd listen to her
'cause i know how it hurts
when you lose the one you wanted
'cause he's taken you for granted
and everything you had got destroyed

if i were a boy
i would turn off my phone
tell everyone it's broken
so they'd think that i was sleepin' alone
i'd put myself first
and make the rules as i go
'cause i'd know that she'd be faithful
waitin' for me to come home
to come home

if i were a boy
i think i could understand
how it feels to love a girl
i swear i'd be a better man
i'd listen to her
'cause i know how it hurts
when you lose the one you wanted  wanted 
'cause he's taken you for granted  granted 
and everything you had got destroyed

it's a little too late for you to come back
say, it's just a mistake
think i'd forgive you like that
if you thought i would wait for you
you thought wrong

but you're just a boy
you don't understand
 yeah, you don't understand, oh 
how it feels to love a girl
someday, you'll wish you were a better man
you don't listen to her
you don't care how it hurts
until you lose the one you wanted
'cause you've taken her for granted
and everything you have got destroyed
but you're just a boy...

and i just wish that i could open her up
to this deeper place of love
high priced snake skin on her arm  oooh 
lace satin covering up her charms
you shoulda seen the way they tossed and turned
the way she made the congregation squirm

girl's got a worldly view
apparently she sees through you
her love was never meant to share for two
she said i'll do it if you'll be my sugah daddy

take a note from my philosophy
i'ma give her what she need
can't snatch the meat out of the lioness mouth
sometimes you gotta just
ease it out
i give her a pacifier
i fill my baby's crib with all the sweetness daddy wants to give
and when it comes to rocking her to sleep, i'll never tire
this is the way i clap my baby on the butt
she had me hooked with only just one glance
she need a spankin', baby, that's wussup
lawd, lawd
you say you wanna be the one she chooses to star in her meaningless romance

girl's got a worldly view
what's a sassy girl to do
and if the decision was left up to me
you best believe that i would be her sugah daddy
brown eyes that will make you blue
eyes that'll see right through you
she crossed her fingers when she said her vows
she said i promise that i'll sock it to you daddy

so i take the child to my crib
i ain't gonna tell you what we did
i hit it so i made the pussy fart
she said it's talkin' to ya, talkin' to ya daddy

lonely pillows in a stranger's bed
little voices in my head
secret keeping, stop the bleeding
lost a little weight because i wasn't eating
all the songs that i can't listen to, to tell the truth

loving you was young, and wild, and free
loving you was cool, and hot, and sweet
loving you was sunshine, safe and sound
a steady place to let down my defenses
but loving you had consequences

hesitation, awkward conversation
running on low expectation
every siren that i was ignoring
i'm paying for it

loving you was young, and wild, and free
loving you was cool, and hot, and sweet
loving you was sunshine, safe and sound
a steady place to let down my defenses
but loving you had consequences

said, no, ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
hey, yeah, no, ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh, mm

loving you was dumb, dark, and cheap
loving you will still take shots at me
found loving you was sunshine, but then it poured
and i lost so much more than my senses
'cause loving you had consequences

yeah, loving you

i wanna turn those blue lights into strobe lights
not blue flashing lights, maybe fairy lights
those blue lights into strobe lights
maybe even fairy lights, not blue flashing lights

don't you run when you hear the sirens coming
when you hear the sirens coming
you better not run 'cause the sirens not coming for you
what have you done?
you went to school that day
was a bit late but it was a monday
kept after class for answering back
you apologized, where's the harm in that

i wanna turn those blue lights
what have you done
into strobe lights
there's no need to run
not blue flashing lights
if you've done nothing wrong
maybe fairy lights
blue lights should just pass you by

gun crime into your right ear
drugs and violence into your left
default white headphones flooding the auditory
subconscious waves you accept
you're sitting on the 4 back home
"where you at, g? answer your phone "
pause the poison to answer his message
your boy sounds rushed, fears for his adolescence

i wanna turn those blue lights
what have you done
into strobe lights
there's no need to run
not blue flashing lights
if you've done nothing wrong
maybe fairy lights
blue lights should just pass you by

tall black shadow as you're getting off the bus
shadow shows no emotion so what's even the fuss?
but the face of your boy casts a darker picture
of the red handed act, he's gonna whisper;
"look blud i'm sorry 'cause i know you got my back
he was running, i couldn't think, i had to get out of that"
not long ago you were miming to the "shook ones"
now this really is part two 'cause you're the shook one
hands you the tool as you question your friendship
how's man like you gonna make me a convict?
level of a felon when i've done nothing wrong
blood on my hands but i don't know where it's from, oh
you got blood on your hands but you don't know where it's from

you better run when you hear the sirens coming
when you hear the sirens coming
better run when you hear the sirens coming
'cause they will be coming for you
run when you hear the sirens coming
better run when you hear the sirens coming
when you hear the sirens coming
the blue lights are coming for you

i wanna turn those blue lights
what have you done
into strobe lights
there's no need to run
not blue flashing lights
if you've done nothing wrong
maybe fairy lights
blue lights should just pass you by

"blud, when you hear the sirens coming"
don't you run when you hear the sirens coming
"blud, when you hear the sirens coming"
don't you run when you hear the sirens coming
what have you d d d done done
don't you run
don't you run
don't you run when you hear the sirens coming


lately, i been going through some changes
been running out of maybes
boy i know you're losing patience
losing patience
losing patience with me

sometimes i get fed up with all the games
sometimes you all just act the same
maybe i'm the one to blame
that's just how the game goes
when you're feeling alone
everybody got somebody that they mess with on the low
now i just want you to save me
i just want you to save me, ohhhh

we got options
but i just wanna let you know that i decided
i finally realized that
all i want is you
you, you, you
you, you, ooo
all i want is you
you, you, you
you, you, ooo

i ain't like all them other girls
you can't treat me like them other girls no more
 no mooore 
you see me like another girl
i've been waiting for you to make a move
 ohhh, oh, oh 

you know that i'm fed up with all the games
you all just act the same
maybe i'm the one to blame
that's just how the game goes
just want someone to hold
everybody needs somebody to be there when they're alone
i just want you to save me  yea 
just want you to save me

we got options
but i just wanna let you know that i decided
i finally realized that
all i want is you
you, you, you
you, you, ooo
all i want is you
you, you, you
you, you, ooo


if i'm giving you the cold shoulder, that's closure
needed someone to hold
but we both had our own motives, never told him that mine was to stay alone
and you don't belong to me
so you don't have to let me go
doesn't always have to be something more
i'll be on my way  i'll be on my way 
i'll be on my way  i'll be on my way 
i'm no good if i stay  i'm no good if i stay 
so i'll be on my way   i'll be on my way 
my way  my way 
i feel it for a moment, in the moment
i feel it 'til it's gone
i don't care if you want this, bein' honest
i don't know what i want
and you don't belong to me

i have yet to find that someone

when i need love?

and my mind is so confusing
who would be that special one?
everyday i'm trying to find you
all along, i've got to know
is there a place for me?
i know love has many names
and a message very clear
all it takes is time and patience
to bring you near
but who got me, tell me

who can i run to
to share this empty space?
who can i run to
when i need love?
who can i run to
to fill this empty space with laughter?

same old story back again
'she's not a lover, she's just a friend'
i'm sick and tired for you to blame on me

now you wanna spend your money on girls
but you forgot when you were down that i was around
call my lover, hang up, call again
what in the world is happening?
listen in, but don't yell at me
isn't it ironic? all you wanna do is smoke chronic
boy, you forgot when you were down who was around

i can't eat, i can't sleep anymore
waiting for love to walk through the door
i wish i didn't miss you anymore  anymore 

memories don't live like people do
i'm sick for ever believing you
wish you'd bring back the man i knew
was good to me, oh, lord
everytime you say you're coming
boy, you disappoint me, honey
how well you forgot when you were down
and i was around

i can't eat, i can't sleep anymore  oh, no, no 
waiting for love to walk through the door
i wish i didn't miss you anymore  anymore 
i can't eat, i can't sleep anymore
waiting for love to walk through the door
i wish i didn't miss you anymore  anymore 

one of these days, it's gonna happen to you
missing a love like i'm missing you, babe, yeah, yeah

and the lord ask me what i did with my life
i will say i spent it with you

if i wake up in world war 3
i see destruction and poverty
and i feel like i want to go home
it's okay if you're comin' with me

cause your love is my love
and my love is your love
it would take an eternity to break us
and the chains of amistad couldn't hold us
cause your love is my love
and my love is your love
it would take an eternity to break us
and the chains of amistad couldn't hold us

if i lose my fame and fortune
and i'm homeless on the street
and i'm sleepin' in grand central station
it's okay if you're sleepin' with me

as the years they pass us by
we stay young through each other's eyes
and no matter how old we get
it's okay as long as i got you babe

cause your love is my love
and my love is your love
it would take an eternity to break us
and the chains of amistad couldn't hold us
cause your love is my love
and my love is your love
it would take an eternity to break us
and the chains of amistad couldn't hold us

if i should die this very day  very, very day

it would take an eternity to break us
and the chains of amistad couldn't hold us
cause your love is my love
and my love is your love
it would take an eternity to break us
and the chains of amistad couldn't hold us


i hear the drizzle of the rain
it's falling from my window
and in the corners of my mind
i hope that i'll get to see you again
la da di da di da di da di my friend
i hear the colors in the flowers
just like the candle snuffed at dawn
you're here, you're near, you're there and then you're gone
la da die da die da die da die

suffering in sinking sand
all the hurt
see, i'm really lost, baby
we suffered a rare, rare blue
so much hurt
on this earth
but you loved me
and i really dared to love you, too
perhaps what i mean to say is
is that it's amazing that your love was mine

oh, maker, tell me did you know
this love would burn so yellow?
becoming orange and, in its time
explode from grey to black then bloody wine
la da di da di da di da di
oh, maker, have you ever loved
or known just what it was?
i can't imagine the bitter end
of all the beauty that we're living in
oh, no

suffering in sinking sand
all the hurt
see, i'm really lost, baby
we suffered a rare, rare blue
so much hurt
on this earth
but you loved me
and i really dared to love you, too
perhaps what i mean to say is
is that it's amazing that your love was mine

lost inside a lonely world where lovers pay the price
barely get the sound of music to love and go dance to
now it's time for us to go and no one ever has to know
your love's in my pocket and your eyes, eyes are in my
eyes in my soul, no one will know it but me

staring in the mirror as i
start to carefully contemplate
just really how deep is this thing i have for you
it's wearing on my heart
and from the start you know i tried, steadily denied
friendship turn to love
i know you probably think that i'm so strange  
stuttering on every word when you look my way, why?
and maybe it's all in my mind
but when we hugged goodbye i had butterflies
i just died  yeah yeah yeah 
i just died in your arms tonight
don't want nobody to bring me back to life
 i just died in your arms tonight, hey 
i just died in your arms
i just died in your arms tonight, tonight
your finger touched my lips
as i tried to explain maybe why you and i should hide from such a love
affair
my friends think that i'm so insane
to fight this feeling
but my life's at stake
your embrace, thoughts won't erase
every now a minute of the day i wait and hope and pray
that you might stay
and now you're moving oh so closely
killing me so softly, so softly
i just died
i just died in your arms tonight
don't want nobody to bring me back to life
 i just died in your arms tonight, hey 
i just died in your arms
i just died in your arms tonight, tonight
i just died in your arms tonight
don't want nobody to bring me back to life
 i just died in your arms tonight, hey 
i just died in your arms
i just died in your arms tonight, tonight
 musical interlude 
i just died in your arms tonight
don't want nobody to bring me back to life
 i just died in your arms tonight, hey 
i just died in your arms
i just died in your arms tonight, tonight
i just died in your arms tonight

let's do it, do it

even if you were a million miles away
i could still feel you in my bed
near me, touch me, feel me
and even at the bottom of the sea
i could still hear inside my head
tellin' me, touch me, feel me

and all the time you were tellin' me lies

so tonight, i'm gonna find a way to make it without you
tonight i'm gonna find a way to make it without you
i'm gonna hold on to the times that we had tonight
i'm gonna find a way to make it without you

have you ever tried sleeping with a broken heart?
well, you could try sleeping in my bed

lonely, only nobody ever shut it down like you
you wore the crown
you made my body feel heaven bound
why don't you hold me
near me, i thought you told me
you'd never leave me
looking in the sky i could see your face
and i know right where i fit in
take me, make me, you know that i'll always be in love
with you
right til the end
ooh

so tonight, i'm gonna find a way to make it without you
tonight i'm gonna find a way to make it without you
i'm gonna hold on to the times that we had tonight
i'm gonna find a way to make it without you

anybody could've told you right from the start
it's about to fall apart
so rather than hold on to a broken dream
or just hold on to love
and i could find a way to make it
don't hold on too tight
i'll make it without you tonight

so tonight, i'm gonna find a way to make it without you
tonight i'm gonna find a way to make it without you
i'm gonna hold on to the times that we had tonight
i'm gonna find a way to make it without you

oh, lord
have you ever tried sleepin' with a
without my love
have you ever tried, have you ever tried


i will not make the same mistakes that you did
i will not let myself cause my heart so much misery
i will not break the way you did, you fell so hard
i've learned the hard way to never let it get that far

because of you
i never stray too far from the sidewalk
because of you
i learned to play on the safe side so i don't get hurt
because of you
i find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me
because of you, i am afraid

i lose my way
and it's not too long before you point it out
i cannot cry
because i know that's weakness in your eyes
i'm forced to fake a smile, a laugh, every day of my life
my heart can't possibly break
when it wasn't even whole to start with

because of you
i never stray too far from the sidewalk
because of you
i learned to play on the safe side so i don't get hurt
because of you
i find it hard to trust
not only me, but everyone around me
because of you
i am afraid

i watched you die, i heard you cry every night in your sleep
i was so young, you should have known better than to lean on me
you never thought of anyone else, you just saw your pain
and now i cry in the middle of the night
for the same damn thing

because of you
i never stray too far from the sidewalk
because of you
i learned to play on the safe side so i don't get hurt
because of you
i try my hardest just to forget everything
because of you
i don't know how to let anyone else in
because of you
i'm ashamed of my life because it's empty
because of you
i am afraid

because of you
because of you


i found myself dreaming in silver and gold
like a scene from a movie that every broken heart knows
we were walking on moonlight, and you pulled me close
split second and you disappeared and then i was all alone
i woke up in tears, with you by my side
a breath of relief, and i realized
no, we're not promised tomorrow

so i'm gonna love you like i'm gonna lose you
i'm gonna hold you, like i'm saying goodbye
wherever we're standing, i won't take you for granted
cause we'll never know when
when we'll run out of time
so i'm gonna love you, like i'm gonna lose you
i'm gonna love you, like i'm gonna lose you

in the blink of an eye, just a whisper of smoke
you could lose everything, the truth is you never know
so i'll kiss you longer babe  hey  any chance that i get
i'll make the most of the minutes and love with no regret
so let's take our time to say what we want
use what we got before it's all gone
no, we're not promised tomorrow

so i'm gonna love you like i'm gonna lose you
i'm gonna hold you, like i'm saying goodbye
wherever we're standing, i won't take you for granted
cause we'll never know when
when we'll run out of time
